39926603 I bought a Refurbished Dell Laptop from MPC Deals aka Metro Business Systems aka metropc.com on the Best Buy Marketplace. The laptop they sent me was not even close to the one i ordered. Took almost 3 weeks to get the replacement. The replacement Laptop did not function at all, it was actually visibly missing critical parts! Couldnt even turn it on. almost 2 weeks later i finally got a refund. Over 1 month. Hours on the phone with them. No laptop. At least i got my money back eventually.

Simplify the use of your tablet with this Asus docking station that features a keyboard for easy typing. The docking station's lithium-ion battery provides up to 15 hours of extended battery life for long-lasting use of your tablet.


..

39926603 Already liked my tablet - now I love it! The extended battery life is a huge plus.

..

39926603 I bought this for my wife to be like a netbook. I couldn't ask for anything more! I bought an external HD so we can load up pictures an movies onto the tablet. The dock makes the tablet more useful and should be a nessecity! I got this on sale and the red is a perfect color!

..

39926603 This is a nice little docking station for the Asus TF300T. It preforms great an makes it easier to use the tablet. The only catch is the battery life of he dock does not mirror the tablet an if you have to use it for more then 3 to 4 hours you will have to charge it an un dock the tablet an use it with out the keyboard. But that is the only problem I see, my wife loves it an does not complain. So as long as she is happy I am as well. So in my eyes cause she is happy this product preforms as advertised. I would recommended it to anyone with the TF300T Model.

..

39926603 This product was a great fit for our new tablet, matching color and increasing battery life and it makes tablet more versatile.

..

39926603 The mouse pad is really touchy and I haven't figured a way to adjust it, thus 4 stars. It makes a tablet a little more productive , not just a surfing tool.

..

39926603 This product is great for not just home-office but as well as a day-to-day use.
This is a great thing to have when writing a pa[er or report on your tablet. its easy and portable and i love this.

..

39926603 Bought a new keyboard based on recommendation of Asus service technician. It did not help me resolve my problem with tablet.
Now have two keyboards and a useless tablet.

..

39926603 Have a keyboard is one thing, but triplin the battery life is awesome!

..

39926603 I have use this mainly for work.(emails and notes for work) The keyboard docking station has added even more battery life to my TF300T. Sometime you just need a physical keyboard to get the job done. I have used this for over a month and no problems. Everything on the keyboard docking station works. (Card reader and usb port). I added an sd card to it, for even more storage. Basically its now a netbook. Works great!

..

39926603 This keyboard works great with my Asus tablet. It attaches and detaches very easily, and works very well when attached. I also got it for a great price thanks to Deal of the Day. I don't think I'm getting close to an extra 15 hours of battery life, but I'm still happy with it and would recommend it.

39926603 This tablet's touch screen either does not work, or randomly does it's own thing (opens apps on its own, types things on it's own) on a frequent basis. This tablet has been well cared for, always in a case/screen protector, and never dropped. I sent it in to Asus twice just before the warranty expired. The first time I got it back from them, they said nothing was wrong with it. The second time, they apparently replaced the touch screen. Within a week of getting it back, I was having all the same problems again, but because I was in the process of moving to another state, I couldn't do anything about it then. I cannot get it fixed because I am now out of warranty. I will never purchase an Asus product again! The product and the warranty service are both useless. My brother bought a Samsung Galaxy Note Tablet that I use when the Asus is giving me fits, and I love it. I will be Purchasing one of those very soon.

..

39926603 I bought this tablet with great excitement for my husband for our anniversary. He has wanted this for a long time but we could not afford a new one. I saw this one refurbished and jumped at the chance. Received it quickly and wrapped it up. My husband was thrilled... until we found that the touch screen did not work properly and despite a 24 hour charge, the tablet showed no power. I immediately wrote to seller, nothing, wrote again.... nothing.... again and got an auto out of office response.... again and was directed to another person. She gave me permission to send it back however I was told I needed to wait for UPS to send me a mailing label. I used my Best Buy Credit card so time was of the essence as I don't wait to be charged interest on something that never worked. A full 3 weeks later I received a return label. I immediately packaged and brought to the UPS store. Today I received an email it was received and my refund is to be processed in 2-3 days.... I will tell you I found the same tablet at Tiger Direct for a few dollars more... it's fantastic and working. I would never do business with this seller again.

39926603 I purchased this tablet over a year ago. From day one I noticed that I will get a lot of errors when launching apps it wills say app is not responding and ask to close it. At the beginning I thought I could be a hardware/app problem not the tablet itself. However as of today it keeps closing apps unexpectedly. After 4-6 months after I purchased I started noticing that the battery will deplete the battery even if turned off a day after full charge. I normally do not play games or handle large apps that will require charger to be plugged at all times. I contacted Asus and send back my tablet for repairs. They complete their repair, however after a year the tablet seems not to be able to handle apps because I will always get the not responding warning I get frustrated and put back my tablet. The tablet is rarely used and its on original conditions, rarely use it due to low performance. I tried to trade off my Asus tablet for a different tablet and brand, but the tradeoff was only for $89 when I paid almost $700 for the tablet and keyboard combo. Not acceptable. Now I am stocked with a like new tablet which cannot performs any task. I once, wanted to purchase an Asus laptop, however, after this experience and the low quality for high price items. I will never go back to Asus. I hope we all collectively sue Asus for their low performance products or be able to get my money back for their not working products. Very disappointed

39926603 The ASUS Tranformer Infinity pad is easy to use. It comes with 32GB of internal memory and storage, but you can use SD Cards as well. I have used many tablets and by far this is the best one that I have used. This tablet is easy for beginners and advanced users to use.

..

39926603 I purchased an ASUS tablet just over a year ago. I loved it, I got the keyboard and they have been a great combination for me. I use it primarily to access my work desktop and to read technical documents when I travel. In August it just refused to power on. Just before this, it started getting slow about powering on, I would have to hit the button several times. The green light would come on showing it was charging, but that was all it would do, even after several resets. I contacted ASUS online, had a very efficient conversation and got it RMA'd, it took a while, but I got it back working for just the shipping. Now, 5 months later it is doing the same thing, and now out of warranty. I loved it, but that is too much money to spend for a device that barely lasts over a year.

..

39926603 I purchase an Asus tablet less than a year ago. Within 2 months I had to send it back for repairs. That cost me $25. It has been one issue after another. The tablet freezes up. Apps suddenly disappear and have to be reinstalled. Recently, it kept rebooting and fortunately I was able to do a factory reset in between reboots. Now, only a week later, I can no longer charge the tablet with the power chord. I have to connect it to the dock. Interestingly, the power chord WILL charge the dock.
I called Customer Service 8 times in 2 days. Got disconnected from Chat 3 times and in the end NO ONE knows what the problem is. In the end I was told to send the tablet to Asus for repair. Not happening when it will cost at least another $25! My tablet should have been THOROUGHLY checked out when it was in for repair the first time. Obviously, it wasn't.
I might add, I am not the only customer having these problems. I have found numerous complaints online along with numerous poor reviews.

..

39926603 This is our first tablet. We are on our 2nd Asus due to the first one dying suddenly after 364 days. Yes we were saved by the last day of our warranty period. Best Buy gave us a brand new Asus replacement with not questions asked. We use this mainly to check emails and to read the daily newspaper and occasional book. Our grandkids take it over on their visits. We always end up with new game apps when they leave. This tablet worked flawlessly until Jan 2nd of this year. It would not power on. The night before our grand kids had used it all night long and I think that was the reason for the sudden death. We are very happy with the way it works and what it does.

..

39926603 Screen will jump around with in a year. Is a known issue and ASUS will not replace. I've gone through 2 ASUS tablets TF300 and TF700. They both lasted about 1 year and then went bonkers. Warranty will not replace.. JUNK JUNK JUNK..

..

39926603 Bought last spring. Seemed okay at first, but slowly began running sluggish and laggy. My smartphone performed the same tasks much faster. I finally got disgusted enough to send it in to ASUS service and it was gone for 6 weeks. Got it back and it was no better. They said they tested it and it was okay. I put up with it for a few weeks, but my wife's ipad 2 and even my three daughters' Samsungs were smoother and quicker. So I sent it in again. This time I got it back in about 2 weeks, but again they said they tested it and it was 'okay'. However, this time I noticed a small dent next to the charge port that was not there before. I reported it to ASUS and they had me take a picture and email it to them. I did so, they assigned my a case number and an RMA number and I sent it back to them yesterday. They sent me a prepaid label for FedEx, which was nice, but I had to drive to the FedEx store which is 30 minutes away. The label could not be scanned properly by a FedEx driver. What a hassle. I almost bought the higher end Samsung tablet. Wish I had. My sister in law has one and it performs very well, smoother than my wife's ipad 2.

..

39926603 I decided to get a tablet after my laptop was reaching the end of it's life. After debating between an iPad, Windows, or Android tablet, I decided on this Asus pad because the reviews had it as a top Android Tablet.
After using the tablet for a couple weeks, I realized how underwhelming the device was. Aside from most of the Android apps being just stretched phone apps, the device was not running well. Apps would freeze, the device would lock up, and eventually it would reset and reboot itself because it would freeze so badly. For some reason, the Wifi would not work correctly either. Every other device in my home gets at least 20MBPS through Wifi, and this tablet was consistently getting less than 1. I'm sure this caused some of the lagging. Everything with the device seemed to not work. I even had issues with the clocks on the device not matching. The one on the dash would say 1:43 and the one in the corner would say 9:57.
After contacting Asus, they told me to ship the device back and they would fix it. After about a month with them, they sent it back to me and claim they had to replace the motherboard in the device. At first, it seemed to be better, but now after about 2 weeks the device is back to its old ways. I have tried factory resets, uninstalling apps, and removing widgets, but nothing has worked. This is an unreliable tablet and I highly suggest not purchasing it. The fact that Asus repaired it and it still functions poorly makes me believe that it is the product, and not just this one I have. I only wish I could return it for an iPad.
Be warned. I'm not an Apple person (only product I own is an iPod) but I can honestly say Android tablets have not won me over.

..

39926603 Here are the facts:
- initially, I was thrilled with the tablet. Great display, easy to set up, great to watch shows and movies on, check email, read magazines through google play... The docking station with keyboard made typing reallyeasy. All in all, a lovely device.
- except for the sound quality, which is terrible. You will need speakers or headphones to watch anything.
- however, it had a technical failure of the micro-HDMI port after less than 7 months of use.
- when I went to Best Buy's Geek Squad, after 30-40 minutes waiting in line, they were unable to help me. They told me I had to contact Asus directly. The existence of the Geek Squad was one of the selling points for me to buy the device, knowing that I could speak to someone in person and have issues resolved quickly (Best Buy's response to the Genius Bar, I thought...).
- it took me almost a whole day to deal with Asus customer service and send the device. I had to go on what Asus calls "live chat", where you discuss your issues with a customer service representative via an instance messenger service. They were helpful enough - I got all the necessary information about how to send the device to be inspected and repaired.
- but then I had to go to a USPS (Fedex or UPS would have worked too) and mail it. It cost me $15 to ship to Grapevine TX.
- the package arrived 3 weeks ago according to USPS tracking and has not been entered into the Asus tracking system. In other words Asus lost the device.
- another Live Chat with customer service yielded no answers and I was given no definitive timeline for when I would receive information.
I think the facts speak for themselves: faulty device, misleading marketing (leading me to believe issues could be resolved by the Geek Squad), slow and cumbersome customer service, poor follow-up and lack of responsiveness. So despite the fact that during those 7 months I had the device, it was great and I loved it, the past month of schlepping and waiting and getting on live chats has sort put a dent in my appreciation of the device.
To put this into perspective, I have had a Macbook since Nov 2008, and every time I have had a problem with it, it was resolved within less than a day by going to the Apple store. The product is still working very well 5 years later, and at no point did the process of keeping it that way make me want to tear my hair out. Meanwhile the Asus tablet I have had for less than a year is somewhere in Texas and I have no assurance if and when it will be repaired or returned to me.
I'm not saying Mac products are inherently better than Asus. In fact I specifically chose an Asus tablet over an iPad because I wanted to be able to watch TV shows and movies without having to go through iTunes. Apple is very proprietary about its apps, while the Android platform is much more open source. But at the end of the day, better a bird in the hand than 3 in the bush (as in - I still don't have my tablet back and it's been a month since I sent it in for repairs!).
I hope this feedback helps.

39926603 great price,excellent quality ,nice picture and fast!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

..

39926603 This is a great tablet for the money. As far as I am concerned not much different than an I-pad.

..

39926603 Great product and an excellent value. This was a gift for my wife and she loves it. Don't over pay for an apple product. This tablet does everything you could possibly want and more. Even or 3 year old cam operate it with ease.

..

39926603 My kids absolutel;y love this tablet. they download alot of games. Very easy to manage.

..

39926603 I had a previous Android tablet that finally failed. While looking through reviews and testing the actual product in the store, I had my heart set on another model tablet when the salesperson asked if I had considered the ASUS MeMO Smart. I was blown away by the crisp graphics and how light the tablet was. SOLD!

..

39926603 I am glad to have gotten this. Would buy it again.

..

39926603 Bought this tablet for my wife as a birthday present. Principle use was to do basic web browsing, and to connect to our tv to watch movies on netflix, youtube,etc. After a few days of working fine, the internet failed to connect. All other devices at our home connected fine. We took it to a few public places to connect to their wi-fi and could not. We took the tablet back to have them look at it, and they said it was fine. We tried again and even asked a few tech savy little brothers, and they both concluded the tablet was the issue. We finally returned it and got a different insignia model that cost less, and has given us no issues.

..

39926603 I purchased this after spending several weeks reading reviews. I didn't want an iPad because I'm Android-oriented. I compared the Asus Memo to the Galaxy Tab 3 and found the benefits to exceed the Tab. The key selling point were the reviews indicating the that the Memo didn't have the root app overload of the Tab, which is a plus.
I haven't had any problems with my screen protector effecting functionality or anything like that. The speakers are great, but I wish that there was an external volume control.
I just discovered the multi-user option so that each user can download his on apps and emails.
I'm quite satisfied with my purchase.

..

39926603 For my first tablet compared to the Samsung galaxy this is just mind blowing. The picture quality is to line, what's even better is the screen has the gorilla glass and my dog has jumped on it several times and not one scratched it. It picks up wifi very easily. The setting features are easy to understand and to use. The camera on this tablet takes very good night time pictures. Over alk this is an easy and user tablet for its price!

..

39926603 This is a good tablet for the money, I like the choice of applications for the Android OS.

..

..

39926603 Spent $450 new at bestbuy and this tablet will no longer hold a chrge after 14 months. Do NOT waste your money on this as you will be VERY dissapointed. As for functionality is WAS a great tablet but will never buy another ASUS again.

39926603 My oldest so s off to college and after much research chose this tablet for its balance of battery life, power, features and a keyboard. AWESOME.

..

39926603 the asus transformer is a good tablet. it has good resolution and a great rear facing camera. i was able to upgrade os to jellybean tablet runs very smooth.

..

39926603 Amazed with clarity, sharpness, sound. Easy to navigate especially if you are not a techy.

..

39926603 This is an awesome tablet for the price. Had to drive 80 miles to the only store still in stock for this closeout. Well worth it. Great graphics, ease of use, good battery life, quad core processor anazing. Size and weight is perfect for balance.

..

39926603 I loved this tablet, it brings great connectivity with the USB and bluetooth connection. It also allows for adding extra memory and has a micro HDMI connection. Screen is very cool and has DUAL camera so it's perfect for skyping as well. It also brings Jelly Bean and there was an update by Asus which greatly improved the look of the keyboard.
Best tablet around!

..

39926603 I had been shopping for a tablet for a while. I like the iPads but my phone is Android, so I wanted tablet that would have similar interface and app's as my phone. Mostly use it for personal use but some business when I don't want to carry a laptop. For the price and how I use it, I am very happy with it.

..

39926603 As stated in the title, this tablet offers great bang for the buck.
Has a fast quad core CPU, 10" 10.1" LED Backlight WXGA (1280x800) IPS panel with wide viewing angles, but is still easy on the battery.
What really set this apart from other tablets is that it also has a HDMI port (e.g. able to connect to a HDTV) and microSD card support for extended storage.
Was also able to upgrade to latest Jelly Bean (latest Android OS).

..

39926603 Good performance. Plays most videos. Internet browsing could be better. Plays most games. Battery life less than 5 hrs playing games, could be better

..

39926603 I love my tablet. You can't beat all its qualities for the price. I just wish the accessories easier to find.

..

39926603 I got it for $99 so it was worth it...............

39926603 Do NOT purchase this machine. Best Buy, Geek Squad and ASUS do not back this machine, and the hard drive on mine failed on month 4 of ownership with light use. Just one months AFTER the 90 warrenty to expire. I thought ASUS hard drives lasted longer then that but I was mistaken.

6006839590008 These picks were thinner than I expected. They have a very good grip. I would buy these again but with the correct thickness.

6006839590008 I am happy that I purchased them, they are exactly what I was looking for

..

6006839590008 I like them. They are nice and light. I call them cheater picks. As far as i know not to many people use them. But I like a light pick. Try them, you might like them. If you play light it might be the pick for you, or maybe not.

Extend your dynamic range with these Ernie Ball Power Slinky P02720 electric guitar strings that feature cobalt material to ensure crisp, clean highs and enhanced low-end sound.


..

6006839590008 They are the best guitar strings I have ever used...

..

6006839590008 Let me preface by saying that I do not care for Ernie Ball strings, but I am now a firm believer with these new Cobalt strings. The tone is brighter, focused and very smooth to the touch. I bought two sets initially, still on my first set and so far after one week they still sound phenomenal. These strings will wake up your guitar.

..

6006839590008 I restrung my Stratocaster on 12-24-2013. I am restringing her today, 1-5-2014.
At first these strings deliver on their promise of a good rock throaty grumble, but after a few weeks they are as dead as yesterdays mackerel.
Maybe they are meant for a stage performer who can afford to change strings in between performances but for someone whose just playing and learning they are simply not worth the extra price.
If it matters to anyone, I will be stringing with my favorite Ernie Ball Slinky nickels ....

..

6006839590008 There are by far the best guitar strings on the market....

..

6006839590008 New EB Cobalts:
These strings are extremely bright, did notice quite a bit more output as well. They feel like flat wound/nickel strings which aren't for me, also they were dead in one week. Not cool at S9.99 a pack!
Back to Regular Slinky's for me, You do have to try them though to find out for yourself if these are duds or studs!

..

6006839590008 It has very brite tone. I can really hearl the diffrence after I put them on. Last time I had the same feeling was when I had my first set of Elixir. I dont know about you guys but I had to plug my guitar to the tuner to tune my electric guitar but with these strings, I dont have to. I can do it as if it's acoustic since the tone is so brite.

..

6006839590008 my son has 6 music man guitars and one EVH he wont even think of other strings. He set up his string test at the university under controlled conditions. there was no comparison in frequency response and duration. he prefers passive pickups.

..

6006839590008 These strings did have a much noticeably crisper brightness and a definate ring to them. I used these on a old norlin era lester with overwound t-top humbuckr in the neck and a overwound dimarzio on the bridge .33uF spraque caps with 500k pushpull coil tap pot on the bridge pickup. Even when bridge is coiltapped this axe has always been very warm and even muddy. These strings did bring out more ring but the effects wore off after three or four sessions at which time I was ready to change the strings out anyways.
The price is marginally worth the add benefit. If I had a tone I wanted for a special studio project .... yeah it might help. I think I should just save up and get some good paf pups instead of trying to put a bandaid on the "problem" It would be interesting to hear these on a strat with the classic a.y. CS 69's vintage classic pups!?!

5.11 RUSH 24 Carrying Case (Backpack) for Travel Essential - Sandstone - Water Resistant - Nylon


..

6006840060008 This is a great pack! I have taken it camping, hiking, on the air plane, strapped on the motorcycle, even a great range bag. It's just small enough to use as a day pack. It holds my 17 inch Macbook Pro and my camelbak water bladder. Fully loaded I don't feel it pulling on my shoulders. It looks nice and dirt just brushes off of it. It's not water proof but it will take a good rain and the inside is still dry. I recommend this bag for just about any every day task. If you buy it, and you don't use the bladder pocket. I would suggest 5.11's water bottle attachment.

Ideal for bird-watchers, hunters and naturalists, this Barska Colorado CO11502 waterproof spotting scope offers 20-60x magnification to bring distant objects close. The waterproof and fog-proof design allows use in a variety of weather conditions.


..

6006840060008 I bought this to be used strictly as a spotting scope for the range. at 20x zoom, the target is clear and easy to see. 90% of my shooting is at 100yds, so the 60x zoom won't be used often. Overall, a good scope for the money if you're using it for shooting.

These Barska Gladiator Zoom AB11180 binoculars feature an 8-24x magnification range for clear viewing of wide areas, such as long-distance terrestrial or celestial expanses. The zoom thumb lever makes it easy to make quick zoom adjustments.


..

6006840060008 The first order, they came with a broken top focus lens that was completely cracked all around only being held on by the rubber eye piece and also cracked in other sorts of ways on the inside. The second set they lenses don't even turn at all and are not lined up, one is a bit up from the other; basically your one eye is up and the other is a bit down from the other. I don't recommend anyone to get these. Both orders were defective/damaged. There is also a 10-30 version of these as well.

The Bluetooth technology of this Acoustic Research Skinit AWSBTSK portable speaker allows you to wirelessly stream music from a Bluetooth-enabled device from up to 32.8' away for easy use.


..

6006840060008 My son has this speaker in his yard and it works great and looks nice. I was pleased with the price and also the promptness of its arrival!

..

6006840060008 I got this from Best Buy - opened it plugged the AC power adapter and pressed the power button (it was supposed to blink blue light) - nothing happened no matter how long and hard i pressed the power button. The speaker was "Dead on Arrival". I am not sure if this is a common issue or I've got a bad device.

..

6006840060008 This is a good product for iPhone and iPad, It uses the blue tooth capability to vastly improve the sound quality.

..

6006840060008 This speaker is fine, it's not great. Set up took minutes, but was disappointed in the sound. Volume level is okay, just no way to adjust output and the bass is not great. Will use it especially for outdoors.

..

6006840060008 I ordered the Acoustic Research Bluetooth Speaker on December 26, 2013 and received the product on January 2, 2014. The speaker was paired with my MAC and two iPhones within 10 minutes. The sound is great considering the size, and the portability is very practical. I intend to use for my trips to the beach and weekly outings. Another added bonus is the auto shut-off when the speaker is not in use.

..

6006840060008 Great item I recommend it. Super sound quality. Easy to use.

..

6006840060008 If I knew this item was this wonderful I would have purchase more than 1 when it was on sale. Watching for the next sale.

..

6006840060008 The batteries lasted me many hours on full volume at the beach. Sounds great. Much better than the speakers that are smaller than your hand and not as heavy as a homemade ice chest system.
I would highly recommend for outside festivities. Bluetooth is super easy to use also.

..

6006840060008 I have a lot of music on my IPad, but of course the sound wasn't very good. I had bought really cheap speakers and they were, of course, disappointing also. This speaker sounds very good without costing a fortune.

..

6006840060008 This bluetooth speaker is awesome. Easy to connect to different devices, excellent high, mid, and low range. I listened outside and it was very clear and full sound. 4 of us took turns connecting our iphones to have a wide variety of music and it was simple to connect and disconnect.

Comfortably type on your iPad 2 or iPad (3rd Generation) using this Adonit Writer Plus ADW3B Bluetooth keyboard. The keyboard detaches easily, letting you use the rubber-covered, suede-interior folio to protect your device from damage on the go.


..

6006840060008 The case itself was poor quality. The keyboard seems to be acceptable but not usable without the case. I tried taking back to the store but they wouldn't take it back.

..

6006840060008 The unit worked great out of the box. There were no issues synching with the ipad. It is easy to adjust for better viewing.

..

6006840060008 I bought this product just as the school semester came to an end. So, I have not had the opportunity to really test it for my actual needs. The initial testing phase has went very well, though.

..

6006840060008 This cover/keyboard is perfect for me when I travel for conferences as I do not have to carry laptop or my other bulky iPad cover. The keybaord is easy to link to the iPad and the charge lasts for quite a bit. However, I do not use this cover when I'm at home as I need better protection for my iPad from my kids.

..

6006840060008 Good price point. Works well. Makes the iPad more functional.

..

6006840060008 The keyboard itself is great. I even wondered about keeping it just for the keyboard. But, the rest of the case was awful. I kept digging in the box to find the real case.

..

6006840060008 I bought this based on the description. I didn't like it at all after I received it. The quality of the material was very inferior. It was sharp around the edges and it didn't look good with my iPad. I had to return it.

..

6006840060008 Highly Recommend:
I was pleasantly surprised when I received this iPad keyboard and cover. The keyboard is very good and even has built-in iPad functioning keys (i.e. lock screen, home key, search key, mute, cut-copy-paste, etc.). The battery lasts generally 2 weeks before recharging (according to instructions). Cover automatically turns off keyboard and the iPad when in closed folded position. You can adjust the screen at various angles. The keyboard can detach while the screen is standing up toward you - very cool ! The keyboard and cover feel great and sturdy. The Writer uses a magnet to stay close. You can even use it in your lap. Keyboards are always personal preference. But, work with it for a while and you will love this set.
There is no way to adjust keyboard position - lies flat. There is No way to replace the rechargeable battery. The on/off switch is hard to operate, but the unit shuts off automatically when it is closed. The cover will not provide 100% protection from drops.

6006840060008 
Rock out with this 2-channel Behringer Ultrabass bass amplifier head that features a switchable Ultrabass subharmonics processor to ensure robust low-end tone. Class D amplifier technology delivers powerful sound.


..

6006840060008 I bought this amp despite there being no reviews, I think it is a relatively new product from Behringer. Overall, for $180, a 300 W amp with the features that this amp has is a steal. I play in a band (heavy metal) and have to get loud enough to compete with a ENGL 100W amp and a 150W Line6 amp plugged into a 4x12 Mesa cab, plus I ned to cut through the drums and vocals. The fact this my set up cuts through the HIGH end equipment that cost exponentially more than my gear is remarkable. I have a custom made P-bass (mohagany body, maple neck and GFS pickups, 4 strings tuned to Drop C) and a custom 1x18 cab with a tweeter at 8ohm resistance. I use a Digitech BP200 multi-effects pedal as a preamp. I have no issue cutting through and with the input and master volume at 5, it vibrates the house and I need to play with earplugs. I was previously using a 2x12 100W guitar amp for my bass. I was missing low end and I had to crank the volume so loud that the amp cab started rattling. I am very happy with this amp.
Features that are great:
Class D technology- ultra clean with a frequency range of 20 Hz to 20kHz, you can plug a bass or guitar into it and it sounds great. Looking online, a lot of the old school tube amp guys are getting into Class D because it is so clean. It doesn't require much power and has not gotten hot yet, despite the fact that I push it pretty hard for up to 4 hours straight. It only weighs 7 lbs, which is great since hauling around heavy equipment every week is annoying. The guitar amp I was using is 50 lbs.
Ultrabass function - some people may not like this but I have been using it when playing higher notes in some songs, sounds awesome when bass is playing notes at two octaves, hitting the same notes as lead guitar.
7 band Graphic Equalizer with FBQ response - Just a great function to have to dial in your sound, most amps <$500 have three band EQ.
Distortion - Not something I use regularly since bass doesn't typically mix well with distortion except when playing higher notes, but the distortion sound on this amp is pretty good . It isn't very aggressive, when I plug my six string into it, its a moderate distortion. It is not a tube overdrive, bluesy or heavy metal distortion but I do like the distortion sound. Most <$500 bass amps don't have a distortion feature.
Line in Gain- Great to have to dial in input levels depending if you have active or passive pickups.
Footswitch - great to have a stomp pedal to activate ultrabass and switch between clean/distortion.
Music in, headphones out - haven't used these features yet since I can do it with the BP200 but they are great features to have.
Overall, this amp has all the basic bells and whistles noted above, most bass amps don't have fancy multi effects you can find integrated with guitar amps such as the Line6 Spider series. It gets very loud and is a really good price. I have had it for over a month and pushed it hard and have no issues yet. The fact that there is a two year warranty on it is also great. I can dial in my sound easily, and right now i have 3 bass settings on my BP200 for trebly/twangy sound, deep bass sound, and a light chorus for bass tapping. I usually fingerpick but it still sounds great using a plectrum or slapping.
Dislikes:
There is a small, loose piece of platic in the enclosure, I could open it up and take it out but it doesnt affect the function of the amp. It is just something that shouldn't be there.
Plastic Enclosure - It is not really an issue but a steel or aluminum construction would be cool. There is a plastic ridge on the bottom instead of feet, which makes it vibrate and move on my cab because it is a wood construction, but i remedy this with a thin rubber mat.
Best Buy had the best price on this amp, only comparing with Amazon but it had a longer warranty, and if I ever have any issues I can just go to the store instead of dealing with customer service over the phone and having to ship it. I did extensive reasearch online looking for an amp that fit my budget, and the BXD3000H was the best bang for my buck by far. I havent heard many bass amps, so I can't compare it to another amp but I don't really care to because this amp has the sound, output and versatility that I wanted.

Enjoy on-the-go entertainment with this Belkin @TV Plus G1V1000 set-top box, which allows you to watch live TV and DVR-recorded programs on a Wi-Fi-enabled tablet, mobile phone, laptop or other mobile device.


..

6006840060008 Slingbox has been around a little longer but Belkin did exactly what they was supposed to do which was under cut the competition with out sacrificing quality. If they come out with a newer version I can only imagine how much better it could be.

..

6006840060008 I ordered it cautiously not knowing what to expect. It is a rather big box for its function, but I set it up physically using the quick start guide in about 5 min in my guest room on my whole home dvr system (directv). The software installed easily but my 2wire router from AT&T Uverse was difficult to set up the port forwarding on. That took me about 20 min. It works flawlessly now, the quality is quite good from my office computer and at home. Iphone quality is about what you'd expect, a little patchy. Of course, its dependent on the quality of your internet connection.

..

6006840060008 Setup was quick and easy. Everything I needed was included in the box. Got the App for my Galaxy off the Play Store, setup and running. Great for road warriors with hotel and airport time on their hands.

..

6006840060008 Bought this originally because it was cheaper than a Slingbox... All that I ended up doing was having to spend more time with a return.
Set up was not bad...after I spent 30 minutes downloading their incredibly large setup wizard/ player. After that, the quality of the stream was sub par.... I couldn't even figure out which team I was cheering for. They both looked like blurs.... This product still has a long way to come to be anywhere competitive to a Slingbox. Word of warning.... Its a bit cheaper, but don't waste your time. Just go buy a new Slingbox. Light years better than the @TV...

With the same durable construction and thoughtful design details found in all our iPad Air covers, the FreeStyle Case for iPad takes sleek protection to a whole new level. Works with: iPad Air PROTECTION & VIEWING VERSATILITY The FreeStyle Cover iPad Air Case comes with an innovative QuickStand, a front cover that snaps to the back of the case. When opened, you can use it as a stand, and rotate your iPad Air to view content in either portrait or landscape mode. When you want to use the slim case on its own, just detach it and go. SECURE FIT Our FreeStyle iPad Air Cover isn't just about good looks--it also provides reliable protection. Snap your iPad Air into the fitted frame to securely hold it in place and just push down on the corners of the frame when you want to remove it.

The same clasp can be used to hold the cover back and out of the way while you're using your tablet.


..

6006840060008 Very functional while slim and light weight . Also like black

..

6006840060008 I bought this cover for my ipad. It is just what I needed.

..

6006840060008 Bought this right before a trip and wanted some protection for the Air.
Worked great during travel. Also use it for everyday use to prop the Air in either landscape or portrait mode. Very handy.
Only wished that it would automatically put the Air to sleep when the cover is on. Otherwise it would be perfect

..

6006840060008 It is a very nice case. You can easily detach the iPAD from the case via a magnet attachment. You can also swivel it 360 degrees.

..

6006840060008 Overall I'm very happy with this case. I especially like the fact that the cover comes off and back on with a magnet. You can remove the cover and just hold the ipad by itself. The back is protected in a hard shell. The magnet allows you to rotate the ipad and view it both in portrait and landscape positions. It comes off easily but stays securely attached when you want it to.
It is well constructed and does not feel cheap. It does feel light which is a good thing. No point in buying an air but it feels like lead with a weighty case.
One limitation is that it doesn't have the magnets to automatically turn off the iPad. Also, the "low" position seems odd. You have to flip the case the other way to use it. It still works however. The only other feature, I would have enjoyed is an elastic band to slide my hand into.
These last items would make this an "everything" case. The fact that it doesn't have these doesn't take away from what it is.

..

6006840060008 I like this cover because of how thin it is and how lightweight. It also is great for positioning your iPad at different angles. Also has the best fit for the new Ipad Air.

..

6006840060008 the case is protective and serves as a stand--very convenient. the price of $60 I think is high however.

..

6006840060008 Well designed case. Protects and sleek. This was affordable and good value for the price.

..

6006840060008 I like this cover, it was easy to apply and gives good protection to my ipad.

..

6006840060008 Overall a good buy. I exchanged the Targus case I reviewed previously for this one. Only downside is that when deploying the screen for use, it only feels secure and won't slip in two of the six available grooves. Fortunately, the two positions, the one that gives the greatest angle from the horizontal and the one that gives the smallest, are the ones that work best for me. The former is best for viewing and reading and the latter is best for writing emails.

Bring your tablet into the kitchen without cluttering the counter. The Kitchen Cabinet Mount helps keep your tablet in view and securely suspended on any cabinet or shelf.


..

6006840060008 Bought this for my wife and she uses it all the time for viewing recipes while she cooks. Only took a few minutes to setup on a cabinet next to the stove. Wife can view recipes or watch tv while she cooks. is at perfect height for viewing while standing up and is sturdy enough that you don't feel like you are going to knock it off if you press too hard.

..

6006840060008 Great product - only suggestion would be to make it swivel a bit.

..

6006840060008 That's it. Maybe wait for a sale before you buy it, but otherwise this is an easy "Recommend"

..

6006840060008 I have an iPad2 and it does everything I need it to do. It is easily stowed when not in use, holds my iPad securely in place (even with a smart cover), and keeps the iPad off of the counter and away from splattering pots and pans while I'm in the kitchen. Well worth the price - you won't be disappointed!

..

6006840060008 I was looking for a way to view recipes and movies, listen to music, etc. in my kitchen. I wanted to get my tablet up OFF the counter, and I wanted it to be safe and secure. This contraption does it all! I especially like that I can grab the tablet securely with two hands and slide it out. It's much safer than if I had to maneuver it with one hand. It is NOT in the way, and not bad looking. I tend to leave it out all the time except when company is coming.

..

6006840060008 Keeps my iPad handy, but out of the way while cooking. A little bit of a tight fit if I leave the leather iPad case on, but it works. The directions for connecting it to the cabinet probably weren't as clear as they could have been, however it wasn't too hard to figure out.

..

6006840060008 A little shaky but holds my iPad well. Nice product

..

6006840060008 This is perfect for use in my kitchen--my iPad fits securely in the mount and I can stream movies/tv while I'm working. It may have saved me hundreds of dollars in purchasing a tv and having a cable hookup put into my kitchen. Easy to use and an excellent product. I highly recommend.

..

6006840060008 Mounts on and off very easily, and was glad that I could fit my iPad 1 without having to take it out of the Apple iPad case I keep it in. Very convenient.

..

6006840060008 Love this mount. It is very sturdy. I actually use it in my semi and it stays in place going down the road.

This juice extractor features a wide feed tube that allows you to juice a variety of fruit and vegetable sizes. The 600-watt motor delivers efficient juicing power.


..

6006840060008 only thing to be concerned about is the clean up afterwards

..

6006840060008 Overall this product is good value for money. Only thing I didn't like is to remove 5-6 components to clean...

..

6006840060008 this juicer is great as long as you read and follow ALL directions in the manual....it can get clogged if you use the wrong fruit or put in large pieces, but overall it works really well...I use the leftover pulp to make muffins and apple sauce.....

..

6006840060008 I tried it for 2 days and that is all it took to take it back for a refund. Maybe the plunger is not long enough or the blades are not sharp enough, but fruit and vegetables never made all the way through which defeats the purpose of the product.

Bissell CleanView 82H1 Upright Vacuum Cleaner - 12 A - Bagless - Black


..

6006840060008 Light, great suction, great for carpet
Super fast shipping! 1- great vaccum specially for a student (affordable) and great for apartments 2- suction is amazing! I was surprised by the amount of dust that it sucked it 10 sec from my carpet!! I just vaccumed it with a hoover! But still so much dust that this vaccum sucked from it! My roomate was mad at her vaccum (hoover) when she saw mine! The light is my favorite feature then you can see easily even in the dark! Bad side: power cord which is not auto wrapper (i think if they want to add this feature it's gonna cost more, so maybe that's why they came up with a good price for such a great vaccum, so i dont mind

..

6006840060008 I love my new toy better than my KIRBY....which was very expensive...

..

6006840060008 this is a great item it gets the job done and i dont get frustired going over the same area over and over again cause it didnt pick somehting up

..

6006840060008 I am very pleased with this vacuum. It works great and is a great deal for the money. I highly recommend it!

..

6006840060008 When I found out Dyson vacuums are non-refundable that propelled me in another direction when I was searching for a new vacuum. I needed a good performing unit and wanted a lot of suction. My budget was a fairly healthy one but to my surprise I settled on the Bissell Cleanview Helix, a favorably low priced model.
Not all the reviews were favorable mostly due to the fact that the filters can clog with dust and debri quite easily. That meant one thing to me...good suction. Keeping this in mind I purchased an extra set of filters because with this vacuum the filters can be washed. So about every 3rd use I wash the filters and switch them with the set of clean, dry filters. This has kept the vacuum in tip top shape.
The vacuum is a lighter weight for it's class so I can go up and down the stairs more readily than with some of the others, which is good because I am disabled. I like the attachment for the staircase however the hose could be a bit longer for more ease of use.
So if you are willing to really go the extra step to maintain this vacuum I think it will prove to be a good buy, if you do not wish to do so, then I would not recommend this unit to you. I am, however, quite happy with it because I knew up front what I was getting into.

..

6006840060008 Got this vacuum to replace a stick vacuum as my girlfriends long-haired cat put that poor thing to death dealing with the fur. This vacuum is doing a great job of picking up the extra fluff that floats around the house.
First it has good adjustments. I have mostly bare floors with some carpet and rugs about. I can adjust as I hit different areas of the house.
Its pretty easy to pick up and move around. Seems to still be pretty solid though.
Cleaning the bag less system is pretty easy. Dump it out every so often, and wash it out every other dump. This might need to happen more often for those of you with carpets.
The little attachment just doesn't cut it for me. It doesn't pick up very well in the instances I've tried to use it. So I mostly just avoid using it now. However, having the hose that you can pull out to get to tight spots works well.
Overall, a good vacuum. I think it'll last me a while.

..

6006840060008 THE VACUUM CLEANER IS GOOD, but need improvement on the suction part.

..

6006840060008 This is a great deal for the price! I would highly recommend this to anyone. I have a large family with lots of kids, so I am always vacuuming. This takes the "work" out of the job. I Love this vacuum.

..

6006840060008 we had bought a different vacuum at best buy. one of the more poular brands.. we were very disapointed with it and returned it for this one. this one was less money and when we cleaned over the area we had previously cleaned with the other, we got more dirt and animal hair out.
Two other people where i work purchased this vacuum and are extremly satisfied. they are pet owners also

Keep your pet cool and your house clean with this pet grooming tool that helps remove loose hair from your pet. The hose bends and swivels, so you can move around your pet with ease.


..

6006840060008 My beagle loves to be brushed. This just takes the hassle out of having to clean up afterwards or brushing her outside. She wasn't ever really scared of the vacuum cleaner, but avoided it. I put the vacuum behind me and reach the hose to my front. She lays there and loves it! It picks up A LOT of the hair.

..

6006840060008 A great idea and not too pricey. However, if your dogs need a real brushing, which is when the bulk of the fur really flies, this brush head will not do the trick. With a different brush head this would be great, but as it is it is useless to us and the amount of fur I brush out of my dogs regularly.

..

6006840060008 What a waste of money, I should have returned it but waited too long. I would not recommend this product to anyone. I could find alot of things that I could spend $70 on. This thing was'nt worth $5. The tank keeps falling off and it also leaks all the time. It soaks the floor and leaves residue marks everywhere. Also there it doesnt stand upright on its own, if you have to stop mopping for a minute you have to lean it on the wall or something, otherwise it falls over..WARNING....DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT !!!!!

..

6006840060008 I bought this to use on wood laminate floors. I thought it would be just the thing to sweep and mop more quickly. I failed that litmus test. It is very heavy and has no power. The mopping feature is you constantly pushing the lever that squirts out hot water. It's a joke. I paid full price for it which was almost $100 . What a disappointment. I would take it back, but I was so sure it was going to be a good investment, I threw away the box and don't have the receipt.

..

6006840060008 Bought it and returned it the next day. The tank kept on falling off and it was leaking all over.

..

6006840060008 My first mop did not steam. The second mop had steam when the pad was off. When the steam hit the pad it cooled it back to water and left puddles on my new hard wood floor. I went out and bought a Shark. It steams like advertised.

..

6006840060008 my husband is a diabetic and I have to clean my ceramic floors daily, this little mop made my life so much easier Thanks Bissell

..

6006840060008 I was hesitant at first about mopping with no cleaners. Wondering just how clean can my floors get without soap. After mopping my hardwood and vinyl floors, now I'm convinced. It does work. After mopping my hardwood floor, I saw streaks being left behind. But, I soon realized it was all the leftover chemicals being dissolved and brought up from previous cleaners (ie. Swiffer Wet Jet). I continued using once a week and BAM! no more streaks. Another word of caution, do not be so trigger happy. That will cause streaking. Floors dried instantly. (Something you worry about on hardwood). It saves money. Just wash and hang dry the mop covers. You may want to buy distilled water to use in it, as I have hard water. This will prolong filter life. The attached water bottle will last a very long time. A full tank last me 3 weeks and I mop six rooms with it every week. I wish the cord was a little longer, as I have to find closer plugs to finish mopping. But, not a big deal. It stays hot and ready.

..

6006840060008 I am not at all happy with this product. It is very hard to maneuver and leaves the floor dripping wet - worse than a mop.

..

6006840060008 It cleans great and it is easy to use. It warms up fast and the steam is visable as you use it. The floor looks cleaner after I done.

..

6006840060008 I would not recommend this mop. The only way to get your floors clean is on your hands and knees with a bucket, water with a cleaning solution in it and a rag. This mop only smeared the dirt around.

Push-button control panel with digital display; 1-touch operation for popular foods and functions
Adjustable time and temperature; convection fan for even heating; fits a 12-inch pizza
See-through glass door; slide-out crumb tray; baking pan and rotisserie spit/forks included
Measures approximately 13-4/5 by 21-4/5 by 16-1/2 inches; 1-year limited warranty


..

6006840060008 Had it for about 6 months and it's great!! Heats up fast and does a better job cooking evenly then my oven does!!

..

6006840060008 It performs decently but you can't change the temp or timer on some settings until it preheats. It is as big as a microwave! I didn't check the dimensions because it's a toaster oven. I haven't cooked a pizza in it yet, but I'm sure it would turn out just fine. My biggest complaints are its size and the inability to choose your own setting.

..

6006840060008 This is an easy oven to use and heats up quickly. It is easy to clean and looks good in our kitchen. I would recommend to others. This is a nice oven for the price.

..

6006840060008 I ordered online from BestBuy.com and it arrived very promptly. I love the digital timer and settings. In the past I've had knobs that would break or get loose. I can put my food in, set the temp, set the time and forget about it. It notifies me when it's ready and shuts itself off if I can't get to it immediately. So far I haven't found anything that was too large for it to handle.

..

6006840060008 I'm sure the convection and the toaster over works great, but my mistake was buying this product for the rotisserie! The first one I bought just stopped working after only a few months, so I returned it for a new one. Now the problem I have with this second one the rotisserie spit/forks and skewer that inserts into your meat are completely rusted over. I can not use it at all for that reason and have the fun of returning this product again.

..

6006840060008 My family of 5 us getting a lot of use out of this toaster oven from pizzas, to rotisserie pork roast, chicken strips, broiling brats etc. It does a great job. My only complaint would be it takes quite a while to toast bread/bagels. It is very easy to clean and keep clean.

..

6006840060008 I wanted to buy a new toaster oven. I came here to Bestbuy and read a bunch of reviews. This one seemed to be highly recommended on most reviews.
So I purchased this one. It's been great. It has many preset buttons for cooking regular items, ie toast, pizza etc. They can be adjusted depending on say, how dark you want your toast to be. Then that is the preset setting. I highly recommend it. Let expensive than a lot of the others also.

..

6006840060008 I purchased this to save on using the oven for energy conservation, but it uses more energy than my oven. It is probably because it does not seal at all, also really heats up the ikitchen.
For the price, I am very disappointed. I could have bought a cheaper model and probably been just as satisfied.

..

6006840060008 great oven and toaster easy to use. especiallly like the rotisserie feature. have nothing negative about this product. cooks everything evenly fits a 12 inch pizza with ease. easy to clean.

..

6006840060008 This is a great toaster oven. I have only had it a week, but so far really good. The built in preset for Pizza, cookies, and frozen snacks work well. If I had one complaint it would be that the default timer for the presets are a little long, but they are easily changable, so it becomes a none issue. Oven heats fast and the fan helps cook evenly.
It toasts bread great! Has different levels of darkness and they are spot on!
Looked at other cheaper models but, they just didn't have the features, or weren't big enough. Glad I spent a little more to get this.
Highly recommend this appliance.

When we think of the benefits of using our BISTRO Blender Stick, three things immediately come to mind; it's easy and fun to work with, it helps make nutritious foods, and it's easy to clean. It comes with three easy stick-on attachments: the knife for making anything from mouthwatering smoothies on ice to steamy creamy vegetable soups; the whisk for making fabulously airy mashed potatoes; and the beater for making thick milk foam, whipped cream or for beating eggs. It also comes with a beaker for pureing and storing leftovers in the fridge when it's topped of with the lid. The BISTRO Blender Stick is great for baby food, too, by the way. It will become your number one can't-live-without kitchen tool in no time. Just stick it into any pan, pot, glass or bowl and it will do its job effortlessly at push of a button. Once you're done, simply let it run in a bowl of hot water for a bit and it cleans itself. The 2-speed BISTRO Blender Stick is made from plastic and stainless steel.

Monitor your activity and calories burned like contestants on The Biggest Loser with this BodyMedia FIT LINK 100768 armband that delivers real-time feedback to help you achieve your fitness goals. Multivariable tracking ensures accurate readings.


..

6006840060008 I love the link. I've used different monitors and this one has been the best so far. The app is straighforward and easy to use. The only things that were a pain was getting used to the spot to wear it and the bluetooth; just my little annoyances. It's a cool way to keep track and motivate yourself. Ifyou're really on a mission, I definitely recommend. Don't waste your money if you're only going to use it for a week.

..

6006840060008 I owned a similar product before and lost it. it helped me with my fitness goals quite a bit. when I got active again I felt I had to have one of these,

..

6006840060008 In January 2014 my workout partner and I purchased the Bodymedia Fit Core Arm Bands. For me it was because I needed to know my daily burn from midnight to midnight in order to help break my 220 plateau. That plateau was broke the first full week I used the arm band because I was able to see exactly (or a accurate estimate) of my calorie deficit based on my calorie goal, food intake, and physical activity.
Based on Feb 1 - Feb 7 Food Consumed and Actual Burn estimates given by the body media arm band monitor, my daily deficit was as follows:
Feb 1: 791
Feb 2: 1168
Feb 3: 1211
Feb 4: 851
Feb 5: 929
Feb 6: 1700
Feb 7: 961
Total weekly deficit was 7611 then divided by 3500 (lb) = 2.2 (lbs loss estimate) I lost 2 lbs that week (solid). The monitor does report accurate estimates of actual burn based on 5000 body readings a minute 23 hours a day. Measuring body temp, perspiration, movement, and from the videos I've watched the device reads the body like it were a computer. (pretty amazing) (thanks IBM)
My deficit was higher some days not because I did not eat (i eat believe me) but because I was more active and always aware of my activity level via online activity manager and app for my smart phone.
The device has come down in price as well as the subscription fee. For less than 7 dollars a month (after 3 month free) I have access to my actual burn, activity level, sleep quantity & quality, deficit (based on food entry), and I can view my actual burn live while I work out. The band and device are sturdy, sweat resistant, built for torture. Ever evolving with firmware updates. (if I can pay 15 bucks a month to play a video game online or pay to watch movies every month online) I was sure as hell going to be the 7 bucks to see what the hell was up with my body. (to be blunt)
If your stuck in a plateau or need help loosing weight/managing your weight once and for all and don't want to have to go through 3 years of trial and error like I did, try it and you will see for yourself.
I'm new to youtube so if you want to see my lame videos: Check out my youtube unboxing and bodymedia fit arm band progress videos. http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuWwAuFhOFqLTqHbPEtWsnw

..

6006840060008 Great device but all that is missing is heart rate view

..

6006840060008 like that it tracks steps and.calories. wearing it is like its not even on, doesn't get in the way

..

6006840060008 This is a great activity tracker. It's pretty accurate and I really liked the app interface. The bluetooth function helps a ton, and i use it every day!

..

6006840060008 This product is great for calorie counting and weight loss. Definitely worth the cost.

..

6006840060008 Awesome, very easy to setup...I have lost 20 since I purchased the equipment, which was 2 months ago

..

6006840060008 The more you wear this device, the more accurate it is and acclimates to your body. I generally wear mine all day everyday except for the shower. Really doesn't bother me. Just make sure to wipe it off after a good work out because the sweat can make it feel sticky. I compared every tracking device (fit bit, polar, basis and more) before purchasing and I am extremely pleased. The link fir band also has blue tooth capabilities so if you have a smart phone it's the one you want! Easy read out and user friendly.
It is easy to wear but I do wish it was a little more attractive, maybe an all black design would look cool. If only if only :)

..

6006840060008 Everything works fine except downloading the firmware. Returned one device but new one does the same thing. I will have to call tech support.

Wirelessly stream the music on your Apple iPod, iPhone or iPad with this Boston Acoustics MC200Air speaker system that features AirPlay audio technology, so you can easily enjoy your favorite tunes. BassTrac circuitry provides deep, robust sound.


..

6006840060008 Great sound system for ipads and ipohones. Played holiday music all season long, sounded great.

..

6006840060008 Connects with our apple devices through Airplay to play music throughout the whole house. Sounds great. Great price.

..

6006840060008 We got this to use in the exercise room for the tv but discovered the tv was too old to hook up to it. we now use it for on the porch hooked to the iPod. The sound is just amazing my brother even said it almost sounded like a Bose.

..

6006840060008 Was looking for a wireless speaker for my deck and saw this $199 speaker on sale for $49.99. It was a great purchase. The speaker has excellent sound and was very easy to connect to my iPhone and iPad. I would highly recommend this product.

..

6006840060008 I bought this on a whim without having listened to it and I am highly impressed with Boston Acoustics on this one.
Despite this being a wireless connection, the sound comes through crisp and clear for high, mids, and lows. Although it doesn't reach the lowest of the human spectrum of hearing, it still has a very good bass kick. The range covers my entire apartment which is about 1000 square feet so I can move around with my iPod and control the sound from wherever.
I tested out a lot of different kinds of music and the only thing that did not play as well was Hip Hop and that being because the range of the product only gets down to 70 hz as opposed to 20 hz being the bottom of the human hearing range. I still got a decent bass kick and was able to make out the entire spectrum of everything.
The only thing about this product that was slightly frustrating was the set-up but once I figured it out that was not even that bad.
For design, sound, range, and ease of set-up I easily give this product 5 stars. (It even has an aux port for those who don't like the OS operating system for their devices).

..

6006840060008 Bought this as a single purpose audio player. The ability to stream from iPhone 5 to player works well and the sound output is large. Fidelity is better than good however the unit has no individual controls for bass or treble, this is a slight drawback when wanting to listen in the evening with a reduced bass response so not to bother others in the house.

..

6006840060008 Good product for the money. Would definitely recommend for spare room, bedroom, etc.

..

6006840060008 I'm not a a big Bose fan so I was trying to find an alternative. I stumbled across this on Beatweek Magazine. This speaker has a beatiful design, SOUNDS amazing and the setup is very easy. The sleep function is great since it wakes almost instantly and it's easy to send music from an Apple product...iphone, iPad or iMac . Very please with the purchase and glass I took the chance. As another reviewer stated I'm very surprised Best Buy would not display this unit in their stores!!!!! In the end this is an excellent choice and I may purchase another unit for a different room in my house.

..

6006840060008 I saw the Boston Acoustics MC 200 Air a while ago, and really found the design stunning. It does not look like the old toasterific/microwave-safe design from their old radio/iPod dock system. This is a beautifully designed speaker with Airplay, Bluetooth, and AUX inputs. We use it in a room with our home gym, so we can either stream music via Pandora through Bluetooth or through the AUX jack on the side to listen to the news while working out.
I am surprised that this isn't in any Best Buy stores, I found this product online after reading a review from the Boston facebook page.
Keep up the great work, Boston. With great-sounding products like this, you are going to put yourselves back on the map very quickly.

..

6006840060008 A good starter speaker for a kids room or school dorm.

..

6006840060008 I was having a lot of difficuly hearing my TV. The sound bar was not expensive and greatly enhanced the sound of my TV, but I would prefer that the sound could be more easily adjusted.

..

6006840060008 I was trying to save money and bought this on sale. If I knew that it was going to work when it wanted to and not when I wanted it to, I would have spent a little more and gotten something that worked better with my TV and my TV remote.
Poor instructions and just does not work like it should.

..

6006840060008 When the sound bar worked, the sound was good. Unfortunately, either I had a defective product or the hook-up cables suppied were faulty. The soundbar would just shut off on it's own after about 1 hour of using. Programming the remote was terrible -- so many steps and then it didn't work. Would not recommend this product

..

6006840060008 We mentioned in the store that the sound out of TV's cannot be heard as well as we thought. We have never had a soundbar and when we bought the soundbar and plugged it in, it was like a new world opened up to us. We have had so much enjoyment out of our new Vizio TV and soundbar combination.

..

6006840060008 This sound bar is ok. It does the job of enhancing the sound of our television. It is not as good as the ones that have an additional subwoofer, but if you have limited space, it does the job.

..

6006840060008 Ok sound bar but I would of wanted to spend a little more for better sound.Sometimes I get double voices...sounds like an echo..Learned my remote for volume up but not down..OK for now.I got it on sale so I won't complain.

..

6006840060008 This is a great product for a smaller area, system. The only problem we had was getting it to work with the universal remote. It works fine with the television remote though.

..

6006840060008 Great buy for a small room, under $200. Easy to install.

..

6006840060008 Attractive unit. If one likes lots of bass, it's wonderful. Unvortunately, the bass drives me nuts.

..

With the improved triple action free float system, increased motor speed and new SensoFoil, the new Series 3 not only delivers even better shaving performance on 3-day beards, but is also incredibly smooth on skin. 


..

6006840060008 This shaver has performed great over the last year. It delivers a close shave and is easy to maintain. The battery really holds a long charge compared to a trimmer that I have which usually dies after one use. I honestly have no complaints with the Braun Solo. Worth the money.

..

6006840060008 I have always used Norelco electric but changed to Braun . good product and good price. Does the job well and provides a close shave and feel like a wet shave.

..

6006840060008 Good value for money, works well, easy to clean, dual use

..

6006840060008 The Braun razor works great but for the price I would have expected a better charger cable and a case or cover for travel.

..

6006840060008 works great...after first charge went over three weeks before needing charged again!!

..

6006840060008 After reading others reviews I gave this a try and have not been disappointed. It cuts multiple day growth much better then the Norelco rotary I had been using. It seems to hold a charge longer then my rotary (or maybe it just gets the job done quicker).
Additionally, I feel it is easier to clean. I think the rotary motion does something to the stubble in the razor that makes it "stick" more to the blades and mechanism.
Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and will probably purchase a similar model when the time comes to replace it.

..

6006840060008 It's perfect. Have been using Braun for a while now and it has never disappointed me.

..

6006840060008 JUST BECAUSE IT'S NOT WET AND DRY DOESN'T MEAN IT WON'T GIVE YOU A GOOD SHAVE. IT'S A GOOD BANG FOR YOUR BUCK.

..

6006840060008 Great updated product from Braun. Strong, durable, and great shave.

..

6006840060008 Gave this as a gift for my brother. He's pleased that it's easy use and it does not give him a razor burn as manual shaving does. Easily charges, my brother does. It give this product any negative review.

..

6006840060008 blends great - cleans up great - quiet - nuff said

..

6006840060008 If you had asked me yesterday was I glad I chose the Breville over more expensive blenders, I'd have said yes without hesitation. I use it daily - many days 2 or more times. I make my own nut butters, smoothies (it liquifies greens perfectly), hummus, and even black bean truffles without a problem. The overload protection is a nice feature, as it's easy to let it run while doing other kitchen tasks - it shuts off after a minute of processing. It cleans up in a snap too. For less than 1/2 the price of the Vitamix, I have been thrilled. Until tonight when I plugged it in and it wouldn't turn on. After 8 months of use it's dead for no reason that I can see. Yes, it's still under warranty and we'll see what happens when I call them tomorrow. According to the warranty info on the site I may get a new or refurbished one in 14 days. That's just too long for me to go without a blender after spending $200 on one less than a year ago.

..

6006840060008 The automated ice crushing cycle created great crushed ice.
The bowl is made of a very sturdy material, both impact resistant, and dishwasher safe. Compare to Vitamix at half the price. Just the best blender I've ever purchsed.

..

6006840060008 While this is a great unit, it cost more than i am used to spending on blenders. It is great for doing smoothies (this is it primary use in my house)

..

6006840060008 I bought this to help prepare my husband's liquid diet. (Required after surgery). It is worth every penny. I always bought the cheaper blenders. They were a pain to clean, so I rarely used them. This one is easy to clean. And it does everything I need it to do. Liquefies all sorts of fruits and veggies. Food pours out without lots of it getting caught under the blades. I haven't tried crushing ice yet. That's next.

Enjoy hot coffee every morning with this coffeemaker that brews up to ten 5-oz. cups and features a fast 3-minute cycle so that your coffee always tastes fresh. A ready-to-brew reservoir keeps the water at the ideal brewing temperature.


..

6006840060008 This is our 4th Bunn coffee maker. They are functionally great, but only last a few years. Make sure that you take this into account when you buy one. At $100, they aren't cheap, but they make a really fast pot of coffee and look great. Remember to turn off the coffee maker while on vacation!

..

6006840060008 I love bunn coffee makers I have bought them the past 35 years they make a pot of coffee in three mins and it taste very good also.
I have family members and friends that we so impressed with my bunn that they also have went out and purchased bunn coffee makers.
They used to come with the water pitchers to fill the coffee maker and they do not have that anymore I still have one from about ten years ago that i still use because years ago as so as you put water in it started making coffee now they have the lids so it will not start brewing till you slide or put the lid down but I do not like to use the pot for measuring the water so I still use my old picher.

..

6006840060008 I wanted a good coffee maker, but didn't want to spend too much. This Bunn makes great tasting, smooth, coffee, even when I use cheap stuff. I love the speed at which I can brew a full pot of coffee. less than 4 minutes.

..

6006840060008 We love the fact it only takes 3 minutes to brew. I just had to buy our second coffee maker just like this one its been over 8 years since I bought the first one. All of the friends and families I know have had to replace theirs of the other brands. I'll keep my bunn. ALWAYS

..

6006840060008 I never knew how bitter my coffee was prior to having my Bunn. Taste is night and day, so smooth at the perfect drinking temperature. My only disappointment is that I cannot set a timer to brew in the morning before work, even through it only takes minutes to brew I still like it sitting and waiting for me... However the price and quality is so much better I forget about the extra few minutes it takes me in the morning with every tasty sip.

..

6006840060008 had the same kind before for 7 years. It worked great and kept the coffee hot. This new one does not !!!!!

..

6006840060008 Got for in home use. Brews a full pot of coffee in about 3 minutes. Flavor and quality is excellent however the cost is a bit higher than others. An aspect I didn't know before purchase is that for it to brew fast you must leave the unit on continuously (24/7) to heat the water. So I would only recommend this to someone that drinks coffee routinely. Have not noticed an increase in the electric bill yet. Unit is very nice looking on the counter top with just about any color scheme as it is black and stainless.

..

6006840060008 Best coffee maker ever. I own one, bought 1 for my Dad and this one was a gift. Holds whole pot of hot water, so when you want to make coffee....it brews instantly! No bad side. If you are a big coffee drinker....you need this!

..

6006840060008 I've always liked this style and the white color is so clean. Very dependable and brewing in 3 mins for 10 cups is perfect.

..

6006840060008 Overall it's a great coffe maker. The secret is the hot water always ready and the spray nozzle. I don't think it's going to last as long as our first Bunn coffe maker. That one lasted 5 years. There are also some sharp edges on the back that scrape the counter if your not careful. If you have the Bunn under a upper cabinet , to fill it you must pull it out and then put it back. We really scratched up our solid surface with our last one.
Still, it makes a great cup of coffe

BUNN HG-D Brewer - 8 Cup(s)


..

6006840060008 Only auto drip coffee maker approved by Specialty Coffee Association for under $200 (https://www.scaa.org/?page=cert2). You will notice a difference in your coffee, much smoother cup of joe. The water tank is above the filter basket and heats to the correct temp before showering the grinds, No problems with the pour spout, never missed a drip (see complaint from other review). I gave up on Cuisinart, they only lasted 3 years, tried a calphalon, it lasted 1 week and broke, then tried the fancy Sears model with the grinder (horrible machine) before I found the Bunn. Love this machine, finally a good cup without going to a French press.

..

6006840060008 It's awfully noisy... but makes good coffee when it works... sometimes doesn't cycle the water through and you have to shake it... ALWAYS drips when you pour (from the right or left), the pot and lid design is not very good... I've had other Bunn's, this isn't a good one

BUNN BX Brewer - 900W - 50fl oz - 10 Cup - White


..

6006840060008 would not buy anything else, these last forever. have tried other but don't come close as a bunn

..

6006840060008 Easy setup, solid foundation for stability, produces hot coffee in minutes, warmup period required but this is a necessary downside for a quality result, often difficult to determine how much water is in the reservoir.

..

6006840060008 This Bunn coffee maker is awesome. Good hot and tasteful coffee. It even can brew tea if you'd like. Just buy it. Have it working every day since 1/8/13, no problems at all.

..

6006840060008 
Coffee lovers will enjoy caf quality coffee brewed in 3 minutes with this 10-cup thermal coffeemaker. The patented sprayhead design and an internal thermostat improve coffee flavor extraction for an ideal cup of coffee every time.


..

6006840060008 When looking for a new coffee maker, I knew I wanted this model so I searched the internet. Best Buy, by far, had the best price and I liked the option of picking up at the store so I could choose the time and date. My husband is in charge of making the coffee and he LOVES this model. The coffee is hot, the right hot; the grounds are thoroughly saturated, giving the optimal flavor; it is automatic shutoff so we don't have to worry if the coffee maker is off; the coffee does not sit on a burner - thus, the operative word "burner". We don't have burnt tasting coffee. We LOVE this model. Can you tell?

..

6006840060008 very happy with purchase i turn on my, coffee maker go to bathroom in morning and BAAMMM. fresh coffee

..

6006840060008 Very happy with the coffee maker but the one downfall is the coffee doesn't stay hot long enough.

..

6006840060008 It is too big and the usage for electricity is a lot

..

6006840060008 I love the fact that you don't have to worry about breaking the decanter or leaving it on the burner without enough coffee in it. I also love how long it keeps the coffee hot! This decanter, even without the burner, keeps the coffee steaming hot for a good 2 or even 3 hours.

..

6006840060008 I have found this coffee maker to be great, the new pot doesn't leak and the coffee is hot and stays that way. Have found this maker to be worth every penny...

..

6006840060008 If you like hot coffee, this machine is not for you. If the water starts out at 200 degrees, it does not end up that way by the time it gets into the carafe. The more coffee you place in the filter, the less hot the coffee going into the carafe is. This product is definitely not worth the price. Actually, it's not worth the price even if it was free.

..

6006840060008 Easy to use. Fast coffee in less than 3 minutes as advertised. No hot plate to burn your coffee. No on and off switch except vacation. No worries about leaving the coffee pot on. Simple machine however expensive. I have not been experiencing carafe issues coffee hot after 3 hours in carafe.
No burnt coffee. Con......Not as attractive as other coffee makers and expensive. Only makes 10 cups. But good tasting 10 cups!

..

6006840060008 This coffee maker is awesome. It makes a pot very fast and the carafe does keep the coffee hot for about an hour. Very nice looking machine to have sitting on a counter also.

..

6006840060008 Would not buy any other brand. It is the best. Great price quick delivery. I shopped around for awhile the price was well worth the wait.

..

6006840060008 this is my 2nd bunn coffee maker in 11yrs. i wore my 1st one out.. and the stainless steel pot is great i can make coffee and set it on my table for company or on my desk while m at the pc... love my BUNN!!!

..

6006840060008 They always great coffee makers that last a long time.

..

6006840060008 My husband and I purchased this so that we can have coffee in a moments notice.

..

6006840060008 Throughout my working life in radio doing morning shows, I'm the guy who had to be awake to WAKE YOU UP in the mornings. I was fortunate enough to work at many radio stations that knew the value of having quality hot fresh coffee made very quickly (during commercial breaks) and Bunn was always the brand to trust. Being a coffee snob (which I'm not, but friends think I am) I love the fact that the Bunn is ALWAYS ready to pump a hot pot of water through whatever ground beans I put in the filter, but it saturates them with very hot water getting the most flavor and aroma in the minimal amount of time. NOTHING BEATS A BUNN.
By the way, I had the commercial models when I owned a restaurant. Woudn't ever have another brand on my counter at home or at work!

..

6006840060008 The best coffee maker I've ever owned! Not only does it brew a full pot in 3 minutes, if I'm not using it for a few days, I can turn the heating element off. It's ready in about 10 minutes when I'm ready to brew another pot.

..

6006840060008 Just purchased after discarding my 10th $30 Mr. Coffee drip brew. Everything is just as advertised. Coffee is extremely smooth without any bitterness. I like hot coffee and the advertised brew temp of 200 was appealing to me so I thought I would spend the extra money. Temperature in thermal carafe immediately after brewing was +180. After three hours it was 165. After 12 which you would probably never do it was still over 120. I did follow the instructions and preheated the carafe with hot tap water for a couple of minutes. Was told that these last for 20 years - hope this is the case.

The cbtl americano from the coffee bean and tea leaf. Makes fast, fresh and flavorful espresso, coffee or tea.


..

6006840060008 I am so glad I bought this CBTL machine on a lark swayed by the good reviews and recommendations, and since it could also make espresso. I figured we could make more caf style drinks. And the price was good. After 6 months I can say we are well pleased with the quality of this coffeemaker and continue to enjoy it like the first week we had it. No other machine I know of on the current market makes espresso, coffee, and tea from a capsule so well. It takes up little space yet has a huge water tank. I have given one as a shower gift and another as a Christmas present. They love them as well.

The optical FunMouse is sized just right for your child's little hand with color-coded left and right buttons.

..

6006840060008 Love this for my kids!!!! My kids love it too. In fact, the whole family uses it.

..

6006840060008 I bought this for my kids and they love it!! Every house in America should own one, I am so happy Best Buy is finally offering something for everyone, rather than just the bland, black or white keyboards. The mouse is great too, and small for kid's hands.

..

6006840060008 
The KinderBoard is an excellent first keyboard with large, 1 inch square keys and easy-to-read numbers and letters. Consonants, vowels, numbers and punctuation marks are color-coded to help pre-school children learn their alphabet and identify character sets.


..

6006840060008 I never write reviews, but jsut couldn't resist this time. I have three keyboards at home much like this one called the Kinderboard from Chester Creek. The first two were junk (BigKeys and Caliphone) - quit after a few months or just didnt work like they said. I know, a keyboard is a keyboard, but the Kinderboard is much more. It is built like a tank, the coloring is smart (for teaching my grandchildren both their alphabet and how to type) and the keys are almost 1" so their small fingers can hunt and peck for hours. I love this keyboard. Thanks Best Buy for taking care of grandpa and his grandchildren.

Capture photos and videos of specimens with this Celestron Infiniview 44360 LCD digital microscope, which features a 5.0MP digital camera with 10x magnification, so you can take crisp, detailed shots. The battery-powered design enables on-the-go use.


..

6006840060008 Bought for my husband to use with his coin collection. He looks for finite stamping errors on coins and it was too hard to see things with tradtional hand held magnifiers. This electronic scope lets him look at those finite details easily and he can snap a digital picture of the coin to save or share as needed. This has been worth the investment.

..

6006840060008 Excellent microscope with easy-to-use controls even for a novice. The only thing missing is a movable stage, which would help with slide viewing. Otherwise a great instrument, well-made with solid parts and construction.

Celestron Accessory Kit


..

6006840060008 It took me a LOT of thinking before buying "any eyepiece kit" for my Telescope.
I am completely new in the field (amateur astronomer) so my lack of knowledge probably leads me to "wishing for better image".
I am using it with my Celestron CPC800 and I was expecting to see those amazing close up images, but as you go with more magnification it becomes extremely difficult to focus an object. Jupiter looks spectacular, I easily see up to 5 of its biggest moons with a low magnification eye piece. I can also see the stripes where the "Big red spot" is located. I cannot see the Jovian Rings, but as I read one requires a rather LARGE telescope to be able to see them.
I am uploading a picture of Jupiter. Don't let it mislead you as I don't know yet how to take pictures where you can see what you really see thru the Eyepieces. The picture looks rather "black and white" but thru the eyepieces you can see colors.
Basically, for the price you pay, I believe is a great starting kit. You can grow later as you acquire more knowledge and know which exact eye piece you want.

..

6006840060008 I recently purchased a Celestron Omni XLT 150 and wanted a variety of lenses and filters to use with my new telescope. The kit gave me a variety of lenses with a wide range of options. I was extremely happy with the quality of optics.

..

6006840060008 not a bad set of ep's for the price, but definitely worth the money. perfect for people new to the hobby

..

6006840060008 The included eyepieces with beginner telescopes are very poor quality glass and usually have very little eye relief. These eyepieces have decent eye relief. While there are certainly higher quality eyepieces available, these give you excellent bang for the buck for any sub-$500 telescope, and would suffice for sub-$1000 scopes. The included 2x Barlow is the secret sauce of this package as a good Barlow is 1/3 the cost of this kit. The Celestron 8-24mm zoom lens is an excellent alternative if you only want one eyepiece. You don't get the range of zoom that this kit provides or the clarity of fixed eyepieces, but it is very convenient to have just one eyepiece for casual viewing.

..

6006840060008 This router would have to be reset every time the power went off, it would not reset itself. Sometimes this involved calling Linksys, and dealing with all of those, not so great English speaking people. Linksys tech and customer service, in my opinion, is a 3 on a scale of 1 to 10. This router only lasted 1.5 years before the firmware quit working. I spent hours on the phone with customer service over 1.5 years trying to repair this thing. Finally they said the firmware was bad, and they would give me a $15 rebate. That was one 30 days ago, and I'm still waiting(And calling every two weeks) Do not buy this router, it's not reliable, and not very easy to use for the novice.

..

6006840060008 I have had this router for about a year now and router management has become a nightmare. When I first bought this router you were able to simply log on to it like every other router and manage it by just going to the IP address. I was able to configure it and manage my LAN with no issues. The wifi signal it puts out is reliable and fast and allows me to use the internet for the most part. Ethernet connections are fast, but if you have to many devices connected the entire network can stop working until you unplug a device or two. I have found that 5 devices using LAN or Wifi at the same time can lead to this.
A year later and router management has become impossible. Now you are no longer allowed access to the router by just putting in the IP in a web browser. You must go to a website to manage your router. There is a local access button on the web site, but either way I am unable to log into the router to perform any kind of management on it because it hangs on a loading screen. So much for being able to manage my router or check router settings on my desktop connected to the very router that Im try to manage.
They have apps for android\iphone as well. Sadly both apps are worthless as I can log on to the router, but it says no devices are connected. Never mind that the ipad that the app is running on is connected to the router via wifi and has connected to the router via the app. The one thing I can do is reset the router password for wifi.
I would not recommend this router to anyone because you cannot manage any of the settings on it. This is a shame, because the wifi is pretty reliable. But since you cant even see who has access to your network in settings or change other network settings it is not user friendly. The one setting it seems to be able to do is reset the wifi password if you use the smartphone app. But that assumes your even able to get it to work the first time you hook it up to your LAN.

..

6006840060008 This remains the best Linksys of many I have owned over the years!
Well worth the price. You DO get what you PAY for with Cisco and Linksys 4200!

..

6006840060008 I am very well versed in networking and wireless technology. The claims that are made by the manufacturer are not delivered by the product. The speed is all over the map as in not consistent. It constantly drops the connection. Mine constantly tries to revert to the guest connection when it drops the primary connection. The only time it is even partly reliable is if you are in the same room as the router. Even then, there are connection problems. There needs to be major firmware improvements. I hope the company makes them. I really wouldn't recommend to buy this product at this time. I am very disappointed.

..

6006840060008 Nice extended range...powerful router!
Very useful if you need wireless internet in a large house/office

..

6006840060008 I had been using a WRT54GL v1.1 Linksys router for about 3 years. It is an 802.11g router and has been rock solid since the day I bought it. I expected the same from the e4200v2, as I assumed it would be of the same (Cisco) Linksys quality that I had experienced with my current router. I did some research and read some of the editorial reviews, and believed the e4200v2 to be a top of the line router. I was sadly mistaken.
I am somewhat of a power user, but, I suspect, that most people looking at this router would be since it has a higher price point and feature set. The hardware specification for this router are great (one of the best on the market), but the firmware is so buggy and the GUI so limiting and such a kludge that it cripples the e4200v2's functionality. When connected, I was getting very impressive throughput and range. The physical design is also very sleek, but I would still prefer external antennae.
To begin with, the web GUI interface is horrible. Linksys recommends using the Connect software, but it is even worse and limiting. There is no logout feature in the web GUI, which I believe is a security issue, and some of the advanced settings are hidden (as in, you have to manually type in the address in the browser's address bar to get to them).
The DHCP client table, which I believe is essential for network status monitoring, is not reliable. Sometimes it doesn't list devices that I can verify are connected to the network. It will also list devices that are not currently connected to the network, which would be fine if there were a connected devices list (which it does not have).
Two 802.11g devices I own would not connect to the e4200v2 if any type of wireless security was enabled. The two devices in question connected fine to a friend's 802.11n router, so I thought it may be a setting on the router. I checked online in the forums and talked with Linksys tech support and neither had a solution. Linksys blamed the devices even though they were connecting fine to two other routers (my old g router and my friend's n router). I also have one 802.11n device that would sporadically disconnect and reconnect to the router (was not a range issue, as I was 20 feet line-of-sight from the router and had excellent signal strength when connected).
There are also several features that I believe a router at this price point should have:
1) Connected devices list with signal strength (mentioned above).
2) Bandwidth monitoring and logging.
3) More extensive DDNS service list.
4) Non-hidden advanced wireless settings tab.
5) Site survey feature, so you can see neighboring network channels.
I did not try any of the media or USB features, as I was so frustrated with the other issues I returned it to Best Buy within a week of purchase.
I would have actually considered keeping the e4200v2 if I had some reassurance that Cisco would fix the firmware in a timely manner. However, the router had the latest firmware, version 2.0.36, which according to the Linksys website was released 01/04/12, so it doesn't look like Linksys is too much of a hurry to fix theses issues. Had I done more research before buying, I would have seen people having similar issues on the Linksys forum. The fact that no one from Linksys has responded to any of those discussions on the forum makes me question even more the priority of this flagship product.
In conclusion, I think this router has great potential, but until they fix the firmware issues, I would stay away from this thing unless you have all newer 802.11n devices and don't mind the other limitations that I listed.

6006840060008 Purchased in Aug 2011 and now in June 2012, it no longer works. To be fair, it is used on long road trips at least once a month and also for about an hour a day, five days a week as my son commutes with me to attend day care. It's been used heavily and for the low price, I think getting a year out of it is not bad.

6006840060008 I like it if I am just carrying my Mac Book Pro laptop, but using it for what it was intended, laptop and iPad together, the bag is tight and leaves me feeling insecure about dropping it. There isn't much padding inside the bag. But, it is outstanding in size and carrying.

Imagine, preserve, enhance your digital media


..

6006840060008 I bought this after getting a new computer with Windows 8 because the older Roxio version wasn't supposed to work properly with Windows 8. After using it for a week, I started having the same problems that I had with the older Roxio version. I burn a lot of DVD's and I could get it to work about half of the time until a few days ago when it rendered itself useless. Either it comes up with errors before burning or it burns the disc and then when I put it in to play it, it says that the disc cannot be played. A company that doesn't offer support for their products is a company that everyone should stay away from. They don't even give you a way to try to get in touch with them.

6006840060008 Purchased to mount a 32" tv in the bedroom, it was easy to install between my father and I, had it up within about 30 minutes and its great having the tv on the wall now. No concerns with weight.

..

6006840060008 Everything is worth it for this inexpensive unit but the 15% tilt.If you don't need it to tilt that much,mount it a little bit lower than anticipated,otherwise you will find that it doesn't point down as much as you may want it to.

You probably already know that solid-state drives are fast. With up to 85,000 IOPS and read speeds of up to 555Mb/s, Force Series GT is on another level. There's fast, and then there's fast. Force Series 3 SSDs have even quicker read and write times when they're installed in PCs that use the latest SATA 3 6Gb/s interface.


..

6006840060008 Very Good Upgrade to Sony Laptop!!!!
ExcellentPurchase

..

6006840060008 Purchased this using a gift card from Best Buy, price is a little higher than other retailers. SSD is every bit as fast I as I had hoped! Would order this brand again if I need one!

..

With a 120GB storage capacity, this Corsair Force Series GT internal Serial ATA III solid state drive provides ample space to accommodate your media. Read speeds up to 555MB/sec. and write speeds up to 515MB/sec. offer fast data transfer.


..

6006840060008 Gives me a windows rating of 7.9. Great speed, super easy to install.

..

6006840060008 I've had the Force GT hard drive for about a month and a half now, and I haven't noticed any issues with it thus far. A build-your-own-computer user will find it easy to install, and the performance is obviously better compared to my old Raptor 10000RPM.
I have not completed a benchmark test on the machine, but I have noticed Windows 7 fully loads all services from the push of the power button in about 25-30 seconds. Seeing how much available hard drive space I have now, I probably could have purchased a smaller size since I also have internal data drive (or for those of you who backup your data to the cloud). I primarily use the hard drive for gaming, and I haven't noticed any lag or load time issues before, during, or after gaming sessions.

..

6006840060008 I will buy this Brand again for my next hard drive upgrade.

..

6006840060008 Its a great SSD, seems reliable and I have had no trouble at all with it, its fast and doubles batterly life. The ony thing is that 120 gigabytes might seem enough but if you are using it for your primary Hard Drive and have no other storage drive it wont be enough.

..

6006840060008 This is my third SSD (two are in my tower and this one is for my laptop). I'd previously bought an OCZ Vertex 3 which I love and get 450mbs read/write. I really wanted another of those but didn't have the funds and fretted a great deal over this purchase. I shouldn't have worried. This drive is just as good and just as fast. It was super easy to install and I'm getting 560/510mbs read/write.
Get one.
PS. Installed it into my Asus G75VW gaming laptop.

..

6006840060008 This is the only SSD I have used so I cannot compare to others. Any operation that is disk heavy like booting or moving files is faster. Regular operations like surfing the web there is no difference.
My system boot time went from about 15 seconds to two seconds from hitting the start button to the desktop.
The drive is good for a laptop because it uses less power and is cooler. For a desktop I don't think it will make as much a difference because boot time is the main difference. I doubt it will have much effect on games. And I always use sleep mode any way so that doesn't matter. Also the price for the size on SSDs is still high.

..

6006840060008 mouse is real comfortable, I have more of slender, long hand and this mouse fits perfect... only time the sniper button is a problem is if my hand slides down it a bit.
If you can buy this mouse!!

..

6006840060008 The mouse is great and it changes the experience of playing your FPS completely. Now I can get a lot more head-shots than previously because of the Sniper button.
I got to play in 3 Operative Systems (2 versions of ubuntu and Win 7) and it worked smoothly on all of them!
I love my new mouse!
Totally recommended. (It is my first mouse of this kind)

..

6006840060008 It also has two buttons on the side i dever realized until a few days ago. So yeahl. It works. I recommend it if youre looking for a nice mouse. It is could for playing first person shooter games or whatevs. I also recommend dayz to play ;) its coo.

..

6006840060008 This mouse is great. Excellent control and feel. Aluminum body so you know its tough. The sides have a sort of grippy texture which i like. The dpi toggle buttons can be customized to do other things. The only thing I dont like is that the sniper button is too far forward. Even with a large sized hand, I have to completely wrap my entire hand around the mouse and stretch my thumb to reach the button. Not a huge inconvenience but it is annoying that its not right where i need it to be

..

6006840060008 This is a solid 9.5/10 mouse for me. I have tried lots of mouse like the deathadder, intellimouse, g500, g5, naga, and the xai. I could not find any mouse that I really enjoy until this baby. Side note: The sniper logo on the sniper button got wiped away down to 15% left of the mark just from using it, not sure if it bothers you but it is odd.

..

6006840060008 I just started playing computer games again with the release of Battlefield 3. At first I was using a basic MS optical mouse, then switched to a Razer Deathadder for more sensitivity, and finally ended up switching to the Corsair M60. This thing has helped me go from the bottom of the leaderboard to about 3/4 of the way up and sometimes even First :) The sniper button is key - it drops your DPI to whatever you set it at (mine is at 200 dpi). This allows you to make more headshots from further away due to more accurate scoping. I highly recommend this product... I'm temped to try out the K60 keyboard now. I used the software once to program buttons, and haven't had any issues.

..

6006840060008 Now, let me start by saying that a 5700 DPI mouse for less than $80 is a fantastic buy for anyone with that much money to begin with. Honestly, if you need a mouse this sensitive, there is no reason to spend too much more on something else.
The only REAL complaints I have are that my big hands don't quite fit. It's hard to explain, but basically, in order for my thumb to be in the right position for the buttons, my fingers need to hang over the edge of the left and right buttons. Other than this, all the hardware features are well thought-out and solidly built, and ALL of the buttons can be re-programmed by the software.
SPEAKING OF WHICH! The software, in essence, WAS broken when I first got the mouse (about 1 month before posting). That's not to say that the disk was broken (there was none), it means that it plain didn't work as intended. That said, it didn't, and still doesn't, interfere with virtually anything.
The software now has a public beta version for both the M60 and it's sister the M90 that actually does work, and I am pleased to report that it really does make the mouse a must buy. However, it's not easy to find the new beta software, and the V1 software was SO bad, I can't help but note it in my "compatibility" section.
Overall, if you can get used to it's unique shape, and find the right version of the software online, this might just be the best $70 you ever spend on PC hardware.

..

6006840060008 We purchased this item to place in my 4 year old son's room. It worked great during the night, just like we hoped it would. This week, after just under three weeks of use, the tank cracked and is completely unusable. I contacted the manufacturer, Crane, to let them know what happened and how disappointment I was in the quality of item, especially since it was intended for use by children. The response I got back was simply a link to the replacement parts available for order on their website, with no mention of the actual reason I contacted them. I purchased the replacement tank, as that was my only option, but emailed them back letting them know I was now also disappointed in their level of quality service as well. I also noticed that although you can make purchases on their website, there is no ability to leave reviews. This was definitely a One and Done purchase of a Crane product.

..

6006840060008 I would recommend this product to any parent interested in changing the humidity in a room. It's easy to set up and portable. It's one gallon size takes up some room, but if you already have kids that kind of comes with the commitment. Definitely use distilled water as it will cut down on buildup of scale.

6006840060008 My wife and I brought this, because she's been decorating the house with an oriental theme, and a red dragon would go well with the rest of the decor. We're amazed at how good this humidifier is, and how long it lasts. While I'm away at work during the day, I leave the humidifier in the living room, and put it in the room before going to sleep. I change the water in it once in the morning, leave it at a medium setting, and it doesn't empty out until the next morning! That to me is awesome!
My wife and I are used to a more tropical weather, so we've been cranking up the heat in the winter, and needless to say, we've both been sleeping way better with the humidifier.

..

6006840060008 Did what it's supposed to do. It is easy to maintain.

..

6006840060008 The humidifier was very easy to put together and fill. Is very easy to use. One "fill" can last over 10 hours (I've never tried to let it fully run out, though).

..

6006840060008 Very good item. It's easy to clean and to take parts apart. The cool mist helps me and my wife sleep better during the nightime.

..

6006840060008 Bought fir my sons nursery and works great, we love it!!

..

6006840060008 Works good but the mist looks the same no matter where I set the adjustment knob. Only way to get the mist low is to turn the knob slowly till it just starts to produce mist. Otherwise the mist doesn't seem to adjust. Does produce white coating on furniture with my tap water, had to use filtered water. Make sure to empty/wipe daily, it gets slimy quickly.

..

6006840060008 Since I have been using this humidifier, I no longer have the dry mouth symptoms. It is quiet, and once I fill it with water, it lasts the whole night. Well worth the $50.

..

6006840060008 I've returned this humidifier to best buy to get a new one 3 times. They would spontaneously stop working. I give up. I am currently looking for one that can last more than a year

..

6006840060008 I have had the humidifier running on low for the past three days and only topped off the tank once. I have not tried on a higher setting to see how fast it runs out. As soon as you put the tank of water on and crank up the setting, it starts to work.

..

6006840060008 I was having nosebleeds from the dry, warm air in our apartment during the winter. My doctor told me to get a humidifier to use. After doing research on the internet I found out that our local Best Buy had this one in stock. It has helped tremendously and is very reasonably priced. There is a re-filling and also a weekly cleaning routine to follow, but I am very pleased with my purchase.

6006840060008 Great product. I've had a few humidifiers and this is my favorite. Very quiet,don't hear it running. no messy filters to clean or replace.

Otherwise the mist doesn't seem to adjust. Does produce white coating on furniture with my tap water, had to use filtered water. Make sure to empty/wipe daily, it gets slimy quickly.

..

6006840060008 Since I have been using this humidifier, I no longer have the dry mouth symptoms. It is quiet, and once I fill it with water, it lasts the whole night. Well worth the $50.

..

6006840060008 I've returned this humidifier to best buy to get a new one 3 times. They would spontaneously stop working. I give up. I am currently looking for one that can last more than a year

..

6006840060008 I have had the humidifier running on low for the past three days and only topped off the tank once. I have not tried on a higher setting to see how fast it runs out. As soon as you put the tank of water on and crank up the setting, it starts to work.

..

6006840060008 I was having nosebleeds from the dry, warm air in our apartment during the winter. My doctor told me to get a humidifier to use. After doing research on the internet I found out that our local Best Buy had this one in stock. It has helped tremendously and is very reasonably priced. There is a re-filling and also a weekly cleaning routine to follow, but I am very pleased with my purchase.

..

6006840060008 Great product. I've had a few humidifiers and this is my favorite. Very quiet,don't hear it running. no messy filters to clean or replace.

Keep cool with this Crane EE-5607 oscillating tower fan, which features 3 speeds for customizable settings and a multifunction control panel that helps simplify operation. The included remote allows you to control the fan from a distance.


..

6006840060008 Looks great in the pic, but in person craftsman ship and materials feel very cheap. PIcture makes it look as if its entirely covered in stainless steel when it actually is only one slab covering about 1/3 of the tower. But worst of all the highest setting for the fan is barely a wavering blow not strong enough to blow out a candle. Returning at my earliest convenience.

Crane Owl Cool Mist Humidifier - Cool Mist, Ultrasonic - 1 gal - 2.10 gal/Day - 250 Sq. ft.


..

6006840060008 We purchased this Item for our 2yr old daughter. It was unfortunate we woke up to soaking carpet and furniture. Even after moving it to 3 different locations and all 3 times soaking carpet.
So, we returned it.
BTW: No ceiling fan were on during the time it was being used.

..

6006840060008 Inexpensive, works well, cute. What else needs to be said?

..

6006840060008 this was perfect for my granddaughters owl decorated room. she is too young to use medications for allergies and sinus so a cool mist humitifier is a life saver to sleep soundly.

Crane POLAR BEAR Cool Mist Humidifier - Cool Mist, Ultrasonic - 1 gal - 2.10 gal/Day - 250 Sq. ft. - 32 W


..

6006840060008 nice design, looks good in the kid's room. humidifies the air as described in the product listing. why don't they make reservoirs that fill themselves? :)

..

6006840060008 My kids are loving it because of frog character. It does good job for kids small room

..

6006840060008 It is easy to clean and operate.
No noise when operating

..

6006840060008 We purchased this item to place in my 4 year old son's room. It worked great during the night, just like we hoped it would. This week, after just under three weeks of use, the tank cracked and is completely unusable. I contacted the manufacturer, Crane, to let them know what happened and how disappointment I was in the quality of item, especially since it was intended for use by children. The response I got back was simply a link to the replacement parts available for order on their website, with no mention of the actual reason I contacted them. I purchased the replacement tank, as that was my only option, but emailed them back letting them know I was now also disappointed in their level of quality service as well. I also noticed that although you can make purchases on their website, there is no ability to leave reviews. This was definitely a One and Done purchase of a Crane product.

..

6006840060008 I would recommend this product to any parent interested in changing the humidity in a room. It's easy to set up and portable. It's one gallon size takes up some room, but if you already have kids that kind of comes with the commitment. Definitely use distilled water as it will cut down on buildup of scale.

..

6006840060008 This humidifier works really well. I would recommend it.

..

6006840060008 Really cute. Kids love it.
Does its job for one small room
Satisfied with this product

..

6006840060008 I would recommend this product to anyone with kids or without works great!

..

6006840060008 I bought this for my cousin who was expecting her first baby. Their nursery theme is elephants. They love this product. It is perfect for their new bundle of joy. Light weight, reasonable size, and great price.

..

6006840060008 My wife and I brought this, because she's been decorating the house with an oriental theme, and a red dragon would go well with the rest of the decor. We're amazed at how good this humidifier is, and how long it lasts. While I'm away at work during the day, I leave the humidifier in the living room, and put it in the room before going to sleep. I change the water in it once in the morning, leave it at a medium setting, and it doesn't empty out until the next morning! That to me is awesome!
My wife and I are used to a more tropical weather, so we've been cranking up the heat in the winter, and needless to say, we've both been sleeping way better with the humidifier.

The Creative D100 is a modern day boombox which delivers wireless audio from any of your Bluetooth-enabled wireless devices. It opens a whole world of possibilities unbound by wires and blends harmoniously into any environment, be it music sharing at the skate park or impromptu partying at the beach. You can even listen to music from non-wireless MP3 players via the integrated AUX-in port.


..

6006840060008 Two things: first, this speaker needs to be plugged in to an outlet, so the speaker itself is not too "portable". It's for people like me, who want the SOURCE (like my tablet) to be portable. Second, I've gotten one in the store on sale for 35 dollars and one for 50 at regular price, so buy it in the store instead of online.
Anyhow, I keep the speaker in my kitchen (somewhat central in my house) and it rocks. Great sound, I believe two 3" drivers and ported. Easy to hook up.
I'd recommend this product enough that I've bought it twice- one for my wife and one for Father's Day for my Dad.

..

6006840060008 I was searching for an iPad dock but nothing really stood out, so I started looking for bluetooth options for speakers. Using bluetooth technology, this can connect not only to my iPad but also to my phone, iPod touch and laptop. The sound it fantastic, of course I don't expect THX theater quality, but it is loud and clear enough for my bedroom and the occasional outdoor party. It can run on batteries, so portability is great. Also, it looks great!

6006840060008 Creative really did it. I purchased this card same day I took it back. When you talk on the microphone there is delay echo therefore you can not say a word because it confuses the person...And creative does not have answer for it.. Stay away from this product

6006840060008 Sound like 1970's quality, very low sound. No regular electric power cable, USB power only. I can't setup the wireless speaker far away from power source. It doesn't make sense to buy this product. I don't want anyone to get the same mistake I did. I rate this product 1 star generously. I returned it next day.

The Crock-Pot Cook & Carry Slow Cooker is an easier way to take your slow cooked meal on the road. The easy locking lid with rubber gasket will help you get to your final destination without making a mess. Features removable dishware safe stoneware, 6 quart capacity and stainless steel finish to compliment any decor.


..

6006840060008 I love this crockpot. It is a perfect starter for a new kitchen or small family. The suction/lock down kid makes it ideal for transportation to parties, events, or back to the refrigerator.

..

6006840060008 I have wanted one for a long time so when Best Buy decided to offer it for $19.99 I jumped at it. This Crock Pot is easy to set up, (not much to do), easy to use, and seems to be very durable. It is worth it getting one.

..

6006840060008 I love cooking now with this crock pot. I am new to using crock pots and did not enjoy cooking until now!

..

6006840060008 This is a great slow cooker and was priced at a bargin.

..

6006840060008 We use the crockpot at least once a week. It has made countless gallons of soups and chili. Has yet to have dinner ready ok time. It's the perfect size to complement any kitchen or chef no latter the experience level. Highly recommended

..

6006840060008 I bought this crock pot online and had broken the glass insert.Went online to find a replacement insert and found for just a few dollars more I could buy another new one, so I bought it .while waiting for the shipment to arrive Wal-Mart ran a sale on one that was a 7 quart ,this one was a 6 quart for less money same brand .Knowing best buy price match guild line wouldn't match the price I bought it from Wal-mart .this is a great crock pot

..

6006840060008 I have had my crockpot for less then two months. It was very easy to use. Recently the bowl crackec and I will be retudning it. I would have never thought that would happen so easily, but luckily I purchased a replacement plan.

..

6006840060008 Great buy for the price! Heats up pretty quickly. Easy to use.

..

6006840060008 Our old Rival 6qt Crockpot met its demise after falling off the counter and making an abrupt landing on the kitchen floor. The controller knob snapped off. It was more than 20 years old. This new one is oval and holds 6qts. No bells and whistles, just a basic high-low-off crockpot. It does a better job with whole chickens, turkey breasts and vegetables than our old round one. Feeds 6 easy, with a few leftovers for lunch the next day. I'm looking forward to many years of use.

..

6006840060008 This slow cooker is great for everything: chili, barbecue, roasts, etc. It's easy to clean and was on clearance at my local best buy.

..

6006840060008 
Slow cooking in your Crock-Pot Slow Cooker provides you the flexibility to prepare a meal early and then have it cook all day. You can carry out your full day's activities and still enjoy a nutritious, home-cooked meal in the evening. It's a healthier, more cost-efficient and convenient way to serve tasty, satisfying meals. This modern, stylish slow cooker with flat digital panel uses programmable cook settings on HIGH with 4 or 6-hour selections and LOW with 8 or 10-hour selections to conveniently cook around your schedule. After cooking time is complete, the Smart-Pot Slow Cooker will automatically shift to WARM setting to keep food at ideal serving temperature.


..

6006840060008 The way it was worded, it gives you the impression that you could change cooking temperatures during the cooking process. Like set on high for 2 hours and then have it go to low for 4 hours. After cooking time, then it goes to warm.
It will not do this. Or we cannot figure out how. Very disappointing. I was excited, as I like to start all my slow cooking on high and then down to low to finish it up. I thought what a handy way to have it do it on it's own. Only reason I bought this.

Crucial Adrenaline 50 GB 3.5" Internal Solid State Drive - SATA


..

6006840060008 I was a bit worried after reading reviews from other sites on this product but I was pleasantly suprised when the setup and installation went so easily. My home built over clocked quad-core loads windows and everything else at least four times faster than before. The SSD installs just like any other hard drive and my machine recoginized it right away. I went to the crucial.com website, entered my code, downloaded the software and rebooted. The second time I booted it went from the log in screen to completely loading my home screen with everything on it within 30 seconds. This product works exactly as advertised.

Whip up delicious dishes easily with this Cuisinart Advantage 5511-BK cookware set that features 11 pieces, including saucepans, skillet and more. The aluminum core ensures even heating, while the nonstick finish provides easy food release.


..

6006840060008 it's just a great set. the interior has a nice nonstick coating. the lids fit nice and i love the heat resistant handles..

..

6006840060008 I had earlier purchases of Cuisinart, but this one i like the most. good nonstick reliability

..

6006840060008 i enjoy cooking with this set, non stick is great.

..

6006840060008 Im in love with my new cookware set ....They are all I use now...

..

6006840060008 i bougt this item on christmas sale and i think it was a good deal.

..

6006840060008 I am very glad I bought this set. The color is wonderful, and the quality is very high! Quality non stick cookware.

..

6006840060008 Cuisinart is a well known name so I expected this cookware set to be of good quality, really be non-stick, and be visually appealing. And I got exactly what I bargained for. The RED color cookware gives the kitchen a pop versus the traditional black or titanium colors. I'd recommend that other people purchase this cookware set. Thus far I haven't had it for very long but so far so good.

..

6006840060008 These pans perform as described; nothing sticks to them and they are very easy to wash!

..

6006840060008 Great price . wonderful looking . love them ......

..

6006840060008 My wife has really enjoyed using these pots and pans since we purchased them. We previously had pretty outdated and mismatched items, so this has been a very welcome upgrade. She likes how the surfaces of all the items feel, and thinks they will last a very long time.

Cook your favorite soup at home with this soup maker that features a 48-oz. hot liquid and 56-oz. cold liquid capacity. The 4 blending speeds and 3 heat settings allow you to control how your soup is made.


..

6006840060008 This machine broke the first week during use. It sounded cheap, looks cheap, plastic gears and components. Disappointed with Cuisinart.

..

6006840060008 No Recipe book to help you use the the applicable dials and buttons. The manual explains the features but it would help if there were recipes to apply. Chops good for smoothies, I will test to see if it will make almond butter, cashew butter, However, it's difficult to clean the blades unless you remove from jar. The rubber gasket looks like it will take on mold after awhile, I will continue to check for that. I chopped garlic and the insides smelled until I allowed it to set in bleach and water. The drawback is that you can't immerse the jar in water to clean. Jar is heavy.

..

6006840060008 Its a great idea. Being able to make blend and heat soups and other dishes in one unit. Units such as the Thermomix and others have successgully done it for many years around the world. So when I noticed this 2013 product at Best Buy with a 3 year warranty I thought it was a safe bet. I was wrong. After 3 normal everyday uses of my machine it stopped blending. The motor in the blender does not appear to be powerful enough for the job it was intended to do. It struggled to blend from the moment I got it of the box. I am currently trying to get it fixed underwarranty. The Cuisinart warranty is not worth anything. They dodge and duck, hinder and avoid to ensure that it will cost you more in the end to get it fixed than the products worth.

..

6006840060008 Purchased it and thought it would be nice for making soup (that is what it is sold for). We had particularly bad luck. It is slower than a crock pot and will scorch thick soup also. Good ides but POOR design

..

6006840060008 After reading the great review in ShopSmart magazine, I thought I would give it a try. We made one of the soup recipes from the booklet enclosed with the blender. It was just average tasting. Then, I tried a sauce, same result. An immersion hand held blender would do the same job with less clean up.
We love to make smoothies in our house, but I was disappointed that it took several attempts to completely liquefy the frozen strawberries or any other frozen fruit we tried out.
I really had high hopes for this dual purpose blender, but may end up returning it.

..

6006840060008 The soup maker feature is really getting a workout around our house. It is amazing how quickly it churns out soup for my wife and I. There is a recipe booklet with it and it is nice but wayyyyyy too small. Need more soup recipes!

..

6006840060008 This heated blender by Cuisinart is genius! First of all, it still functions as a normal blender for cold blending. But, giving it a dual purpose to include soup and sauce making...well, who wouldn't want that!? I have been using my blender for almost a year now, so I have gone through all the seasons and used it for smoothies and soups. Now that the Fall season is officially back, I have already gotten back to making warm, savory soups, and my kids have been requesting their favorite hot chocolate. They no longer want the pre-packaged kind...they want it made in the Soup maker and blender using milk, cocoa powder, and chocolate chips. Sometimes I add a drop of peppermint, or orange extract to give it a different "twist"! Using this product for soup making is so simple. It has a "stir" function if you want a more chunky consistency. The soups come out perfect...and there are a lot of soup recipes out there, so the sky is the limit! It comes with a basic recipe book to get you started, but really, you can create your own with ease, once you get a feel for the ratio of liquid/veggies etc. that are needed. Soup is so good for you, and it's a way for me to get some veggies into my kids! Add some crusty bread or biscuits with it and you have a simple meal for your family! I have made cream of brocolli, creamy tomato-basil, carrot/curry, French onion, Asparagus, Potato...all have turned out delicious! It's kind of like the story from Stone Soup...you probably ALWAYS have things on hand in your pantry or in the fridge, in a pinch, to throw in and make a delicious soup. Give this a try...you won't be disappointed! Makes a great gift too!

Cuisinart's 4-Cup Coffeemaker is now available with a stainless steel carafe. It's compact enough to use for a small household or second home. Automatic shut-off after 30 minutes, so there is no need to worry when you leave the house in a hurry.


..

6006840060008 Good purchase.The heating portion gets dirty and starts peeling with spills. It is stainless steel goes well with the other kitchen appliances and is durable

..

6006840060008 I love coffee, and I'm always looking for a great coffee maker. This one is perfect because of the steel jar. It does not break when I wash it, and it last forever.

..

6006840060008 sturdy, makes two great cups of coffee. but i dawdle between cups and when i go back for the second cup the unit has shut off, requiring reheating in microwave. could make one cup at a time, but seems
like a waste of filters, and time

..

6006840060008 I think it looks great compared to the all white makers or clear carafes but i dont leave mine out when im not using it, but if i ever did it matches my stainless steel appliances great ... any way i have a plug near my sink so i just use my faucet to fill the coffee maker up with water and it works perfect for me ... after the coffee is made i just pour it slow into my mug and it does not leak, if you pour to fast or tilt it to far when it is filled with coffee, it does leak out the seam but most 4 cup carafes do that ... just pour slow ... it makes great coffee for me and then i just rinse out the carafe when im done and put it away ... the only issue is for ALL 4 cup makers is that they use 6 oz as 1 cup and most mugs are 12 oz or even larger so you need to understand you are gonna get 2 mug fulls of coffee

..

6006840060008 This coffeemaker is perfect for my tiny NYC-size kitchen. With limited counter space, this coffeemaker is perfect. I've had it about a month and it works perfectly.

..

6006840060008 This is the worst design I could imagine. It's like the manufacturer must not have even tried it out before selling it!!! The carafe design is horrible. It is impossible to pour water or coffee without spilling it everywhere! The water seems to spill out between the rim of the carafe and the carafe. There's a mess to clean up after filling the resavoir and after pouring coffee. It is also hard to fill the resavoir because the lid doesn't open wide enough.
I would have returned this after the first use if I hadn't have thrown the box away without trying it. Big mistake!

..

6006840060008 Using a normal coffee cup only makes about 1.5 cups. Top of carafe is hard to get off. When pouring water into coffee maker, unless you hold the top down when pouring water leaks down the side of the carafe all over counter. Very disappointed. I got it as a gift so I didn't dish out any money for it which was good.

..

6006840060008 The automatic shut off is a great feature. Nice coffee
maker for the price.
One little flaw is the black paint where the carafe sits, is already wearing off after approximate 2 months of use. It shouldn't make any difference in the longevity of usage, and doesn't show until you remove the carafe. That is why it is rated 4 instead of 5.
The coffee tastes great and the attractive and compact design looks great on the counter.

..

6006840060008 it's fast & makes good coffee but not as hot as i like.

..

6006840060008 I never bought a coffee maker with a stainless steel carafe. If has a nice look in the kitchen and the size was perfect for my needs.

..

6006840060008 
The Cuisinart Compact Toaster is not just smaller than standard 2-slice toasters, it's better Streamlined and specially designed to sit sideways or facing forward on kitchen counters, the LED touchpad controls and a 9-setting LED backlit browning dial are within easy reach either way. That's a nice position to be in.


..

6006840060008 One side of the toast browns while the other side burns. The very thing that I was replacing when I purchased this toaster.

..

6006840060008 I have gotten perfect toast and toasted bagels a dozen times so far

..

6006840060008 5 stars for this toaster. I already had the 4 slice toaster but my son wanted a 2 slice for his apt.

..

6006840060008 Even though this is an inexpensive toaster, do not buy it. Spend a little extra money and get one that will work correctly. I have this and am very unhappy. It burns bread on the lowest setting. The only way around is to watch and end teh toasting cycle before it's complete to prevent the burning.

The easy-to-use, large capacity Custom 14 Food Processor speeds up all your cooking from quick weeknight meals to weekend celebrations.


..

6006840060008 I've only had this food processor for a few weeks, but it's pretty amazing.
Chopping: It's like lightning! Chops and purees even a small amount of food in its large bowl.
Slicing: Slices veggies and fruits very thin, very fast. If you're looking for picture-perfect slices you have to go one piece at a time, but if you just want some slices for say, pizza, this baby'll slice it up in no time.
Grating: Used it to grate some hard cheese for pizza -- no fuss, no muss.
Dough: The dough blade is great! I always dreaded trying to mix pizza dough and other doughs by hand but the dough blade makes smooth, well-blended doughs in no time.
Yes, it's a pricey machine but so far, I think it's worth it. It seems to be very sturdy and well-made and I plan on having this food processor for a long time.

Cuisinart CCJ-500DG Electric Juicer - 300 W Motor - Dark Green


..

6006840060008 Great to use, certainly better than squeezing by hand, a cinch to clean up

..

6006840060008 It's old technology that still works fine. Simple to use, push and voila...
the only thing is this product is limited to citrus fruits.

..

6006840060008 Its a good product for its price. Very handy. Its good for small families because you will have to clean it after 2 glasses of juice else it won't flow properly.

..

6006840060008 I like the product. mainly because I can juice my lemons and limes. without making a huge mess...

..

6006840060008 I was looking for a quality orange juicer and Besybuy employee showed me this product. I have been using 3-4 times a week and I really like it.

..

6006840060008 Great little machine. We use is primarily for making lemonade in the summer but it's been fine for Orange juice now

6006840060008 My recommendation is that do not juice every orange until it's bare to the skin do some until you get 70% of the juice from each half first and then do the remaining from all the halves. Fresh OJ is the best thing, I usually get the OJ and throw in some frozen mixed berries and mix them for an amazing concoction. There's so many varieties of oranges or there, I buy Sunkist kind, what kind do you buy ?

..

6006840060008 Have used it almost every morning. Easy simple to use and does a great job.

..

6006840060008 We have a small orange tree that produces LOTS of oranges. We make fresh orange juice most mornings to avoid discarding the excess oranges. Initially, I used a traditional manual juicer, but it was a pain constantly emptying the reservoir and I couldn't get all the juice/pulp out of the oranges. This little juicer makes it so much quicker and easier. It is super easy to clean up and doesn't take much space. I may only use it for a few months out of the year, but it is well worth it to me. I've only had it a couple months so I don't know how long it will last, but it seems to be well made.

..

6006840060008 Works really well for juicing. Just keep the extra pulp setting open or it will clog.

Create your favorite frozen yogurt, ice cream and sorbet with this automatic dessert-maker that simultaneously produces 1 quart each of 2 different flavors or up to 2 quarts of 1 flavor.


..

6006840060008 Easy to use. Directions are clear. The ice cream almost tastes like gelato. The sorbet is also excellent. Haven't made the frozen yogurt yet, but that is next! The recipes in the enclosed booket is great.

Cuisinart DLC-6 Food Processor - 8 Cup (Capacity) - Chrome


..

6006840060008 Cuisinart food processors are highly rated and this one has been great so far. The price was the lowest anywhere too.

..

6006840060008 Would recommend this to anyone looking for a good food processor. Great for quick salad setup. Clean up is a breeze!

..

6006840060008 Works well, cleans easily, and stores easily. What more can you expect.
Plus because of it we are eating more and different veggies. Which is good for our health.

..

6006840060008 This food processor is a nice size for most uses, and has sufficient power...it has several blades, making it very versatile when preparing foods...is easy to clean, and is attractive! I am very pleased with the quality for the price!!

..

6006840060008 I don't know why I haven't bought this sooner! Super easy to use, comes apart quickly, and very easy clean up.

..

6006840060008 Don't think about it, just buy it for those cooking projects you have always wanted to do. This will do the job and very well.

..

6006840060008 The suction cups are a great idea, we have granite counters and it holds well and very quick, we make Pico and salsa and its great.

..

6006840060008 This is my first food processor, and I did a lot of research before purchasing it. I've not used it much yet, but they few times that I have, it got the job done in a fraction of the time it would have taken to do by hand. So far very pleased.

..

6006840060008 The size and quality were great for the price. I returned it for the next model up for a little more money and a varied size feeding tube.

..

6006840060008 I paid really good price for this food processor. (Good quality and powerful)

Cuisinart's Metal Classic Toaster has a smooth brushed stainless housing with polished chrome and black accents. Its custom controls let you defrost and toast bagels and bread -- just the way you want them!


..

6006840060008 Purchased as a gift for our son and the toaster performs as advertised and as the reputation states.

..

6006840060008 Works great and easy to use. Replaces many past toaster ovens which are messy and heats bread, etc inconsistently. So far so good!

..

6006840060008 Toasts great and like the different settings. Very easy to use and clean.

..

6006840060008 This toaster is the mack daddy of all toasters....sure, you can spend more or less, but fully functional and easy to use...simple and elegant lines lead to an expectation of the best toasted bread, bagels, and pop tarts. I like the boring, dull finish which reminds me so much of the toasters of the 1960s....I would buy another toaster just like it, but probably wont get the chance to, as this one will last forever...gotta go, time to make some toast.

..

6006840060008 The functions are value added. Already utilizing the frozen and cancel features plus the toast controls are awesome! The design looks great in a small kitchen where countertop space small. Blends well with other Stainless Steel appliances. The only downside to stainless steel is that it requires wiping down with a stainless steel product or All Purpose Pledge

..

6006840060008 The more toaster reviews you read the more confusing it gets. Read reviews of a specific toaster on one website then on another and you think you are looking at two completely different products. So I decided to take a deep breath and order one I like the looks of. Well this happens to be a very decent toaster, browns the bread evenly and consistantly. Did not try toasting more than 3 batches of toasts on the same - light setting and all three batches came out pretty much the same color. Can't ask for much more from a toaster. The slots could be longer though.

..

6006840060008 Wanted just a toaster instead of small oven and this fits everything!

..

6006840060008 It works well. However, when you toast smaller items like english muffins they are more difficult to get out.

..

6006840060008 The product looks good and simple to use. The slots are wide
for bagels especially.

..

6006840060008 It looks great on my kitchen and is very functional. I've only had it for a couple of weeks so I can't really comment on its durability. I've actually had someone comment on how nice it looks (and toasters aren't usually attention-getting). Recommend highly!

..

6006840060008 
Our Metal Classic 4-Slice Toaster delivers innovative looks and spectacular performance. Two control panels each toast two items at a time, to any shade you want. That means you can toast thick sliced breads at the same time you're doing bagels! Feature two 6-setting browning Dials and dual Bagel, Reheat and Defrost Controls with LED indicators.


..

6006840060008 Not even my 81 year old mother, who will probably burn the house down one day, can burn toast in this toaster! It evenly toasts. I can have lightly browned toast and she can have dark toast... no need to toast twice, try to guess and make it pop up, etc . We hand slice bread so it can handle thick slices of bread, bagels and that sort of thing with no problem. Before, she would toast something twice and on the third try, attempt to guess when it was right and suddenly there would be smoke and it was a disaster. This one does it right the first time.

..

6006840060008 This is my second Cuisinart toaster. I loved the first one so much that I am replacing it with another Cuisinart toaster. The only difference is the new one is a 4 slice toaster and the old one is a 2 slice toaster.

..

6006840060008 I recommend this product for the price and versatile

..

6006840060008 Very pleased with this toaster and would recommend its purchase

..

6006840060008 My old toaster broke and all my kids wanted for Christmas was a new toaster. Even after opening all their toys they were still looking for the toaster. I surprised them with on a couple weeks after Christmas and they love it!

..

6006840060008 We can enjoy different level of crusts on the same time while it is still crispy.

..

6006840060008 I haven't opened it yet, but it's pretty and will look nice only counter.

..

6006840060008 Looks very nice and it works great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

..

6006840060008 Looking for a simple 4 slice toaster and saw this model at BestBuy. Light weight, 4 slice and easy to use. That is all I wanted in a toaster.

..

6006840060008 great toaster . Easy to use, convenient four slice toasting. Toast comes out perfect evry time.

ProCenter 1000 Center Channel Speaker-the heart of a spectacular Home Theater system The ProCenter 1000 is Definitive's "Better" center speaker in the acclaimed Pro Series. A ProCenter 1000 along with four ProMonitor 800s or ProMonitor 1000s and a matching ProSub makes a complete ProCinema system. All the components of the system are packed and sold separately allowing you to mix and match Pro Series components to build the system that best suits your needs. Don't let the ProCenter 1000's small size and affordable price fool you-it is a remarkably sophisticated product with huge sound. The 1000 incorporates many of the same technologies as Definitive's top-of-the-line models including BDSS drivers, pure aluminum dome tweeters, and planar pressure coupled mid/bass radiators for home theater sound quality that will astound you.


..

6006840060008 Sound quality was my first priority, but having beautiful white speakers to match my decor was a very close second! I had to hunt around for specs and went onto the manufacturer's website to see that they are so efficient that they will handle a 4 ohm impedance. Because of the driver sizes used, they actually have a tonal resonance that matches the pro monitors 800 better than the 1000 satellite speakers, so save yourself some money. The 1000 satellites match up with the 2000 center speaker better!

Easily heat water for your tea, coffee or other beverage with this DeLonghi KBO1401BK 1.7L electric kettle that features a flat, stainless-steel concealed element for optimal performance. The washable antiscale filter helps keep water pure.


..

6006840060008 I've been looking all over for an electric kettle that stands out and finally came across this DeLonghi. Absolutely love the shape and it's worked great so far. Boils a couple minutes faster than an older generic kettle that's since became garbage. It's a little pricey but you get what you pay for (in terms of look so far, hope it goes for durability as well).

..

6006840060008 
Enjoy rich coffee with this DeLonghi DCF6214T coffeemaker that features an aroma button, which enhances your coffee's flavor and scent. The pause 'n serve function lets you pour a cup of coffee before the pot is finished brewing when you're in a rush.


..

6006840060008 All would be great if the coffee pot did not spill each and every time anytime something is poured from it. It does not matter if it is water when filling or coffee when serving. Everyone who uses it has to clean up a puddle when through pouring. It is definately a fault in the design of the pot.

The progressive electronic browning control on this DeLonghi CTO2003R 2-slice toaster makes it easy to select the shade of toast you want. Reheat, defrost, one-side bagel and cancel functions allow simple customization.


..

6006840060008 I admit it, we bought this toaster because it looks cool. And in that area, this toaster is a winner. But after you get over how pretty it is, you start to feel like you might have paid a lot for the form and missed out on the function. The lever that is supposed to lift the toast up so you can retrieve it without burning your hands... does almost nothing. The slots for the toast are smallish, and if you use the bagel button you're going to end up with one very burnt bagel (just use a low regular setting to avoid this). Also, and this is still mystifying to me, the product image shows a round, black knob on top that I assumed must be for lifting the toast out without burning your hands. But the toaster arrived at my door with no such knob either on it or in the box waiting to be assembled (I checked 3 times). This was a disappointment. Overall, I would call this toaster adequate, but if you buy it, remember you are paying for the looks.

This espresso and cappuccino maker features a durable stainless-steel boiler and self-priming operation to make your favorite beverage quick and easy. The 48-oz. water tank is removable for easy filling.


..

6006840060008 We got this to replace our Espressione Cafe Retro after 6 years of spotty service. I loved the way the old one looked but it was a bit temperamental. Still, when it worked properly, it made good espresso.
The DeLonghi doesn't look as good or feel as solid as our old machine  also you can't put as many grounds in it so it's a bit weaker  but it's working as it's supposed to so far.
Decent value for the money if you like this style of machine.

..

6006840060008 Overall, I am very pleased with my DeLonghi - Icona Pump-Driven Espresso Maker. I enjoy cappuccino every morning.

..

6006840060008 I would definitely recommend this machine if you are looking for a beginner machine, makes some really good shots and good foamy milk

This DeLonghi kMix DCM04BL coffeemaker features a 10-cup capacity so you can make multiple servings at once. The one-touch control offers simple use.


..

6006840060008 The DeLonghi kMix 10-cup coffee maker is an easy-to-use, easy-to-clean coffee maker with a contemporary style. I really like the sliding lid for the water repository. It uses #4 filters and brews quickly.
The carafe could be designed better. The spout is designed such that you cannot pour out all the coffee (or pour out all the water when you wash it), and it was several days before I realized the lid could be detached from the carafe. (It happened to come off when I was washing it.) The included instructions are minimalistic. After several months of use the light on the front started to blink. There was nothing in the manual to indicate what this meant, but I found reviews online that said the light blinks when the coffee maker needs to be descaled.
Despite the less than desirable design of the carafe, I would recommend this coffee maker.

..

6006840060008 I bought this for my parents. They love the speed at which it brews their coffee but aren't too crazy about the lip on the coffee pot. They said it doesn't pour nicely into the cup and makes a bit of a mess. Too bad....I would have never paid this much for a coffee maker for myself. For the price you'd think it should be relatively flaw-free.

..

6006840060008 Previous DeLonghi espresso maker from Target within few months stopped dripping. This one is beginning to drip very slowly.

..

6006840060008 Espresso was excellent. The steamer, despite previous reviews, made a great silky foam.
Unfortunate that the gasket broke so quickly. I'm still waiting for the part a month later.
I can't give it a rating as I only used it once.

..

6006840060008 this product is too good. I would have accepted something a lot worse. I expected coffee. I got coffee. but good coffee. very. very. very good coffee! it didn't have to be this good. but it is. I'm a little scared of its potential actually and that one day it may rise up and take control creating some form of coffee themed dictatorship with delicious steamed milk.
but yeah. its really good.

..

6006840060008 Great little machine. It looks good on the counter but really suprises you with how good of a job it does at making your favorite coffee house drinks. It is very easy to clean. Steams milk very fast and makes good foam. Make sure you have a good burr grinder for your coffee, took me a few tries to get it how I like it.

..

6006840060008 I have always been intimidated by the idea of making my own espresso and lattes but decided to give this machine a shot after reading reviews on it over the web.

6006840060008 Previous DeLonghi espresso maker from Target within few months stopped dripping. This one is beginning to drip very slowly.

..

6006840060008 Espresso was excellent. The steamer, despite previous reviews, made a great silky foam.
Unfortunate that the gasket broke so quickly. I'm still waiting for the part a month later.
I can't give it a rating as I only used it once.

..

6006840060008 this product is too good. I would have accepted something a lot worse. I expected coffee. I got coffee. but good coffee. very. very. very good coffee! it didn't have to be this good. but it is. I'm a little scared of its potential actually and that one day it may rise up and take control creating some form of coffee themed dictatorship with delicious steamed milk.
but yeah. its really good.

..

6006840060008 Great little machine. It looks good on the counter but really suprises you with how good of a job it does at making your favorite coffee house drinks. It is very easy to clean. Steams milk very fast and makes good foam. Make sure you have a good burr grinder for your coffee, took me a few tries to get it how I like it.
-High quality machine
-Makes great coffee
-Cleans up easily

..

6006840060008 I have always been intimidated by the idea of making my own espresso and lattes but decided to give this machine a shot after reading reviews on it over the web.
It is super easy to use, clean, and maintain. Takes me about 10-15 minutes tops to make 2 lattes each morning.

..

6006840060008 This machine ROCKS! very powerful.
worked great, fast and easy to use...

..

6006840060008 Really easy to use. The only down side is that doesn't swivel.

..

6006840060008 I dont know how i went so long without this!! I love how clean it makes my floors feel and so quick!

..

6006840060008 I love this steam cleaner! It works so well on my hardwood floors. I love how easy it is to set up and use. The cord is long enough and the water "tank" is enough IMO. Excellent product!

..

6006840060008 Love it love it love it... That is all I have to say :)

..

6006840060008 My daughter bought one when she was training her puppy to clean the tile from accidents, that was two years ago. She loved it and still has it.
We bought a family lake home last year and I decided to get one for cleaning the tile and wood floors so people wouldnt have to do it on their hands and knees. Everyone loves it. It gets used at least one a week on about 1000 square feet of flooring and we have had no problems with it at all. Two of our family members have bought them after using mine and love them.
I am going to buy another one for our home to clean my entry rugs and wood floors.
I wouldn't hesitate to buy this product.

..

6006840060008 First of all, the day I was expecting my steam mop, the delivery guy just dumped the product on my doorstep. What was strange is that I was in my living room where my front door is located. Didn't hear a knock or anything...just shuffling of feet and the sound of the delivery truck leaving. This was not bestbuy.com's fault so I'm not going to point them out on this..
BUT when I saw the package, the product was shipped in its original box. The company should know by now that people in shipping services are not the most careful people in the world. The box itself was flimsy and it appeared that it went through a lot. Anyhow, nothing was cracked nor were there scratches, but I feel that it could have been packaged to prevent potential damage.
SO when I filled when I assembled the steam mop (as per instructions) the unit still did not work. The light didn't even go on..nothing. I waited a few minutes thinking that it just needs time (item is supposed to start releasing steam in 30 seconds). As I mentioned before, It didn't look damaged by the shipping, yet I have no idea why it didn't turn on. To my dissappointment, it didn't work so I went directly to the store and traded it in with the Dirt Devil Gator since they didn't have this item in stock. Got a refund and costumer service was excellent. My overall review is that product look painfully flimsy and seemed like it could break after a few uses even if it did work. The base of the mop stick which connected to the steamer made weird noises which didn't sound too good (it wasn't cracked or anythng though). I personally would not recommend buying from this site, or even any other online site. I am also not confident in this product itself. Not sure if you guys still want to buy it, but hey..maybe it will work for you guys.

..

6006840060008 I purchased the dirt devil steam mop (black) with much excitment thinking I was going to have clean floors, however after using it just three times it quit working. Waisted my money on this product. It was hard to push, ran out of water to quickly, too small of water tank, two long of cord and the list of warnings went on forever. I believe this product should be jerked from the shelves so customers can spend their money on another brand that will work.

..

6006840060008 I purchased this with doing my carpet in mind. Have used it so far to mop the tile (Have alot of it) and it does a great job. Decided today that I would attempt the carpet and WOW. I was fortunate enough to get this for $30 and the value is unbeatable. yes I am spending a bit more time probably then I would with a more costly unit but now I know when I want to upgrade I will defiantly stick to steam mops that are reasonable. So far I have seem a lot of complaints that after 2-3 xs they didnt work I havent had that problem at all. This cleaned my carpet and believe me when I say it was dirty (had a sick 18 yr old cat) its cleaner than I imagined. I fully recommend this. Going to get one for my daughter who is just moving out on her own.

..

6006840060008 Got a "deal" on this steam vac for $30 on sale. Used the unit two times - on the third use, the unit would turn on, but would not produce steam. Best Buy warranty = 30-45 days. Must contact Dirt Devil, spent hours on phone with 'customer service'. Offered to replace if I mail in old unit cord and model sticker.
Would NOT purchase again - does not work that good on tile floor. I prefer my traditional mop. Difficult to fill water, feels flimsy, doesn't store easily, doesn't seem like mop heads will last very long.

..

6006840060008 I have a 10 ft. by 18 foot floor I wanted to keep clean. Used product twice and worked fairly well, a little hard to push. Used only bottled water as directed. On the 3rd use it would not steam at all! Followed all directions. Now have to cantact Dirt Devil for warranty and they are not help full. Should last more than 2 floor cleanings for 180 square foot floor. Product also feels cheaply made at pivot joint and in handle.

This Elite Classic EPM-250 popcorn popper features a stainless-steel kettle with a 2-1/2-oz. kernel capacity and a built-in stirring system for thoroughly popped kernels. The pull-out popcorn tray lets you easily access popcorn.


..

6006840060008 This popcorn popper was a Christmas gift for my husband. It is a good little popper---little meaning only pops 1/3 cup kernels at a time, for bigger appetites it does take a couple of batches. Difficult to let the popper cool down and than warm up for the next batch. Beats the flavor of microwave popcorn.

..

6006840060008 We love this little machine and use it a lot. The kids love watching it pop. It fits nicely on top of the cabnet, and looks good when not in use.We are very pleased with our purchase.

..

6006840060008 it is fun t o look at it, but the time and effort spent for such a meager amount of popcorn will relegate it to the garage

..

6006840060008 We love it! Super easy to use and clean.....fun for the kids to use. Highly recommend!

..

6006840060008 I tried to return this coffee maker. Even with a filter there was a lot of coffee grounds in any cup. The manual says to use "coarse ground coffee." Most commercial coffee is a fine grind. I did not want to buy a coffee grinder. Best Buy would not let me return the machine.

..

6006840060008 This is an Android 7" 4.0 OS, 4GB memory tablet + 5GB Cloud Storage for files, videos, music, etc.
If you are in the market for a good android tablet I would recommend the Ematic Eglide 7" Pro III multi touch screen tablet. The easy to use functions are displayed well and are ready to use with a slight touch of your finger..or if you have a capacitive stylus that works too.
I had my Android Ematic Eglide for more than 2 weeks and luckily had no problems.
The features of this 7" tablet includes an ebooks reader which you can access over 1 million books via the pre-loaded Kobo application, HD Video player, Built in MP3 Music player, Voice Recorder, Photo Video Player and much more.

This 512Mb processor also allows you to access the internet with no problem. Good Value.

..

6006840060008 I bought an ematic tablet that failed right out of the box. Sent it for repair ($14 expense) and it took 6 weeks, only to be not working (same problem) right out of the box again. I don't think they actually did anything to it! I'm in the process of trying to retrieve my investment; wish me luck!

Enjoy crispy food with this Emeril FR7015001 fryer that features 1000W of power and an immersion heating element for efficient operation. The automatic filtration and drainage system utilizes built-in storage container for simple cleanup and reusability.


..

6006840060008 This is a great deep fryer for the money. I like how the oil is filtered then stored in its own container. The gauge for the oil life is a nice addition as well. Every thing is dishwasher safe with the exception of the element

..

6006840060008 This fryer is awesome. I filter the oil and clean the fryer after every use. The oil lasts so much longer and food tastes better. Added benefit is that I am not eating everything out of my fryer for a week or two anymore just to get the most out of the oil before it goes bad. Everything is easy - I just put everything in the dishwasher for easy cleanup except for the heating element, which I wash by hand.

..

6006840060008 this is our second one and would not even think about owning a different one. by far the best deep fryer out there. just love it!

Emerson GQ100 Karaoke System


..

6006840060008 This machine is a total piece of junk. Most of the times it won't read the disks, when it does it skips around, displays only part of the lyrics and doesn't follow them. Wouldn't even work with the disk that came with it...which by the way, is a bunch of really really lame songs like Happy Birthday and Auld Lang Syne with background singing by someone's junior high choir.

This flatbed scanner can restore faded color photos with a single touch. Create enlargements up to 17" x 22" directly from film at up to 6400 dpi resolution.


..

6006840060008 Works well as advertised. Generally produced usable results.

..

6006840060008 Bought to help scan in family photos. It is a long-term project, just a few each day. The Epson scanner does a great job recognizing the photos, 35mm slides,and negatives.

..

6006840060008 It does exactly as advertised. It is a wonderful scanner. Would recommend to anyone.

..

6006840060008 it is a good scanner for printed material, good color, easy setup
I bought this scanner to scan photos, 35 mm negatives and documents. It works great for photos and docs but is useless for negatives.
when you scan negatives, at any resolution, scans are unfocused and images are blur
Dont buy if you want scan negatives
Frames for films are fragile and dont provide good support for negative .Frames has control marks, then, you cant use a strong support like glass or acrylic.

..

6006840060008 So far so very good with this scanner. I've scanned dozens of photos and hundreds of slides so far. It scans 4 slides at once and set to 3200 dpi it only takes about 3 minutes to do it. Comes with Photoshop elements which is more software than I'll ever need. Overall I'm very happy with this scanner. I would have given 5 stars but it came with lint or dust on the inside of the glass from the factory.

..

6006840060008 Sof far so good. I've only used it to scan a check to deposit to my bank. Hope the slide scanning function works but haven't tried it yet. Set up was quick and easy. I'm delighted so far.

..

6006840060008 Probably not as cheap as some all in one printer / scanners, but the quality, spped and features more than compensate.

..

6006840060008 It is a nice scanner, does a good job on documents and I've scanned about 100 35mm B&W and color negatives with great results. The included Adobe Photoshop I really really like. Only one small complaint; the film holder is a bit flimsy.

..

6006840060008 My 5 year old Visioneer 9020 died so I first bought a Canon 8800F but returned it because I could not get a clear scan no matter what I did. Bought this and have been nothing but happy with it so far. Everything I have scanned has been very clean and clear with good color matching. I should have known to make this my first pick since I have an 8 year old Epson 1160 printer and a 3 year old Epson all in one; both have been flawless with great results and I have never even had to clean the heads on the 1160 model. I highly recommend this scanner for all but the extreme cases. Great job Epson.

..

6006840060008 My old scanner would not work with Windows Vista so I bough this one and its great. Scanes fast and lines up your photo for you. I tried tilting the picture out of square and it comes in scaned square every time. I can haRDLY WAIT TO START RESTORING SOME PICTURES.

..

6006840060008 I'm very happy with my new Epson scanner. What I intend on doing is getting an external 35mm film adapter to work with it. I'd recommend this item to anyone............!!!!!!!!!!!

..

6006840060008 It's excellent to be able to either push a button or control it from the desktop. The software used is easy to understand--i.e. user friendly. Scans quickly and good quality.

..

6006840060008 I was a little skeptical when I saw this Epson scanner for a fraction of the price that other scanners were going for. I use the scanner for personal items, like scanning documents and pictures. I am very impressed with the quality of the scans and the ease of use. I definitely did not sacrifice quality for an economical price!

..

6006840060008 This product scans fine but only in pdf and photo format. If that is all you want, it is fine. I have not returned the product since I need a scanner and I have separate fax and laser print machines.

..

6006840060008 Easy to set up and use. Gives good quality for the price. Have had it for a month now and no problems using it so far.

..

6006840060008 I bought my daughter this same scanner to use in her dorm room. I was so impressed by the quality of the scans, I purchased one for my office too. Easy to use, quiet and does not take up a lot of space.

..

6006840060008 The scanner performs all the functions as advertised. It is ieasy to install and use.

..

6006840060008 I do agree with other remarks I've read on this scanner that the cord placement is extremely odd. But for the price and the quality of the scans, I'm willing to overlook it. Plus it's fast to scan, love that.

..

6006840060008 Totally outrageous scan quality for the price. It takes a while to figure out how to use it. It is not as simple as my older scanner, even though the resolution is much greater.

..

6006840060008 works good for home use- bills, important docs, etc

..

6006840060008 This shredder works much better than the higher priced ones that I have purchased in the past..It has a metal basket to catch the stuff that is shredded which allows you to see when it is full and needs to be emptied....so far so good....

..

6006840060008 It gets the shredding job done. I'm happy with it so far.

..

6006840060008 Great home shredder - shreds quickly and the basket base lets you know when it needs to be emptied. Only negative is it will only shred things 9" wide. Shred chute could be wider.

..

6006840060008 I like how quickly it can be used and can handle 5-10 pages at a time.

..

6006840060008 It's easy to empty the basket. You don't have to do it every 2 seconds, either. I can go 2-3-4 days without having to empty it.
Putting it back together after emptying it, half the time I couldn't figure out which way the basket should go. Once I knew which side was the back, I put a sticky label on there saying "back," and now I have no trouble knowing how to reassemble it.
I like that the shreds aren't little tiny pieces. If anything falls onto the floor as I'm in the process of emptying the shredder, it's no big deal, easy to pick up the few shreds. Then I put a plastic bag over the basket, turn it all upside down, and the rest is simple.

..

6006840060008 I had been looking for a new shredder for use at home. You hear so much about identity theft these days. This shredder shreds into very small pieces. It is easy to use. I've not had to use it too much so far, but it will certainly get a good workout at tax time. The price was also very good. It will also shred credit cards, which will certainly come in handy.

..

6006840060008 I don't leave the house without the Fitbit! It challenges me to beat my number of steps from the previous day!

..

6006840060008 I bought 2, for my wife and I. We compete daily on who has more steps and actually gets us to move more. Easy to use and gets the job done

..

6006840060008 Bought this so my wife and I can work on being more active. They have us competing on who has the most steps each day so in essence it works. Synced very easily with our HTC M8 and Samsung Galaxy Note 3.

..

6006840060008 I am excited to get to use it and track my progress. Phone app is handy as well.

..

6006840060008 This is great for the price it is a little sensitive when walking so as you are setting it up it is actually counting activity even though you are not doing anything; outside of that the tracking is awesome.
It seems to be pretty reliable so far and it is very easy to use...the one negative was in mine you really had to jam the battery in to get it to hold in place while you locked the door. On top of that once it was in you would think it was not because you really have to tap the screen hard to get it to turn on...That is a plus and a minus..good for if you drop it it can handle the impact bad just for being a pain haha.
other than that if you wanted a simple tracker for a lot less money than fuel bands, and all the other watches and trackers out there priced at $100+ more than this is the item for you....It is definitely worth it for the cost difference.

..

6006840060008 Bought these for my parents to use, as they are avid walkers. They LOVE these...hubby did the computer set-up for them, as the Fitbit website can be tricky. My parents are already competing against each other to see who walks the most.

..

6006840060008 I would give it a better rating if I still had it. The app was really great, not crazy about the battery. The grip as you clip it on your cloth is not secure. I would clip it on my bra and somehow I lost it :(

..

6006840060008 This is a great pedimator yet the screen can be hard to read. I gave this to my mom and she loves it.

..

6006840060008 I purchased the zip in March and I am addicted to IT!
It is very easy to use,synchs with any phone and holds me accountable to daily goals. It tracks steps,calories,miles, and "active minutes". The zip in small and easily clips to your pants or bra strap.
I recommend a FITBIT to anyone who loves to move or wants motivation to move more.

..

6006840060008 Liked that I could pick it up in the store. Good variety of colors. Perfect size to wear it daily

..

6006840060008 Very good camera. Very good price. Very good product. Have other
Fuji cameras.

..

6006840060008 I am happy with the size, performance, picture quality and the 20x zoom of such a small camera. I like the fact that it is adaptable to many situations. Many features included are found on more expensive SLR type cameras. A great buy.

..

6006840060008 I've had 2 Fuji cameras previously that were very good. I wanted a smaller and lighter on this time. The video button is in a position that you will turn it on as you are snapping a photo. While balancing the camera, your finger in on the flash, the wrist attachment would not thread so it was unusable. After having the photos printed (at a shop - not a home printer) I felt the quality wasn't any better than my previous cameras although more pixels and zoom. I returned the camera. The saleman stated Fuji camera quality had declined in the last few years and recommended a Cannon. Right now I'll stay with my S800.

Capture high-quality photos with this Fujifilm FinePix F800EXR 16.0-megapixel digital camera that features EXR Auto for snapping up-close subjects. The 1080p video mode lets you shoot high-definition movie clips.


..

6006840060008 I bought the earlier version of this camera (F70 EXR) about 4 yrs ago, it was a bit more than I wanted to spend, but the reviews on various camera sites were great. It's certainly not been a "pampered" camera as it is thrown in my purse without a camera case, but it is always ready to take a picture whenever, where ever you need. The most impressive thing, to me, is the optical zoom feature and the stability control -- you can zoom in (not all the way) then edit the picture on the screen by zooming in, adjusting the picture (right/left), then cutting it without losing any of the picture quality. I've taken pictures of cars in motion, then zoomed & cut -- WOW! The pictures are great! Not ALL the pictures are clear, but with extra memory, you can pick & choose which ones to keep & which ones to get rid of. Overall, the best small, compact, digital camera I've ever had.
It is pretty scratched up now (with living in my purse for all these years), but has held up very well. I always charge the battery when I know it'll be used; the battery seems to give about 3 or 4 hrs of continuous use, or 200 (+/-) pictures. I've used mostly the EXR setting and only used the video once, so I can't really comment on much of the other settings or video quality. There is a setting that will take two pictures at different settings so you can pick the best one which is a pretty neat feature.
Just happened to see the "newer" version and thought I'd share my experience with the "older" one...

..

6006840060008 Bought this camera on line and shipped to home, so I didn't get to try it before I bought it.Pictures never looked as good in replay as they did in the screen. Image stabilization was sub par thru the full zoom range. Trade it for a Canon Powershot SX260 HS and I am very happy with it.

..

6006840060008 The picture quality is good, but what is impressive is that this camera can shoot 320fps. I was able to film a swing of a baseball bag and could actually see a ripple in the arm of the batter gradually move across the body.

Capture high-quality images with this Fujifilm FinePix JX650 digital camera, which features a 16.0-megapixel CCD sensor that enables you to shoot crisp photos and high-definition videos. Face detection helps create stunning portraits of loved ones.Memory card sold separately.


..

6006840060008 I got this camera on sale, which made it even better. The picture quality is very good. The video quality is also surprisingly good. It has lots of features and modes, kind of like the more expensive cameras. I did have some issues with getting the flash to work: even on auto, it wouldn't always use the flash in low-light settings, leaving the pictures dark. Besides that, though, we have had a good experience with this camera. We took it on vacation with us and came home with some great photos.

..

6006840060008 This camera is a good value and the ease of use made it the perfect camera to buy my elderly mom for her birthday.

..

6006840060008 Very nice camera looking wise & using it is very easy. My kids all use it.

..

6006840060008 I would buy it again. I wish I came with a memory card. The pictures are very good for an everyday camera

..

6006840060008 Simple camera with minimal features. Not recommended for night photos. Good to use in Day light and easy to carry.

..

6006840060008 I rec this as a gift. It is an ok camera nothing special. Has good features but not enough zoom.

..

6006840060008 I really like the ease of use on this camera, but not formatting my sd card, cost me to forfeit some important shots on my vacation. Stay away from the HD, takes up too much space on your card.

..

6006840060008 I won this camera as a door prize at a staff banquet and the dang thing didn't power up when I took it out of the box. I thought "oh the battery is dead" so I let it charge all night long (about 12 hours) and still no power. It works when plugged in, but that's it. I thought it was the battery so I bought a new battery and it still will not power up at all. I don't have the original receipt (but I have a copy) because it was a door prize. Bah hum bug!

..

6006840060008 Good camera for teenager. Easy to use and inexpensive.

..

6006840060008 Overall great product, cheap and very user friendly.

Snap vibrant photos with this Fujifilm FinePix S2980 digital camera that features a 14.0-megapixel 1/2.3" CCD sensor and dual image stabilization for image clarity. SR (Scene Recognition) AUTO optimizes camera settings based on your surroundings.


..

6006840060008 We got this camera on sale during the holidays for around $100, so it was a great price. We love the camera, but wish it could snap a bit quicker because it's really hard to catch a 2 year old in a certain pose before they have moved onto 10 different things. The picture quality is very good, but the LCD screen appears grainy at times. We had our second child this week, so I was snapping pics like a crazy man and the batteries lasted a week even when leaving it on too long while downloading the pics to my PC.
Overall - a good camera for the price and we are happy with our purchase.

..

6006840060008 This camera was easy to use right out of the box. Batteries have a reasonably long life.

..

6006840060008 
Capture detailed photos with this DSLR camera that features a 6-scene SR AUTO mode that automatically adjusts the camera's settings based on the surrounding conditions. CCD shift image stabilization makes it easy to shoot clear photos.


..

6006840060008 This camera is amazing, especially for the price. There are cameras that cost double and triple for the same exact features. There are modes that are point and shoot that take great pictures. It also has modes with custom setting for the more advanced photographers. Get professional looking pictures every time! I love photography, and I have small children, this camera gives me the opportunity to incorporate my hobby into my everyday busy life. Don't spend the $ on the pricier cameras, this one is top notch!
-excellent in all lighting
-great battery life

Capture stunning images with this 16.2-megapixel Fujifilm FinePix SL1000 BLACK digital camera that features optical image stabilization for sharp, steady shots and records video in up to 1920 x 1080i resolution for arresting picture quality.Memory card sold separately.


..

6006840060008 The camera is great. I wanted a high quality, super zoom and that is what I got. Due to the tendency to have shaking issues with any camera that has a significant zoom, I often use a burst mode. By taking several pictures at once, you are more likely to get a steady shot that is where you want it in the frame. The SL1000 has a shortcut button for burst mode (no more searching through the menu to find the feature). Best of all, Best Buy price-matched Amazon, plus I had some reward dollars from a previous purchase, making it even cheaper.

..

6006840060008 Very good camera for the price range. Bought it as a backup and carry all the time camera to my NIkon SLR.

..

6006840060008 My wife had been researching cameras for quite some time and hinted that this is what she wanted. I then checked my BB store and found that this model had to be ordered online, which I did. Camera arrived a few days later and she is learning about it every day. Very satisfied with it and I was very impressed with the time of purchase and delivery.

..

6006840060008 I was able to be in the 2nd to last row in auditorium for my daughters Christmas Play and get close up shots. Even though she couldn't stand still for a good shot, I was able to get several photos my iphone would not have been able to get. Still learning.

..

6006840060008 This is just the camera I was looking for. I needed something that was easy to use to get the perfect shots of the kids from everything to great portraits to sports motion shots. Didn't have a lot of money to spend on an expensive camera. I also didn't really want too many features that I wasn't going to learn how to use. The picture quality is excellent and this is great a camera for someone who wants a little more quality and zoom but doesn't want to spend too much money.

..

6006840060008 Good camera for this price! I would recommend to my fiends!

..

6006840060008 This camera takes very nice picture's. Its very easy to use. Has several functions to choose from. No need to buy extra lens. The dslr world is in trouble with a camera like this out there.

..

6006840060008 You really not need more lenses as a 50X Optical + 2X digital covers most possibilities of lens needs. I Love it. Also has hot show for the Flash, and a 3" TILTING TFT-LCD, Great . . .
IT IS A GREAT CAMERA.

Capture important moments with this FUJIFILM FinePix T400 16.0-megapixel digital camera that records video with up to 1280 x 720 resolution at 30 fps for crisp, vivid images. The CCD-shift image stabilization minimizes blurring caused by camera shake.


..

6006840060008 It is a good all around camera and is compact so it fits in any pocket comfortably.

..

6006840060008 I was apprehensive about buying this camera, but since taking my first shots with it, I can't say enough good things about it. I was very impressed by the quality of the shots and the level of detail even in zoomed pictures. I take a lot of concert pictures, and provided the band is lit from the front, it works great. If your subject is lit from behind, it will struggle a bit to focus and the result isn't that great. If you have sufficient light, you will not be disappointed....well, at least I wasn't.

This digital camera features protection from water, shock, cold and dust, so you can take it on outdoor adventures. The rubber grip helps ensure you'll always have a firm hold on the camera. The 2.7" LCD is easy to see even in bright conditions.


..

6006840060008 When taking pictures at night the pics were blurry.
And the zoom feature is horrible.
Do not buy!!!

..

6006840060008 Great companion camera for those hairy situations when you don't want to risk damage to your hugely expensive digital SLRs. Has all the usual bells and whistles that make it easy to use, and the panoramic mode is especially fun.

..

6006840060008 I used it on a cruise it had clear underwater pictures in rough waters but it's difficult to turn on and it's slow. It's not bad for the price.

..

6006840060008 Bought the camera along w the extended warranty that Best Buy offers, 18 months later took the camera to Hawaii n it stopped working!

..

6006840060008 Bought the camera Jan 2012. Used it until the first time brought into a pool in September of 2012. Before I got in I very carefully check to make sure it was closed correctly. Worked for awhile and then filled up with water. Returned to factory on warranty. They sent a new one. I asked why it failed and they said it happens. First time I brought the new replacement camera into the water was July 2013. Again, I check the camera very carefully to make sure it was closed correctly. Was in the water handling the camera like an eggshell. Went two or three feet under the water and little bubble came out the top. Called Fuji, explained what happen. They said its past the one year warranty. Said I could pay to have it fixed.
Before the water ruined it, the camera was terrible. On auto, exposure is too low inside or outside. Takes five seconds for first picture, so candid shots impossible. Even when people are posing, they are wondering why haven't you taken the picture yet. If anyone is not standing very still they will be blurry. Camera struggles to find focus. 25% of the time or more the picture is out of focus.

..

6006840060008 Planning a trip to hawaii and wanted a do it all camera. Chose this over a go pro because the price is great and it has a viewing screen. I tested this camera three times underwater in a pool. With good lighting conditions, the pictures come out great. Otherwise, it's equivalent to a bad camera phone at night. I reached the bottom of a 12ft pool and it still recorded and took pictures with no problem. Above water level, it takes great shots and crisp video. The panorama function is inmpressive compared to the one found on my galaxy note 2 and old kodak point and shoot. The camera also has the ability to keep the flash on indefinitely so you can use it while recording a video. I am very impressed with this camera. Just make sure you keep the switches on the memory card and battery door in the locked position. It does have the tendency to open easily but you'll be fine as long as its properly locked.

..

6006840060008 Overall good camera for the $. I had a waterproof Olympus in the past and it didn't last too long. This one seems much sturdier takes good quality pics and video. It takes a while to turn on and shuts off by itself quickly. Battery has decent life. Used mine for 4 days before I had to charge it. Love the charger, no cords to get in the way.

..

6006840060008 I have 3 cameras. This is the camera I take when we are on the river, at the water park or the pool. I wouldn't have captured as many memories as I have without this waterproof camera. I use to have to stay dry on the sidelines to take photos, but now I jump right in the water with the action. I also like its size. It fits in my pocket, or I latch it to my belt loop. I like to think of this camera as my sports camera, but to be honest it isn't fast enough to take action shots. I'm going to upgrade to a Fujifilm XP60 simply for the burst shooting feature. Oh, I do love the battery also. I can recharge it on the wall outlet, and it last for several days of picture taking-over 600 pics and several videos easy. But I wish it had a longer zoom without adding bulk to the camera.

..

6006840060008 I am a professional scrapbooker...don't want to ever miss a GREAT MOMENT...but realistically can not always SAFELY carry a professional camera..this works out !!!

..

6006840060008 bought camera for trip to punta cana worked great, worked better than my dads more expensive camera and for the price would have spent more on disposable cameras to take the amount of pics we did.

With a water-, shock-, dust-, sand- and freeze-resistant design, this Fujifilm FinePix XP60 16.0-megapixel digital camera provides the durability needed to withstand use in the elements. The 1920 x 1080p video mode lets you shoot high-definition footage.


..

6006840060008 Perfect camera for the average user. Good "bang for the buck". The drop and water resistance capabilities allows for less worries.

..

6006840060008 I bought this camera because we are always outdoors and with now 2 kiddos it has to be water and shock proof. I have used it in the pool and at the beach and it has worked great. The only bad thing I can say about it is the battery compartment. You have to make sure you lock it right because sometimes it closes but if it doesn't click then its not properly closed. Overall I like the camera

..

6006840060008 Was a birthday present for my 10 year old granddaughter. First time out she took to Disneyland and got great pictures. Easy to use, great picture resolution. She took pictures while on ride and they were in focus. Color was accurate.

..

6006840060008 It's a waste of money.
I bought this camera for the waterproof feature. My family and I spend a lot of time in the river over the summer. The picture quality wasn't what I was hoping for and I shelved the camera over the winter. When I brought it back out, the battery charged properly, but the camera refuses to turn on. I was extremely careful and followed the directions to a T, so I know there is no water damage and I didn't bump it on anything. Right now I'm in a pickle because I paid cash for it, the best buy I bought it at failed to put the purchase on my account, and since it's been 10 months I don't have the original receipt. So far it's been a huge waste of time and money. I recommend finding a different brand of camera altogether.

..

6006840060008 first used this on a cruise, very impressed with the results using the auto setting - easy to switch to beach, underwater, night, etc
the underwater video was incredibly clear with true colors
very satisfied

..

6006840060008 I got two of these for the kids. They are easy to use and very strong.

..

6006840060008 Bought the camera for a recent vacation to capture moments from our cruise. It worked for about 15 photos then went black screen. Didn't get any photos of our vacation. Upon return, best buy stated return policy is only 14 days. So I'm stuck with a camera that doesn't work. It was sent off for repair but no info for over a week.

..

6006840060008 Was great I give it a 9 ..I like how small It is and it fits in any bag I put it in.water proof is good .

..

6006840060008 i have worked in very harsh environment's that most digital cameras could not withstand the abuse. this camera can.

..

6006840060008 We bought this for use on a trip to Hawaii. It performs as advertised but if you have big fingers it is a bit too small. Overall there are a lot of options, but many are buried under multiple menus. Overall works great as advertised.

Outdoor enthusiasts, we've mapped every hill and valley for your next great adventure. Now with more detail than ever, TOPO U.S. 100K covers the finer points of the outdoors, with topographic maps comparable to 1:100,000 scale USGS maps. TOPO U.S. 100K includes terrain contours, topo elevations, summits, parks, coastlines, rivers, lakes and geographical points.


..

6006840060008 This topo map is of little value in a hand-held unit because the resolution is too high. If you descend to the level of a geocache search, you are below the level of the topographic markings. Also, the shading and appearance of the map is useful only at very high elevations.

..

6006840060008 
This microSD card provides detailed maps of Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio with topographical and hydrographical detail that is ideal for hunting, hiking or camping trips. The search function allows you to locate points of interest.


..

6006840060008 Was told by Garmin rep. that I needed to purchase Topo 24k Great Lakes in order to navigate through the trails in the Huron National Forest in MI. Total waste of money, does not recognize 99% of the trails. Do not buy for ATV trail riding/navigation.

This environmentally friendly LCD monitor is both Energy-Star and EPEAT Gold certified. Along with an energy-saving Eco Mode, the monitor offers impressive image quality with a 16:9 aspect ratio, 5ms response time and 20,000,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio. The wall-mountable monitor features a Kensington security slot, user-friendly graphical OSD menu and direct-insert horizontal connectors.


..

6006840060008 I was on travel and my laptop display failed. I went to the Best Buy to buy a temporary fix (another monitor). This monitor was inexpensive and fit the bill. It doesn't have the resolution of the laptop but allowed me to use my laptop. When I returned home, I plugged it into the desktop computer as a second monitor and it is very handy.
For a low cost secondary monitor it is perfect and will work in a pinch as an external monitor for your laptop.

..

6006840060008 I'd keep shopping if I were you! The picture just doesn't look LED quality. Have seen better now that I have this one.

..

6006840060008 For the price this monitor is better than expected. Graphics work well, only downside is the lack of usb connections to connect peripherals.

..

6006840060008 If you want t a basic monitor that woks get this one.
If you are looking for a very good monitor then buy something else.

..

6006840060008 Kept going off at random times. Also, it can not be tilted for better viewing.

..

6006840060008 I purchased this unit to replace a monitor that had failed. The intended use is for e-mail, word processing and Internet browsing. I had to return the first AOC monitor I purchased due to a defective on-off switch. The second one works well for the intended purpose. The fact that the on-off switch was defective right out of the box makes me wonder about AOC's quality control.

..

6006840060008 I bought this as a stand in monitor for a mac and had to return it the quality was so poor, resolution is terrible, colours are washed out and no tilt, feels like it was made from the same plastic they use for crisp packets, returned it for a hp 22inch for only 40 more and the difference is incredible, for a few extra quid you will get something a lot lot better..

Tote your effects processors, recording equipment and sound modules with this Gator Cases rolling 3U rack bag that features nylon material for a durable design. A retractable handle and recessed wheels allow simple mobility.


..

6006840060008 I have used a lot of cases over the years but this is my first soft sided rack case. I'm extremely pleased with every aspect of the product. It allows me to provide power conditioning with a Furman for both my effects unit and my amp. All I need to grab for a gig is my amp and this rolling bag (which allows me room to pack a couple of stomp boxes and cords) and I got everything I need without overloading my car or breaking my back. Totally worth every penny.

..

6006840060008 
Play back video and photos directly on your camera with this detachable LCD screen that features an integrated speaker with volume control.


..

6006840060008 The LCD bacpac gives a great view of what the camera is seeing. It also makes menu adjustments much easier than using the small screen on the front of the camera.

..

6006840060008 Nice to have. The new HERO 3 comes with wi-fi. You will be able to use your smartphone to see what you are recording without having to buy this. However, you won't be able to use your smartphone underwater so this is nice to have in certain situations and environments. You can also playback pictures and videos while using this item.

..

6006840060008 We love our Go Pro and have been using it to make sailing videos and golf videos but now our video quality has really doubled since having the screen bac-pac addition because we can actually see what it is we are recording and we can be sure to get the shots we are going for.

..

6006840060008 I mostly use my GoPro to take pictures of my weekends with my family. Before I would just point and click and hope I had a cool shot. Now with the BacPac, I can see what I am shooting, I can reveiw my pics and videos right there on the spot. and makes it easier to toggle throught all of GoPro's settings. AWESOME!

..

6006840060008 Bought this for my friend since he has the GoPro cam but needed this piece to complete the set. No complaints.

..

6006840060008 Got the product to increase the function ability for the go pro. Love it. Makes recording videos alot easier. Although its great for viewing and stuff, it kills the battery life and makes it die faster. It also increases the weight and makes the go pro bulky but its still manageable. Overall i like it enough to keep it. I just wished it had easier access to the menu instead of clicking through a bunch of stuff to get to the view/playback screen.

..

6006840060008 I am using this with a gopro hero hd, I taped continuously for just over an hour with the screen in place and not one bit of trouble. It requires the most updated firmware from GoPro but that was a very short process including downloading the video manager program. The video manager program will tell you if you need an update but the directions are clear on how to do it.

..

6006840060008 Works well, video looks good. very handy. Kind of expensive. This is the only way to see what you're doing with the GoPro, on the go. The set-up gets bulky, and you need to use the expanded cases to fit. LCD uses lots of battery.

..

6006840060008 great accessory for the camera since you actually get to see what you are filming

..

6006840060008 OK, the major short-coming of the GoPro is not having a way to see how you are framing your shots. This does exactly that, and then you can remove it to get more battery life. As stated, no need for a better quality LCD since you can't focus the camera. It's good enough for what you need it for. Anything better would just cost more. It is nice and durable, attaches easily, and comes with an extended back for making it fit. Go GoPro!

..

6006840060008 
The 11.0MP digital still resolution and Protune video mode of this GoPro Hero3 camera make it easy to capture high-quality photos and videos. Built-in Wi-Fi allows you to control the camera from a compatible device or Wi-Fi remote (not included).


..

6006840060008 You can take HD videos like the Pro's underwater, in the snow, at dusty sports, in the rain or where ever you want because the camera is protected in a strong plastic housing. The camera is easy to remove and it charges with a USB cable.

..

6006840060008 My son wanted one for the past two years. We bought the GoPro Silver this Christmas which is the middle priced unit, but has all the functionality my son needs.

..

6006840060008 Bought it to take pictures of the grandkids....and it does a great job. The problem seems to be trying to keep it charged, connecting to a TV and editing the video.
I will have the camera fully charged and put away. I go to use it a day or two later and it might work....or it's dead....and needs recharged.
The original mini- HDMI to HDMI I was sold was not the correct one. Went to the store and spent an hour getting one to work there. Purchased it, got it home and tried it....didn't work. I'm used to hooking up my laptop to the TV and have no problem doing so. Not totally hopeless doing some things.
I downloaded an editing program recently but need to spend some time learning more about it.
I wish companies would spend the additional money to include a manual instead of having to find everything online.

..

6006840060008 Very easy to use and the price was right too. Recommend getting other mounts also.

..

6006840060008 THIS GOPRO IS GREAT FOR THE ON THE GO SHOTS THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO GET WITH ANOTHER TYPE OF CAMERA. IF YOU WANT ACTION AND ADVENTURE SHOTS THIS IS THE DEVICE FOR YOU.

..

6006840060008 Bought this for my husband. He does MB races and is always watching his buddies GoPro videos. Now we watch his videos. He loves it!!!

..

6006840060008 The go pro is a great camera. The early ones were the worst with sound quality. This one has greatly improved but is still not fully there. The functionality of the app for smart phones makes it so easy to use and make sure that you are getting the right shot.

..

6006840060008 If you are going to do extreme sports buy this camera. But for anything else it is not worth it. $200 + 70 (back panel [so you can see what you are actually doing]) + more for the mount + this + that, you know what I mean and let's not talk about the "one" button for everything. Don't get me wrong it is a good camera but expensive and not practical for normal user.

..

6006840060008 Great camera for athletic teens. Easy to use. I recommend it.

..

6006840060008 Got these for gifts and they loved them. takes great videos and are easy to use.Can't wait to see what they do with them next!

..

6006840060008 
Enhance your video and photo capture capabilities with this GoPro Hero3 CHDHE-302 camera that offers up to 5.0MP digital still resolution and features built-in Wi-Fi for controlling the camera from a compatible device or Wi-Fi remote (not included).


..

6006840060008 Great camera for someone that wants to capture their adventures. The small size is very convenient. And the waterproof case is an added bonus.

..

6006840060008 bought this for my daughter - she loves it - used it for water sports on Jamaican vacation.

..

6006840060008 I loved everything about the camera, including the wi-fi feature. The only downside is that if you forget to turn off the wi-fi it will drain your battery. The battery life is OK but I wish it would be a little better but will most likely call for a bigger case, so the size it is now is great.

..

6006840060008 I really like this camera. It is easy to use and very versatile with all the different accessories. I love the playback on a phone feature. The accessories are expensive and the lighting is a somewhat poor, otherwise a great camera.

..

6006840060008 Bought it as a gift for young teenager. Easy to use and durable.

..

6006840060008 all around it's a great camera but taking photos it's not very well but for video its great if it had a zoom probably be a better camera.

..

6006840060008 Great for adventure and everything outdoors. So many accessories and attachments for this little camera. So many Professional athletes even use and love this camera.

..

6006840060008 works great and battery life much better with battery bacpac

..

6006840060008 We had a great time with our gopro's. My clients love wearing then while participating in all of the events we had set up.

..

6006840060008 I use this camera for my pilot training to review my flights and lessons. It works absolutely fabulously! I highly recommend it!

..

6006840060008 
Protect your HERO3 or HERO3+ Edition camera on land and the water with this GoPro AHDRH-301 replacement housing that features a waterproof design up to 197' to allow you to capture sharp, dazzling images above and below the water.


..

6006840060008 this is the standard accessory, the price is reasonable

..

6006840060008 Case works great and is reasonably priced to allow ownership of a spare case.

Hamilton Beach Big Mouth 14 Cup Food Processor (70570) - 3 Speed - 500 W Motor


..

6006840060008 I apologize but all I can say is it serves it's purpose very well

..

6006840060008 Due to the short bowl shaft that covers the shaft for the blade, any slightly liquid material overflows out of the large capacity bowl all over the machine and counter. Also there are many seams the way the food processor is constructed and all the stuff gets stuck in the seams. I called Hamilton Beach directly and was told that the food processor was not meant to hold any liquid type ingredient. SO BEWARE if you plan on using it for other than solids.

..

6006840060008 I like the different speeds And the large size and the large opening

..

6006840060008 I really like this thing! A real workhorse and easy clean up. Makes cole slaw in a snap!

..

6006840060008 Great machine and very well worth the price. I wasn't sure how much I'd use one so didn't want to put out big bucks. This one does it all! I wanted the French fry blade but wasn't listed but indeed, it came packaged with one. The suction cups really have suction, it's a breeze to clean and looks pretty impressive on the kitchen counter!

Hamilton Beach Big Mouth 67650A Electric Juicer - Black


..

6006840060008 I was just looking for a basic juicer and this one fits the bill. It comes apart easily for cleaning, however the filter is somewhat difficult to clean. It has been great so far.

..

6006840060008 TRYING THIS AND WORKS FINE. OF COURSE YOU DONT WANT TO STUFF EVERYTHING THAT'S BIG AND DONT FORCE IT SO IT DOESNT BREAK!

..

6006840060008 I was looking for an inexpensive juicer since did I want to invest in a more expensive one. Pulls juice of out fruits and veggies easily and to the max. The pulp that remains is dryer than that of other juicers I've tried. Easy to set up and easy to clean. I have recommended to several friends.

..

6006840060008 Xcellent product for the price,only complaint is i don't fell like I get most of the juice out of certain things like fruit but for the value it's a great juicer!!!

..

6006840060008 I wanted to start off small for my first juicer and after reading all of its reviews, I decided to go with this one. Everything was great until it stopped working a few weeks after I purchased it. I'm guessing it was the motor that went. I didn't want to buy another one, I upgraded to the Breville juicer( the one in the Joe Cross documentary-fat, sick and nearly dead) and I haven't had any issues thus far.

..

6006840060008 We bought this 2 months ago, and still have a blast making new juices and coming up with new recipes! This thing rocks

..

6006840060008 I love my juicer, it works great and cleans up easy.

..

6006840060008 This juicer is very easy to use and assemble. I love it!

..

6006840060008 I have made many different types of juice! Great flavor!

..

6006840060008 Great product for the price. Very well satisfied except that it is bulkier than we thought.

Breakfast They say breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Unfortunately, mornings are hectic for most people, especially families with children. So how do you cope with hunger pangs at breakfast time? If you're like most people, you have to rush through the meal, gobble down whatever's handy in the kitchen, or grab a quick, on-the-go bite.That's where the Breakfast Sandwich Maker by Hamilton Beach comes to the rescue. It's all about making a fresh breakfast sandwich you can grab and go. Just choose your bread and layer on the fixings: egg, cheese, precooked meat, or the ingredients of your choice. In five minutes or less, your perfectly assembled breakfast sandwich is ready to eat. You can customize your breakfast sandwich with a practically endless variety of fresh ingredients. Now you know why everyone who loves breakfast sandwiches wants this product in their kitchen!


..

6006840060008 Cool machine...fun to use....one step process without making a mess in the kitchen....kids love it!

..

6006840060008 The maker works wonderfully in making english muffins with eggs, cheese and any meat (sausage patties work best). Has it for three months. But, this week it just stopped working. Nothing happened. Just stopped working. Will try to get warranty repair, but as this price, not sure if it's worth mailing it in.

..

6006840060008 Great for a quick hot breakfast on the go
Great space saver.
Easy to assemble . Quick cleanup.

..

6006840060008 I can't say anything negative because it really is a useful item

..

6006840060008 I would recommend this sandwich maker to everyone.
It came highly recommend to me.

..

6006840060008 Great and easy way to make breakfast sandwiches. I have no problems with it and will be purchasing more for gifts!

..

6006840060008 This is a great buy! it is a great sandwich maker that is very easy to use and you can make a great breakfast sandwich in a matter of 5 minutes. It is easy to clean as well. I simply love it!

..

6006840060008 This is the easiest small kitchen appliance to use PLUS it makes a great sandwich.

..

6006840060008 This is a cool way to make an egg mc muffin & know the ingredients are what you want & not some processed junk. You do need to wait a few minutes between sandwiches because the heat for the egg drops. Will have to leave the top up for a couple minutes so the egg will cook & the bread won't burn.
My 7 year old grandson thought it was neat so this gets a thumbs up!

..

6006840060008 My husband loves this product. He makes breakfast sandwiches for all of us and they are delicious. He wishes that they would make a double sandwich maker.

..

6006840060008 
How does a coffeemaker work without a carafe? Quite well, thank you. Instead of pouring from a carafe, you just press your cup against the button to fill up. To keep coffee tasting fresh, the BrewStation coffee maker has an insulated tank and a gentle warming heater to keep coffee hot without scorching the flavor. Your last cup tastes as fresh as the first.


..

6006840060008 This product works wonderfully for me. I make coffee for a living and I really enjoy the coffee and iced coffee it produces! For the price I wasn't expecting anything grand but i was pleasantly surprised.

..

6006840060008 Was unable to return, no I would not purchase this coffee maker again, Not what I expected, I had the 4 cup and this is totally different.

..

6006840060008 Had another coffee maker that kept breaking parts off of it. I like that it does not have a carafe and dispenses one cup at a time with out The more expensive individual servings of coffee.

..

6006840060008 I bought this to replace a 10 year old electric percolator that finally died Was not sure of the after drinking perc coffee for so long Man I have to tell you why did I wait This unit uses less coffee and brews it stronger If you like it good and strong throw a extra scoop or two and set on bold Great machine for the money

..

6006840060008 
Modern look, same delicious coffee tasteNothing beats a cup of cafe-quality coffee at sunrise. No matter if you are brewing coffee for one as you head to work, or for your whole family on a weekend morning, we have a stylish Hamilton Beach Stainless Steel Coffee Maker with the ideal size, features and design for your coffee needs.Hamilton Beach offers you a wide variety of stainless steel coffee makers: single cup , 10-12 cup, the BrewStation line with unique one-hand dispensing, and even a full line of stainless coffee percolators for the old-school coffee lovers out there. If you are seeking an attractive, stainless steel coffee maker with great features and delicious, fresh-brewed coffee taste, Hamilton Beach is the right choice for you.


..

6006840060008 This is our third Hamilton Beach Coffee Maker. We love the no carafe design. The old one was working fine, but slow, and we had let it get pretty gunked up, so decided that at the $40 price we could make the purchase of a new one. We especially like the container that you fill with water and then just "plug" in to the unit. That was my only complaint on the old model - too many spills and a narrow slot to pour water in. The new coffee maker has solved this problem and still has the other features we loved on the old one.

..

6006840060008 I am very satisfied with this coffee maker, it is easy to operate and makes good coffee. It is pleasant to the eyes . I am dissapointed that I cannot clean the internal parts, filter basket and coffee chamber in the Dishwasher, but it is still a good unit for my purposes.

..

6006840060008 The settings are easy to do. The lift off and fill tank are great and easy to put on and off. I like the flat bottom filters. Easy to fill. The dispenser makes it fast and easy to get that first cup in the morning. No mess!

..

6006840060008 Easy to fill the water container; easy to fill your cup with no glass carafe to break; keeps coffee hot (you can program it to stay warm up to 4 hours).
We love it soooo much we bought a second one to have as a backup just in case something happens to it. Usually when I find a product I love and I have to replace it, it' slither been modified or discontinued. Didn't want to risk that with this great coffee pot!

..

6006840060008 Will not last long. Cheap plastic. Took 10 loads to get the plastic taste out.
Side fill is very good feature.
I would pay a lot more for a complete unit made out of stainless steel!
Design is very good!

..

6006840060008 Great coffeemaker. Easy to use and looks good on the counter. Sleek design.

..

6006840060008 This is a great coffee pot for the price. No worries of a carafe, just fill your cup and go.

..

6006840060008 THIS IS A GREAT COFFEE POT- I BOUGHT THE EARLIER VERSION AND USED IT TIL I BROKE THE HINGE OFF THE LID- I WAS REALLY GLAD TO SEE THERE WAS A NEWER VERSION THAT IS MORE DURABLE AND EVEN EASIER TO USE THAN THE OLD VERSION. NO MORE POTS TO LIFT OUT AND POUR- JUST PLACE YOUR CUP OR LARGE TUMBLER AND AS EASY AS 1-2-3 COFFEE IS IN IT WITHOUT ANY MESS!!

..

6006840060008 No pot to clean or burn. Makes good coffee. Like the removable water tank. Coffee could be a little hotter, but overall happy.

..

6006840060008 Easy to use. I really like the water reservoir, not too many things to take apart early in the morning. Makes good coffee for price. I mainly bought it for the dispenser, great for grabbing a cup out the door.

6006840060008 I am disappointed that the clock won't keep time no matter how often we correct it. We can't set it to make coffee before we wake because of this. I will be returning it.

This Hamilton Beach Power Deluxe 64699 stand mixer delivers 275W peak power to help ensure your recipe's ingredients are thoroughly mixed. The 6 speeds can work through many batters and doughs, and the mixer unlocks from the stand for handheld use.


..

6006840060008 beaters don't reach bottom of the mixing bowl and the bowl does not turn automatically when mixing. Beaters are hard to remove for cleaning

..

6006840060008 It's a basic simple mixer easy to use, attach or dettatch from its stand. The glass bowl is great ! The base dish will rotate and there's the manual button that can move the dish and bowl from center to closer to the edges to mix the stuff better. Light mixer if you want to go handmix.
It's not an all grown up mixer, but I bake quite often and those do the job fine.

..

6006840060008 to date I really like my kettle. I read reviews on amazon but bought from best buy. I would recommend reading the programming instructions. If I could change anything it would be the way you set the clock and timer. It takes a bit to do and if you need to unplug which is recommend when not being used you have to start all over, would be nice if they could add a batter spot that would hold the time, timer and temp setting. Other wise I love this kettle. heats up fast, ( a full pot about 5 min) I will note that if you are a light sleeper and your bedrooms are close to the kitchen you will hear the kettle turn on, its not very quiet, but we have gotten use to it. I also like to programmable temp for tea, hot coco ... and the heating element is not exposed. over all I am happy with the kettle .

..

6006840060008 I really, really liked this kettle it made warming water for tea so easy for me. I could walk away and if I got busy it didn't matter because I didn't boil away all the water and burn the pot. This was so great for me that I bought two of them, one for my vacation home.
However! This kettle only lasted 2 months at my vacation home and then it quit. I hope the other one lasts longer when I return. Maybe this was just a defective one but I see one other review saying the same. Such a good appliance but....

..

6006840060008 I love the preset temps that I can set with a few pushes of a button, allowing me to brew different varieties of loose-leaf tea at the optimum temperature! Super quick heating time too!

..

6006840060008 The kettle is easy to setup and use. It heats up and keeps the water fairly hot for an hour. It doesn't keep it at boiling but after an hour it is still close enough that a short boil (less than a minute) brings it back to boiling. I liked it so well that I bought it for a Christmas present for my sister.

..

6006840060008 I bought this on 8/26 and today is 10/11. The kettle gave up on me a little over a month. Wasn't happy at all. I at least was able to get another type of kettle.

..

6006840060008 Design is good, pours easily, no spilling.
The different temperature settings are nice since I drink a lot of green tea.
I like that it doesn't shut off immediately once boiling temperature is reached but keeps boiling about 30 seconds longer. Those who don't like that can turn if off before it shuts off automatically.
I cannot rate durability yet for I just got it a couple of weeks ago.
Advise before first use: boil and discard the water about twice as often as recommended in instructions, after that the funny smell will be gone.

..

6006840060008 I love this kettle! I had been researching variable temp kettles for some time, and they all were over $100 and had enough bad reviews to make me skeptical. I came across this one and for the price and free shipping it can't be beat! I especially love that I can program it to turn on at specified times so my hot water can be waiting for me in the morning (I don't like to wait for coffee....). My only complaint is that, after being unplugged, I need to reprogram the time and auto on time. Really not a big deal. I love love love this kettle! Don't yet know about the durability because I've only had it a few weeks

..

6006840060008 i've had it for about a month and have no complains so far
it's great to be able to use both C and F scales as well as setting custom temperatures
there are other brands that do the same, maybe even cheaper but everyone seems to have a complaint about all of them, usually due to cheap materials and poor manufacturing
i took a chance with this and so far I'm pleased

Hamilton Beach Programmable Thermal 10 Cup Coffee Maker (49855) - Yes - 10 Cup(s) - Metallic - Plastic


..

6006840060008 This coffeemaker didn't even last a month! Went to make coffee and it won't even turn on. Completely dead!

..

6006840060008 Coffee does not get hot, pot leaks easily when pouring, have to really shove the lid into place, which given how the lid is constructed, feels like it will eventually break or leak anyway

Hamilton Beach Smoothie Smart Blender (56222) - 700 W - 1.25 quart


..

6006840060008 This blender works awesome. I use it everyday with no issues. My only issue is the lid is hard to snap off.

..

6006840060008 
Hamilton Beach Stand Mixer (63327) - 3.50 quart - 6 Speed(s)


..

6006840060008 This is a very good product for people learning how to bake for the first time, and it's also at a very reasonable price .

..

6006840060008 Overall I think this is a good value. If you're not planning on using it all that often and don't want to invest the kind money for an upper end mixer then this is a good choice.

..

6006840060008 I'm not a heavy baker, so I don't need a mixer that often. But on occasions that I do, I wanted one that does the job. This is an awesome mixer for the price. The flat beater gets great coverage around the bowl while mixing. I found that you have to tilt the head up to add additional ingredients, but that's no big deal. Overall, nice mixer.

..

6006840060008 I got this mixer for Mothers Day and I love it! It is great for cakes and baking. It comes with three attachments, very easy to use.

..

6006840060008 Great product and price. I use it to bake cakes every week.

..

6006840060008 I was hesitant about buying this item after reviews on other websites. I'm so glad I made this choice. Great stand mixer without the expensive price tag, excellent for baking just like the kitchen aid. I loved it.

..

6006840060008 this is a great mixer, works just like a kitchen aid! stands up to thick bread doughs, cookies, anything i throw at it! LOVE IT!!

..

6006840060008 I used it once to make a cake. I am not a heavy user. I was tired of using a handheld when I wanted to bake. I like the style of the mixer and most importantly, it gets the job done. No complaints.

Designed to accommodate up to a 7-lb. chicken or a 5-lb. roast, this Hamilton Beach Stay or Go 33472 7-quart slow cooker features a clip-tight sealed lid to help prevent spills while you're on the go.


..

6006840060008 We were looking to upgrade from a 5 qt slow cooker to something larger with a "warm" setting. The hinged lid design got my attention, and after investigating reviews and checking one in a store, I was convinced. It's perfect for carrying and setting on a buffet line - everyone else is looking for a place to set their lid! We have already used it every week since we got it.

..

6006840060008 I was excited to use this for my growing family and for bringing food to other locations. I used it once, everything was great. The next time I plugged it in, nothing happened. Tried different outlets, etc. Nothing worked.
The worst part is that my husband threw away the box so I'm stuck with a useless piece of equipment.

..

6006840060008 Got this as a Christmas gift for my wife. The handle on the lid of her previous slow cooker was breaking. She wanted a larger cooker that also had a locking lid. She had not seen this model and style before and was pleasantly surprised. She was even happier when she used it the first time. The 7 quart capacity is just a little larger than our previous unit. This model also fit in the cloth case that we had from the previous unit, to keep it from collecting dust when not in use. Overall we are pleased and hope that the hinges and other parts hold up over time.

..

6006840060008 Bought this a month or so ago and have used it 5 times so far. The size is great for my family of 5. Everything I have cooked in it has been great. The best thing about it is the lid that keeps in the steam. It is also great for transporting. No worries of the lid popping off and your food going flying.

..

6006840060008 I really wanted to replace my older slow cooker with one that had a warm setting the added portability and being able to lift the lid with out removing it is really nice!

..

6006840060008 This slowcooker works great and the hinged lockdown lid is a fantastic idea. a true cook and go product, cooking temps are spot on.

Hamilton Beach Wave Crusher Blender (58143) - 700 W - 1.25 quart


..

6006840060008 Great blender. The lighter weight pitcher makes for easier handling. Pour spout is great. Easy second hatch for additions while blending. Lid engineered so that drips fall back into the pitcher. Quieter than my 20+ year, second hand model. The only drawback is that the lid fits so well it is hard to pry off.

..

6006840060008 Is a nice shape blender, price is very good, does the job as expected.

..

6006840060008 Wow the price was great for this blender. Works so much better than my old one. Quick as can be. Easy clean up too

..

6006840060008 so far so good....every blender ive had never chops ice, and never mixes ingredients well..

..

6006840060008 This blender and similar I have owned (having the spicket type spout) are very good for daily general use. It does not do ice quite as well a a more powerful one, but eventually grinds it up.

..

6006840060008 If you are looking for a blender under 50 bucks that does a good job at blending fruits and vegetabes, this is the one to get. It has a nice glass picher with great pour spot and comes in black.

..

6006840060008 It is a good blender for it's price. The glass contain makes it easy to clean.
The blade is sharp. Really a powerful tool.
But it is a little bit too noisy when use.
All in all, good for the price.

..

6006840060008 FOR THE PRICE OF THIS BLENDER, YOU CANNOT DO BETTER. AMAZON SELLS IT FOR LESS BUT BB MET THE LOWER PRICE. FREE SHIPPING TO STORE NEAR YOU. BRAND NEW ITEM- LOOKED BRAND NEW.
GREAT REVIEWS ON AMAZON AND GREAT WARRANTY. TOO CHEAP FOR YOU- GO SPEND $300 AND BE DISAPPOINTED.

..

6006840060008 We tried this for Smoothies and other stuff and it just not run at all

..

6006840060008 I love this blender. Its awesome for making smoothies. It has an awesome lid never seen it on other blenders. Cable storage. Strong glass. Good price!

Powerful and versatile yet easy to use. The Harman Kardon AVR 1700 has virtually everything that you want in an audio/video receiver. Do you want sheer power? The AVR 1700 has 100 watts per channel. Want a variety of entertainment sources? The receiver includes vTuner Internet radio, DLNA 1.5 and AirPlay for wireless reception of your music and HDMI inputs for DVDs, HDTV, Blu-ray Disc media and video games. How about a system that's easy to use? A mobile app, remote control and intuitive menu system offer sheer simplicity. With all of these features and famously superb Harman Kardon audio, the AVR 1700 offers spectacular entertainment.


..

6006840060008 For my needs this was to be a nice product. It had a nice sound to my ears, and handled all of my AV needs.
I fought with it a long time to be able to use the AirPlay feature as it was difficult to setup, and required several reboots of the receiver to get working. This was the primary reason I purchased this over other offerings.
Other than that it worked well for 1 year. Then it would only go to a flashing amber light when powered on. Trying to work with their support has been a nightmare. I doubt I will ever resolve this or reach any type of satisfactory solution.
Unless something amazing happens in the future I doubt I will be purchasing their products again.

Listen to your Bluetooth-equipped device's audio through a compatible home entertainment system with this Harman Kardon BTA 10 Bluetooth adapter that memorizes up to 8 different devices, so you can quickly access your music.


..

6006840060008 I bought one BTA10 unit (GG0038-0036424), were able to pair it with an Iphone 4 but could not do it with a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. What do you recommend?
Is the BTA10 able to connect to the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3?
Thanks.

..

6006840060008 Documentation says it works up to 33 feet but if I move more than 3 feet away from it, it begins to cut out. Disappointed.

Get ready to sink some battleships with this Hasbro 38194 Deluxe Battleship: movie edition game, which includes 5 Navy ships and 5 alien ships for hours of play as commander of the alien fleet or the human fleet.


..

6006840060008 Though we did not actually purchase the game from Best Buy i still thought it would be helpful to review. The game is as fun, and easy as the classic, except for set-up. Little kids under about 12 have problems, because you have to enter each of your ships into the computer rather than just playing. Sure you don't have to use those features, but they could have made the game simply sense the ships at that premium cost. Has many game modes, and features. I have been playing one player against the computer, and it is actually pretty fun.

..

6006840060008 I thought it was overpriced. It was easy to put together. It was hard to get the game started and also very repiticious. i guess it had to follow the movie but very drawen out and tedious. I would not recommend it, if you want to play battle ship buy the original cuz this electronic version is not worth it.

Breathe in fresh air with the help of this Heaven Fresh HF 210UV portable ionic air purifier, which features electrostatically charged dust-collection plates to trap pollutants. Germicidal UV light helps create a healthy environment.


..

6006840060008 I've had a few air purifiers in my life and they all have a couple settings for low and high. This does as well, but it doesn't move air out of of the machine, the fans inside don't blow hard enough even on high to blow out a cigarette lighter. I've only had for less than a month but still on the fence.

Easily integrate your 11" Apple MacBook Air and peripheral devices with this Henge Docks HD01VB11MBA docking station that features a vertical design to help save space. USB and Mini DisplayPort interfaces allow wide-ranging connectivity.


..

6006840060008 The concept and the look of the Henge Dock is wonderful. Clean lines, takes up small space on desktop and then computer is also taking up small space on desktop.
But Henge Dock did not work; had only two (2) USB ports; and no on/off switch (to turn computer on/off at end of day you would have to take it out of Henge Dock and then again take it out of Henge Dock to turn it on).
I returned it to store.

Compose custom mixes with this Hercules DJ Console RMX 2 4780729 2-deck DJ controller, which features 2 jog wheels, 8 velocity pads and high-resolution faders for simple operation. The 24-bit/96kHz high-resolution audio ensures production of lush sound.


..

6006840060008 Really a great product, all functions and set up were straight forward. Would recommend it for a novice or semi-pro DJ.

..

6006840060008 First off I want to say I love this product. I have been a DJ for 18 years now and have used many products. I have owned the original RMX for studio mixing so I wouldn't have to connect my turntables and I was not pleased at all with the original RMX. I was going to purchase a pioneer DDJ-SX but didn't want to lose the functionality of my turntables I love so much. I ended up connecting my turntables to the RMX2 with Virtual DJ 7 Pro and it is amazing. I can use my turntables in timecode mode, switch to play regular vinyls and use it as a controller all at once. I used to have a M-Audio Trigger finger mapped to trigger all my cue points, effects, etc.. but the RMX 2 takes care of that all. The cross fader is a little short but It can be adjusted in the settings. I also have an external mixer that will override the cross fader on the RMX2. I use Virtual DJ 7 Pro and feel with video and the ability to map any device on the fly makes it superior to all other programs out there. Not to mention they were one of the first DJ programs to come out on the market. I used to use their software dating back to Atomix MP3 using webcams to control my mp3s, and back when you could only purchase the timecoded vinyls from France! I also used Serato before and it was a great software as well with awesome sound quality but I still prefer VDJ. You get a %50 discount off of Virtual DJ Pro with the purchase of the RMX 2.

Cruise to your favorite tunes with these Hifonics Atlas ATL693 3-way speakers that feature 6" x 9" injection-molded polypropylene woofer cones, 1-5/8" Mylar midranges and 3/4" silk-dome tweeters for a vibrant soundscape.


..

6006840060008 I purchased these to replace some blown factory speakers in my Saab. I have them running on a 4 channel Brutus amp along with 4 inch Atlas front speakers. These are defiantly a improvement over the factory speakers before the factory's blew out. They are clear and produce decent mid bass. I would say if your looking for something to replace some worn out factory speakers these are a great choice. But if your looking for something to really pump up your system you should look more into some Polks/Alpines/Rockford Fosgates.

..

6006840060008

Manage your weight and monitor your health with this body composition scanner that goes beyond a traditional scale with KnowledgeBook technology that measures body fat, body water, muscle and bone mass.


..

6006840060008 This product worked fine at first, but then as I continued to use it I noticed that if I weighed myself multiple times it was different every time, sometimes as much as 4 lbs different. And all the additional features as far as muscle mass, BMI, water weight, etc, doesnt tell you anthing valuable, they are just averages based on your height/weight/age. I will be returning this unfortunately.

..

6006840060008 simple to use, simple to understand. big numbers, easy to read.

..

6006840060008 I purchased the SC-565C. One of the reasons I purchased it was because the website states that it has a Lifetime warranty. When I received the product the manual stated that it only has a 10 year limited warranty. Best Buys website also states that it has 3 modes. Not true. It only has 2 modes Normal and Athlete mode. I looks like should spend more time keeping their website up to date.

..

6006840060008 I train and compete so I need to know how much water weight I have. "Athletic mode" gives me an accurate read out so I know whether to eat healthy or hit the sauna.
To get consistent read outs weigh yourself at the same time (I find the morning to be the best).
Only if you press "Power" does it take the detailed information and store it. Otherwise just step on like any normal scale for the weight.

..

6006840060008 I bought this scale about a month ago, it still works great! Very simple to use. No complaints so far. This scale comes in 2 varieties: one using AAA batteries and the other using lithium ion batteries. I strongly recommend the lithium ion batteries.

Show off your favorite digital photos on this HP DF1010P1 photo frame that features a 10" widescreen LCD and 1024 x 600 resolution for a clear, detailed display. The USB 2.0 port enables easy connection to a computer for simple file transfer.


..

6006840060008 Returned frame has really bad view angles. pictures looked great at on 1 angle.

..

6006840060008 This is a very easy to use picture frame display remote control is nice too and it looks great

..

6006840060008 Picture quality is great and the ease of use is amazing. Accepted a usb and copied files easily

..

6006840060008 Frame damaged, so I had to get a replacement. Could not get replacement to work with my MacBook Pro computer; replacement would not work per instructions in user manual, e.g., "Menu" button inoperable on frame and remote control. I had to make two trips back to Best Buy store and buy an SHDC reader just to get my photos on to digital picture frame. People I dealt with in customer service and geek squad were superior, but I only managed to get a marginal capability (less than I had on my previous digital picture frame 8 years ago). Very good service but a very poor product!

..

6006840060008 Overall it's a great concept for personal
Use in our technological world

..

6006840060008 I have always wanted a digital photo frame but I held out to get a 10 inch display and it was well worth the wait. The color and clear display of the pictures are awesome. I like the fact that I can transfer pictures from my computer on to this device and it holds a lot of pictures as well. Great product.

..

6006840060008 A great digital picture frame. Easy to use and stores photos so you can change them or set a slide show. The features, such as the clock,etc, are nice but make the menu navigation and personalization a bit confusing. Uploading photos is easy though. For the price, it is an excellent frame that gives great quality and ease of use to those who want to change pictures often.

..

6006840060008 We bought this for my sister in law and loaded it with family pictures. She and her husband are totally non tech and had no problem operating the unit. Nice picture, great size easy to set up and use

..

6006840060008 My husband bought this for me as a gift, and then had to spend hours and hours learning how to set it up so that he could present it to me with pictures in it. After, we both worked a couple of hours to figure out the best ways to use it and get pictures on it from the computer. I still don't remember how to do even the simplest thing on it when I wanted to load more pictures. Completely counter intuitive. Just to load pictures takes many multiples of pressing buttons. Horrible!

..

6006840060008 One ofseveral pictureframes. Simple anddies thejob. Nice frame

The Industry Choice in Financial Calculators. The HP 12c Financial Calculator celebrates its 30th anniversary as a trusted tool for business and financial professionals. This robust business calculator delivers powerful processing in a collector's edition package.


..

6006840060008 Great little calculator. Built solid and I expect it to last for many years.

..

6006840060008 Battery life is excellent, numerals are clear, light weight, flat form factor!
Perfect!

..

6006840060008 Good caluculator for work and personal use. Once you learn how to use the HP 12 c it's difficult to go back to using an ordinary calculator. However I question it's durability. I seem to be replacing this calculator every 2 to 3 years which is becoming very costly. I question it's duarability as the same thing keeps happening.....'it just stop working" even after replacing the battery, it doesn't work. If I didn't think the functions were so great, I would not keep replacing.

Safeguard your photos, videos, music and other important files on this HP v300a solid state drive that features an ample 240GB capacity to store your documents. The Serial ATA interface helps ensure an easy connection to your computer.


..

6006840060008 Out of box failure. HP wouldn't replace ssd because it does not have a serial number. Sent unit back for refund could not get a replacement as hp stoped making them. Look to a different brand.

..

6006840060008 First off, let me say, this SSD is fast. It sped up everything and replaced my old 20GB SSD that only held my OS. Now I can at least put a few games on this 240GB SSD and get the benefit for my games too.
However, the installation was unbearable. It was NOT plug and play. I tried to clone my 20GB with the included Acronis software. Not only did it not see the SSD, but neither did windows.
I eventually had to use windows administrative tools to go in and manually format the drive. Then I had to download a 3rd party cloning freeware tool to get it to clone. Ugh.
In the end it worked. I'm happy, but I can see the novice user throwing a fit and returning it. Try to get it to work! For the cost of this drive and the size of the drive, it's worth the headache. Not to mention you get a free 2.5 HDD enclosure with it! I used Macrium Reflect (freeware) to clone.

..

6006840060008 Would recommend for breathing life into any machine!

..

6006840060008 Great update for any Mac it was a great solution for new hard drive that I actually Wore out

..

6006840060008 Awsome for my college student. Great for web brousing and uploading and downloading data. Super fast processor and good space capacity. Recomended to allmy friends.

..

6006840060008 I bought for a HDD replacement for laptop, used the SSD in my laptop, and used the HDD with the SSD External Kit for spare drive. Also works on HP Laptops with the HP Protect Smart and HP Cool Sense Features

..

6006840060008 I got two of these to use for the drives in my RAID for my office PC update, an HP i7 desktop. I also installed an Intel SSD from Best Buy as the operating system and program drive. The whole setup is very fast and the fans never kick on in the desktop. Very quiet! I had an SSD on hand and the enclosure and USB3 cable that came with the HP drives allowed me to use the extra SSD as a transfer drive. I backed up my old RAID from the old machine onto the extra SSD, it took about an two and a half hours. I then restored the backed up files from the extra SSD to the new machine with the RAID set up with two of the HP SSDs and the restore process took ten minutes. Nice time savings! The included enclosures and cables and mounting brackets made the job a breeze.

..

6006840060008 I had too much trouble trying to get it to work correctly with my MacBook Pro so I returned it for an intel 180 gb ssd.

..

6006840060008 This item works! I installed Windows 8 on an HP 8710w with a 120GB HD. Purchased this from my local BB and followed installation procedures. In just a few minutes, the system was cloned to the SSD! I swapped the drives and WOW what a difference! No noise, fast, less heat! No problems at all! If everyone would install the max memory in their system and one of these, their old computer would perform like a new one!

AT&T; EL52200 DECT Cordless Phone - Cordless - 1 x Phone Line - 2 x Handset - Speakerphone - Answering Machine - Caller ID


..

6006840060008 I am very pleased with this AT&T phone. I needed something my wife could operate. The answering machine is "one touch:.

..

6006840060008 Love the phone great price just second base does not charge phone no biggie. Got cell phone just needed land line

..

6006840060008 We purchased this phone for several reasons, 1-price, 2-design, 3-easy set up. So far it as received A's from us across the board. It is not a fancy phone but it does have the basics in a way that was easy to set up and very easy to use. So far I have had nothing to complain about. Loving it right now!

..

6006840060008 I think maybe this phone sat on a shelf too long before I got it. The batteries in both sets do not last as long as any phone I have ever owned, (at least 5 or 6). So the great deal I got on the phone will eventually be negated when I have to buy new batteries. Other than that, I am happy with the quality all around.

..

6006840060008 I needed a new phone at a good price, and name brand

..

6006840060008 For the price and style, it can't be beat. Enjoy all the features without
any hassle or confusion

..

6006840060008 Not what I expected from ATT. It had most of the features I needed and I planned on having this for a while. Within a year all the phone batteries needed replacement. The volume faded and I ended up yelling at my callers. Calls were dropped multiple times on same call. Very disappointing.

..

6006840060008 Neat, durable phone; however, you can hardly hear the sound with the volume turned all the way up. Probably buy Panasonic or V-Tech again next time.

..

6006840060008 Phone works well, but the sound quality is not as good as I had hoped for.- words are clipped and conversation sounds like in an echo chamber. My brother said that I sounded as though I were on a cell phone. It does have nice features - answering machine, intercom, speakerphone, and caller ID, to name a few..

..

6006840060008 These phones sound great. They set up quickly and features are great.

This compact stereo system features a color-changing cabinet that adjusts to your needs with the touch of a button for just the right atmosphere and a passive subwoofer for impressive audio.


..

6006840060008 We use this device in our kitchen to stream talk radio during the day, and often take it outside on the screened in porch to listen to music in the evening from our iPhones. I love the portability and for it's size it has good sound.

..

6006840060008 This is a very cool product for my teenager. But the second day she used it, it STOPPED WORKING! I have to drive a bit to go to a Best Buy & have yet to bring it in for an exchange. I hope this particular one is a fluke.

..

6006840060008 Bought this for my daughter and she loved it! The speakers are loud and clear and she usually has the lights turned on as a night light. :)

..

6006840060008 i absolutely love this product. it emit great sound quality, and to top it all, the led colors are very cool.

..

6006840060008 This product is a great buy. The sound is good for casual listening. It is portable and small enough to go anywhere. The light changing features make it fun at times, but it can be turned off when needed. Very easy to use!!! I may need to get another one for the kids because they borrow this one all the time.

..

6006840060008 I was pleasantly surprised how good the sound quality is on this. It's very easy to use, and I like that it also charges my iPod. The changing colors are really cool, but it's also great that I can turn them off if necessary. My young nephews love watching the colors in the dark. Great product!

..

6006840060008 Got this 4 my sister for Christmas & her & her kids love it. Any time I walk in their home it's always on. The kids love the way the colors "pulse" to the beat of the music. Can't wait to get one for myself!

..

6006840060008 I bought this ipod player/docking station for my 11 year old daughter, and she really loves it! I wanted something more unique looking than the boring black or silver rectangles out there. It was super easy to use, sounds great, and she really enjoys all the different colors! Overall - great product.

..

6006840060008 I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it. The changing color was a hit. The sound is great and she uses it everyday.

..

6006840060008 I bought one for each of my kids. We were extremely surprised at the sound quaility and they found it "cool" that it had a mode to light up to the beat of the song. It also makes a great nighlight.
Great product. I am pleased.

..

The iP11 is a great looking way to listen to great sound. Wake or sleep to your favorite iPhone or iPod tunes through high fidelity neodymium driver in a specially designed Reson8 speaker chamber with EXB expanded bass circuitry. Time sync button instantly sets clock to iPhone or iPod time. Line-in jack to play any audio source.


..

6006840060008 Overall a good product, but like so many docking stations It lack in volume.

..

6006840060008 I purchased this because Best Buy advertised this product as having a remote control. I returned the first one and Customer service sent me a second one. The second one also did not have a remote control. The customer service was awful. They did not try to rectify the mistake in Bestbuy.com .
I felt that I was really dealing with "Beast" Buy.

..

6006840060008 Nothing special but if you are looking for something to charge your Apple product with good speaker quality, this is a good deal. I use this to listen to Pandora in the morning and the sound quality is pretty good.

..

6006840060008 I use this unit in my garage mostly when cooking out. I live on a busy street and the street noise is no problem with the unit. I had trouble syncing the time with my iphone but it was very easy to manualy set the time. It was exactly what I was looking for.

..

6006840060008 I had bought this IHOME thinking it would be a great purchase and last a long time... I turned out obviously to be wrong. Within about 2 months the IHOME was broken and unusable. I was frustrated and upset because there went a good $60 bucks out the window. Take my advice and be careful if you buy this product, it doesn't last the time it should.

..

6006840060008 shortly after purchase, the clock function ceased to keep correct time and the change clock time function also stopped working altogether.
emailed product contact resource for instruction on how to correct these problems
they did not provide any assistance
instead they said to return it to the seller
shortly thereafter the up and down volume functions ceased to operate
this thing is a piece of junk not worth your money or your time

..

6006840060008 This will allow you to wake up to your Ipod. Here are a couple of issues I found.
1) You can not listen to your Ipod on Shuffle for sleep mode or any mode. So your songs will always play in alphabetical order.
2)Even on the lowest setting the display is too bright. (I have to turn off the lighted display)
3) This may seem stupid, but the buttons when pressed "click". During normal time its not that big a deal, but at 3AM having to hear that click over and over cause I am turning the display on and then lower or hitting snooze is annoying.
4) No Radio
But It sounds pretty good and looks really good!. OH 1more thing DOES NOT come with adaptor plate for Ipod Nano generation 4 or below. Only generation 5. Does not tell you that. Had to order adaptor from Ihome for $5.99 for my Ipod generation 4.
Honestly, its expensive and for the price either shop around for something cheaper or fess up an extra 20 spot and get a better IHome model. Kinda wish I took mine back when I had the chance.
:-(

..

6006840060008 I bought this for my teenage son for x-mas. He recently told me, "Thanks, I really like this". It was music to my ears.

..

6006840060008 Would really like this if the LED light went one more step dimmer

..

6006840060008 Love this ihome alarm clock. perfect size for my nightstand. easy to use. sound is really loud so if you want it for parties or something u might want to buy a bigger one. sound is really good just doesn't get wicked loud. awesome item!

Enjoy quality sound on the go with these Infinity Reference X Series REF-9603IX 6" x 9" 3-way speakers that feature edge-driven soft-dome tweeters to minimize distortion and Plus One woofer cones for loud, clear audio.


..

6006840060008 Nice speakers. When I first put them in my Tundra I really did not notice a huge difference but once I broke them in for about 1-2 weeks, they really came to life. Very clear mid low to highs and very efficient, crisp sounding speakers without an amp. I'm building this system one step at a time and in the long run, considering going with powered sub or upgrade original HU (or both) to round out the low end. Feel very good that these speaker will sound even better as I upgrade other components

..

6006840060008 
These Infinity Reference X Series REF-9602IX car speakers feature a 6" x 9" Plus One woofer cone for stunning bass response and an edge-driven, soft-dome tweeter for enhanced audio clarity.


..

6006840060008 Good value for the money. I love the sound quality, and so do my friends.

..

6006840060008 They are great 6x9s. Alittle pricey but very nice.

..

6006840060008 I love these speakers. Hits all the high frequencies with no distortion and the lows are clear aswell but not really loud. Only downside to them is that I had to spend about 30 minutes fabricating my speaker mounts to make them fit. I've already had a few friends by them aswell. Get them if you want your car stereo to scream. Mine makes my ears ring :p

..

6006840060008 Get these if you're looking for some real quality speakers!

..

6006840060008 No matter what type of music you like to listen to you will love these speakers. Installed the speakers ourselves in a 2001 civic. It was extremely difficult. I would recommend if you have a vehicle like this to have it installed by a professional.

..

6006840060008 I went to my local Best Buy to upgrade the sound system in my Saab 9-3 Linear. I'd just purchased the car second hand and evidently the previous (first) owner went for the base sound package - which did not include the 6"x9"'s in the back - when purchasing the car. I've owned a few Saabs in my lifetime and had always been impressed with the speakers but within this particular car just weren't meeting my standards.
So, I consulted with a Best Buy salesmen in the electronics section in Secaucus, NJ who demoed the speakers for me and I thought, "For the price they sound pretty good," so I had the Geek Squad install them. Well, let me tell you how shocked I was once I got into the car and began playing music...outstanding! If you're looking for 6"x9" speakers you can't beat the prices on these and the quality.
For the record: When I purchased this second hand car months ago it only came with the stock door speakers and the stock 4"x4"s in the back. I upgraded the doors to Infinity after the first week of owning the car and it was a welcome addition. It was only after adding the 6"x9"s in the back that I was able to take full advantage of the sound. The bottom line is you can't go wrong with the Infinitys!

..

6006840060008 overall pretty decent speakers-slight alteration to the speaker mounts in my Saab 9-3 to get them to fit propery (just a bit too wide).

..

6006840060008 Got them on sale, great sound, very nice appearance, I had trouble for my app. but nothing to do with the speakers.

..

6006840060008 I already had a basic Alpine deck (4 x 16 watts) and Infinity 6.5 Reference for front speakers, so the big decision was which 6 x 9s for the rear speakers. It really couldn't have worked out any better to stay with Infinity Reference. I'm 60, still have "golden ears," and I don't think I've had a better system -- I've paid lots more, but this setup gets me true studio quality. You can't go wrong for any type of music except hip hop, and even then you may want these to go with your subs. These exceed my expectations, especially with the Best Buy price match. Can't go wrong with these.

..

6006840060008 Sounds great paired with 6.5 reference x in front dOors

Monitor indoor or outdoor locations with this INSTEON 75791 wireless IP security camera that captures images with 640 x 480 resolution and features 60 IR LEDs for clear visuals at up to 98'. The built-in wireless networking offers remote access.


..

6006840060008 I bought this so it over look my van. When I point the camera at it, All I can see was the hood of my van. lol well that won't work for me because I wanted it to see my whole back parking lot. No matter how I try, you can't adjust the view or anything.
The motion detector wasn't too bad. The recording was abit annoying. I had to call tech support for help. You have to turn off a lot of features on your IE or Firefox to get this thing working. When it recorfds, the folder always pop up. So if your typing or doing anything, it'll pop up and you'll have to closed it. You can't even min it cuz it'll pop up again.
Anyway, I won't recommend this to anyone, I return this and got the Logitech 750E its like Day and night!! cost more but well worth the money!

..

6006840060008 Easy to setup and has a decent picture in daylight. Decent night vision range also.
Power suppy cord died after 3 months. Called Best Buy for a replacement and they can't get one. Did not want to climb up and.have to unmount camera from top of business to send back to Best Buy. Found a replacement power cord on Amazon for $14.

..

6006840060008 Camera has a very narrow and far away focus point, great if you want to watch a road 100 feet from your house, worthless in your driveway though. Software is terrible and the setup is still ongoing 2 days later. It created multiple IP addresses and keeps getting confused on which one to use. This also created problems when it would TRY to record, most of the time it would fault out and not record anything. Save yourself the trouble and buy some other camera; not worth the time and frustration this thing has caused!!!

This iON America Air Pro Wi-Fi 1011 camcorder features a waterproof design that lets you capture still images and videos while underwater up to 30' deep. The USB interface makes it easy to transfer files to and from a computer.


..

6006840060008 This is a nice camera with an excellent picture. However it may take awhile compared to other cameras to set up. The instructions are not clear. There are no apps available yet for wi fi use and smart phones. ( after an hour of looking for it I found out they are waiting for approval ) The wi fi podz did not lock properly the first time and I was weary of getting it wet since ther is no warranty for water damage I took it back. If you have patience this is a nice camera with alot of accessories included.
Pros: looks, nice picture, comes with accessories, easy on/ off
Cons : no apps availble yet. not many additional accessories available like replacement lense or mounting options.

IRIScan Book 2 is a portable scanner that allows you to scan books and magazines anytime, anywhere and without ripping pages off. Simply roll your way across the document, and your scan will be saved automatically on the included MicroSD card and ready to be shared. The device completes the I.R.I.S. mobile scanner family, and comes with the cutting-edge OCR software Readiris Pro 12 compatible with both PC and Mac.


..

6006840060008 I actually brought my travel laptop with me to the store, along with an 8GB micro SD card that I bought on Amazon for something like $6, fully prepared to test the scanner in the store before leaving because I wanted to ensure it worked.
I bought a refurbished one that looked good as new for $50. I was very impressed with how it worked. Other reviews say the scanner is "tricky" and "takes some getting used to". I have no idea what they are talking about . This unit is very easy and straightforward to use. This scanner is lightweight and smaller than I expected, another plus.
The scans aren't super crisp, but neither are many photocopiers I might use to photocopy a textbook or cookbook or magazine article. It does the job and for the refurbished price, a no brainer.

..

6006840060008 
This pen allows you to scan words, sentences or paragraphs into your computer from newspapers, magazines, faxes, letters and more. 2 customizable buttons allow you to assign keyboard commands, such as enter or space, for added convenience.


..

6006840060008 The user manual is inadequate to guide the non-geek new user. Basic information is missing, like the manual (buried at the end of the Demo program). Also, helpful things like how to successfully install the software; what to uninstall if the first install fails; and how to get to important screens. Customer support relies on email exchanges, rather than more practical chat exchanges. Answers arrived 1-2 days later. Moreover, the tech support agent did not carefully read the exchanges, so they offered inappropriate and/or incomplete responses. Certain name and jargon used in the manual and by tech support were conflicting. I wasted many hours trying to make it work. For what it is worth, a techie friend eventually did make it work, but I can't afford to keep him on-call at my house. If a device or program is easily learned, logical and helpful for me to use, I'll keep it. But if not, as in this case, I won't keep it.

..

6006840060008 I have only been using this for a couple of months. I am in school for nursing and I have to say. . . This product cuts my study time in half. I don't have to type anything. I can have my slides, book, and notes in front of me and scan all three in conjunction with one another to make one study sheet for tests. It scans almost as fast as I can type, without the whole typing part. Which is really nice. It also scan over yellow highlighter. Which is super convenient! I wish I had this for my other degrees.

..

6006840060008 This is a really useful tool. It is not perfect and has a slight learning curve. It does exactly what it says it does and it is really easy to install and use right away. I do have to go back and edit a little bit but it is still much faster than typing out a book verbatim for outlines and notes especially if the book is dry or technical.

..

6006840060008 I was hesitant at first to purchase this scanner because of the negative reviews I found here. I still went ahead and bought it anyhow. And then when I received it and got it working, it'd show nothing but garbled text. I thought, "oh, just like some rewiews said." I called BestBuy.com to return it but then telephone rep suggested perhaps it was defective. I hadn't thought of that. So I got a replacement. I wasn't expecting anything different for results but, boy, was I wrong. This thing works like a charm. I am so happy I didn't give up on it. Perhaps the delivery carrier was to blame for the defective one, but whatever. This hand-held scanner's worth the price.

..

6006840060008 - Does not scan text clearly
- Does not import text into PC or Mac legibly
Perhaps the other editions of this product function better?

..

6006840060008 I purchased this to take notes of important material for school reference. It does a pretty good job at reading the words, only an occasional glitch or two. The directions leave a bit to be desired, but overall it's a useful tool and I am satisfied with it.

..

6006840060008 
Easily translate words by scanning text using this pen that recognizes up to 128 languages and features 11 language pairs. The voice synthesis feature allows you to hear text you've scanned.


..

6006840060008 This scanner works, but it's technology glitches sometimes and it's best to restore it to factory settings when that happens. The scanning is also a little slow to ensure accuracy and bright lighting is definitely needed to go faster. As a college student, my typing speed is pretty fast and I feel that sometimes I can type faster than the pen can scan, but if you are a slower typer, this pen could be very beneficial to you.

Scooba 390 Floor Washing Robot: Make your floors shine at the push of a button with the Scooba floor washing robot. The four-stage cleaning process vacuums, washes, scrubs and squeegees your floors for a thorough clean. Just fill the tank with cleaning solution and let your robot do the dirty work.


..

6006840060008 This is the second Scooba that I have owned and both do what they are suppose to. Fill it up, start it up when you leave the house and come back to a squeaky clean floor. Only complaint is the price.

..

6006840060008 IRobot really needs to improve the scooba and Roomba cleaning pattern, with the same technology as the braava/mint and neato vacuums. Im sorry but I am not digging this scooba for the price at all, first feel when i took it out of the box was the quality isn't there in the craftsmanship like the roombas, cheep plastic. The performance isn't there for the price due to the fact it misses a bunch of spots, and on my tile floor, the tracks from the tires were awful. When I emptied the dirty water bin it was dirty, but there sure wasn't a lot of dirty water in there, as if it left a lot on the floor, the bin was not even half full of dirty water, for the price the bin should be at least half full of dirty water, it shouldn't miss spots in open areas, and should not leave tire streaks, its a no go for me, bought the mint instead and love it.

..

6006840060008 If you have tile, it will leave a small water trail on the surrounding ridges of the tile. Semi-Noisy
I would imagine if you have hard-wood flooring or laminate it would work great.

..

6006840060008 I was disappointed with Scooba because it does not get the water off of the floor. They will need to improve this feature. I already own the Roomba and love it so thought the Scooba would be as high in quality but it is not.

..

6006840060008 I don't normally leave bad reviews, but since I paid so much for this Scooba cleaning system, I expected it to work. I used it twice, and it worked ok (still got hung up at spots). I used it again today and it is leaving puddles of water everywhere, and NOT picking up any of the water. Contacted I robot and they gave me a list of things to do to try to stop this issue. I could understand if I've used the thing for a year, but I have only used it twice. I'm going to try to return it.

..

6006840060008 The Scooba does a great job cleaning the floor. I was shocked to see how large this model is, but I was extremely pleased with how it performed. This particular model had upgrades to improve battery life and maintenance, which I believe has made it perform much better than the last model based on reviews I had read. It is rather loud , but I usually just turn it on and leave the room. Overall, I'd recommend the product if you don't feel like scrubbing your floors yourself.

The DreamTime Pro clock radio for iPhone and iPod gives you the option to wake to your iPhone, iPod, digital FM radio or the alarm. Every 5 seconds the volume will gradually increase until maximum volume has been reached.

Take your tunes on the go with this Jabra Solemate portable speaker that features Bluetooth technology, so you can stream music from a Bluetooth-enabled source up to 33' away. A built-in battery provides up to 8 hours of playback between charges.


..

6006840060008 Great sound quality especially for the size... take this everywhere with me since it's so easy to travel with. Worth the money.

..

6006840060008 Good sound for the size, but I think most of the newer products are these days. I also have a JBL Flip so have compared them side by side. The SM seems to have a little better bass tones but the Flip can play considerably louder (good tone, no distortion). When I'm at my desk I do prefer the SM because the slightly better sound quality at lower levels, but if I'm in a larger room or it I take it out in the garage to work on a project then I prefer the Flip because it simply plays louder (with good quality sound). Price aside, I think both products each have their strengths but are about equal overall. Given that the SM is 50% more, I can't justify recommending it over the Flip.

..

6006840060008 I was given a Jabra Solemate to review and wanted to share my experience as it really is an excellent portable speaker. The sound is great, I love how far away it can detect the source (answers calls as well as plays music) and it has some other great features. The AV cable is built into the bottom of the speaker so if you want to plug directly into your laptop the cable won't go missing. The "voice" in the speaker is fun, telling the user it is connected and when it powers on and off. Jabra Solemate comes with a bag so you can hear the sound perfectly but take to the beach without worrying about sand.
Great product!

..

6006840060008 I'm impressed by the BIG sound from this little speaker. The sound is clear and rich and continues to be so even at LOUD volumes. The rugged durability is a big plus, as is the splash resistance. Ours was even dropped in the shower (not by me!) and continued to to work perfectly!

..

6006840060008 I received a Jabra Solemate for review purposes. All opinions are 100% mine.
The Jabra Solemate Portable Speaker has made our summer even better. We've used it at the pool to listen to music on my iPhone. It only takes 30 seconds to connect via Bluetooth and the sound quality is amazing. The volume controls are great - we have no problem hearing the music from 10 feet or more away.
I like to use it in my home when cleaning as well. I like that it's wireless so I can carry the phone in my pocket while keeping the speaker in a central location. The durable bag eliminates worry that sand or water can get into the speaker if you carry it to the pool or beach.

..

6006840060008 It is awesome how such a small box can produce such quality sounds! Listening to music where I wanted in the past has always been a challenge. Most of the time you have to find a plug in for whatever device you are using. I know you can play music on some phones and laptop but, really those speakers just do not do it for me! I have been looking for a good speaker with bass! Yes, I am one of those who like to hear and feel the bass while I am listening to music! This speaker has it!
The Jabra Solemate comes with the speaker, USB cable, sound bag, audio cable, AC charger, and a quick start guide. I found it very easy to turn on an use! Really I did not have to even look at the guide. All you do is turn the Solemate on then hold the button up for three seconds for the Bluetooth connection to start. Then, it will begin to talk to you telling you it is ready to connect. As, soon as you are connected it will let you know that also. Very cool and funny at the same time. It is a dark sexy sounding voice to me.
It is so easy to take this with you anywhere! All you need is a bluetooth device with you {and everyone always has a cell phone} and instant connection. You can use the bag to protect it against dust, sand and dirt as well as moisture. Great for taking it to the beach or outside on a high humidity day!
I would highly recommend this speaker! Love it!

..

6006840060008 My husband has been the most excited for the Jabra Solemate. He says it is the best thing ever to bring into our workout room to play music while we are exercising on the bike or lifting weights. It is shaped like the bottom of a shoe on the bottom and very versatile. It is scratch resistant and it comes with a great splash proof drawstring bag that I have already used while the kids played in the sprinkler.
My favorite thing about the Jabra Solemate is that it talks to you. I wonder why more electronics don't? You turn on the bluetooth and it tells you how to connect and then when you connect it to your smartphone, MP3 player, tablet, laptop, or anything that can play music it says it is connected. You can connects via Bluetooth or the cord stored neatly in the bottom. I also like how it makes this low bass noise when you turn it off or on. According to its specs, it has a strong, deep bass from an integrated subwoofer and rich, vibrant acoustics from dual tweeters, the Solemate sounds great at any level. It goes up to 120 dB SPL* (at 0.5). I connected it to my phone and my kids thought it was great how I could turn it up and down through my phone controls or through the controls on top of the Solemate.

..

6006840060008 This little speaker is easy to transport and fits in my hand, all while delivering great sound. The battery lasts and the range is great. It is easy to set up the Bluetooth and with minimal buttons, even my four year old can operate this speaker! Great for outdoor parties or just lounging around the house! Worth the price!

..

6006840060008 Great sound for something so small. It's super affordable too , and I like the different selection of colors.

..

6006840060008 My favorite thing about the Jabra Solemate is the fact that it is cordless. I have a toddler who loves to pull on cords, and a cat who loves to chew on cords. The Jabra Solemate is left alone by my two mischief-makers! The sound quality is also amazing. I use it to replace my laptop speakers when watching movies. I feel like I'm in a a movie theater! :-)

Create delicious juices, smoothies and more with this juicer that features a 3600 rpm motor for powerful performance and an extra-large round feeder that accommodates most fruits and vegetables.


..

6006840060008 I ended up returning this item, do to the fact that I don't have time to bake or cook with the discarded pulp as suggested.
I liked the idea , but thought better to try a type of blender /juicer that will chop up and juice the entire fruit or veggie.

..

6006840060008 This juicer works great and is well worth the money. Tried lots of different combinations of fruits and vegetables. A piece of advise, go easy on the ginger root. Just a little bit gives you lots of flavor. Awesome product.

..

6006840060008 I bought this juicer because of all the great reviews. After 2 weeks of use, the motor stopped running. It would also overheat just from kale and the pulp was always very wet. Since it is covered under "warranty", I sent the juicer back with a money order for shipping. It has been over a month and have not received anything back and apparently my order has been cancelled (for reasons unknown to any supervisors) and they are sending me my broken juicer back. This is the worst company I have ever dealt with and I don't recommend buying any type of Jack Lalanne juicer. I bought a "Bella" juicer since then and it works great. I will never buy anything from Jack Lalanne again!

..

6006840060008 It is a great product, however the container could be larger to hold more of the juice

..

6006840060008 THIS JUICER IS SO EFFECTIVE I USE ONLY HALF OF THE PRODUCE I AM USED TO USING. IT GETS EVERY DROP OUT AND MORE! I REALLY RECCOMEND THIS, ESPECIALLY FOR THE PRICE. I GOT IT ON SALE, BUT EVEN NOT ON SALE THE PRICE IS GREAT.

..

6006840060008 excellent product for those who want to start a change from poor eating habit. Also it is a great motivational tool that will have us thinking a little more about our health, and allow simple access for making a good worthwhile snack supplement. Use it in good health.

..

6006840060008 Good product at a great price..thanks to Best Buy. I researched tons of juicers..and after reading tons of reviews..and checking several out first hand..I ended up with this quality unit.
My wife suggested I check Kohls and Walmart. Both had it available at a decent price, but I am a loyal BB customer..and I thought, why not check there? Anyway..to make a long story short. I am a happy customer. Mostly because..in the end..Best Buy had the better price. Even with $25 Kohls cash I still came out ahead by nearly $20 more dollars!

..

6006840060008 This juicer is really quiet and really easy to use. It is also very easy to take apart and clean. We've used it almost every day since we opened it for Christmas! My husband loves the opportunity to drink fresh and healthy juices! Our whole family gets involved in the juicing process, and my daughter loves to put the fruits in the machine!

..

6006840060008 After comparing other juicers we decided to go with the Jack Lalanne. This is the first time we have juiced and it has been a good experience so far. The juicer was easy to setup and to keep from having a big mess we put a bag in the container that holds the pulp and then add it to our compost. You get of juice and less pulp. I would recommend this juicer to anyone especially if your new to juicing. The book gives alot of great tips and recipes to try.

..

6006840060008 Great juicer for those who are hopping on to the juicing bandwagon. This juicer is powerful and works great.

Carry on conversations with incoming callers from up to 33' away from your Bluetooth-enabled mobile phone using this Jawbone Jambox 40209BBR Bluetooth speaker that features noise/echo reduction and DSP technology for crystal-clear audio.


..

6006840060008 I love the portability of the jambox and the sound quality is great. I just wish it was louder. The sound doesnt quite carry through at parties

..

6006840060008 
Control your mobile phone wirelessly using this Jawbone Jambox 39115BBR Bluetooth speakerphone, which features a call answer/end button for simplified use. DSP technology and noise echo reduction ensure clear audio transmission.


..

6006840060008 The bass is awful and sound quality is rather poor. The BIG JAMBOX sounds much better. This one does't live up to its price tag.

..

6006840060008 I had heard mixed reviews about the Jambox so I finally decided to give it a try. This is probably the worst sound I have ever experienced from a smaller bluetooth speaker. It sounded like a tin can. The buttons would stick together & the unit itself felt cheaply made. I don't know if I was unfortunate in the model I had, but it was simply awful. I would go with the $99 JBL Flips and actually get good sound for a much cheaper price. Take my advice and go listen to it yourself before buying. Everyone's ears are different.

..

6006840060008 My device starting to fail. After searching the internet it turns out this is a common problem with the jambox, where the soldering on the usb connection makes it believe it is connected fails the bluetooth connection. After talking to tech support with Jambox, they acknowledge the same problem but their replacement policy is bad. Be prepared to be hassled and ship your product first and then wait for a replacement. Others have complained that their replacements show up faulty as well. If you want this product, go online and check out youtube to how to properly solder the connection back or prepare to have a faulty unit.

..

6006840060008 The power port inside the box broke after 45 days. The box is now unuseable.

..

6006840060008 I really want to love this product. And I did, until about a month ago. At that time the connector for the USB charger became loose. After some research, I discovered a massive amount of similar complaints/issues. To be clear, my unit was never dropped or handled roughly. The Jambox has a know design flaw with this connection. My unit was 11 months old so it was still under warranty. I had to ship the unit (at my cost) to get a refurbished Jambox (not even my purchased color). I am still waiting for the replacement. Buyer beware.

..

6006840060008 Got it for streaming mp3s and no hands calling in car. Barely could hear it over road noise. Requires constant re-mating if phone is disconnected.

..

6006840060008 I bought it one year ago, and it has been working fine. Sound is great, bluetooth setup easy. Very easy to carry it around on trips, so I do not have to connect my iPhone to other people's speakers.
I am not sure what the "software updates" are about as this is just a speaker. (New voices and such?) I did not try it because the update asks me to enter my computer password. This is akin to giving your contractor the keys and leaving home. Unless the software update is to your computer operating system, you should not have to enter a computer password.

..

6006840060008 I bought one of these the other day for work. I'm not allowed to wear earbuds but I can have a small radio. So I bought this to plug my Creative Zen MP3 players into at work. I listened to it at Best Buy and was surprised at the sound quality with a demo IPod. I took it home and charged it and took it to work the next day. I plugged in my MP3 player and started listening to music. It sounded like junk. The sound was all distorted and the louder it went the worse it got. I turned it to an acceptable level so I could atleast listen to music while I worked. The speaker lasted about 5 hours on a charge and it was dead. I took it home and charged it again and the next day at work same deal 5 hours and the speaker was dead. I work 10 hour days, kinda hard to make it with no music for 5 hours. I did try a coworkers IPod with the speaker and it did sound better. It must have to do with the quality of ITunes Music versus Creative Labs ability to rip music at 320kbs for better quality. Either way, the Jambox was returned. As I was leaving Best Buy I noticed a grey and green box with a speaker called Goal Zero Rock Out Speaker. I looked at it and saw it was like the jambox but for $25 not $150 and the box said it lasts for 40 hours of playing on one charge. I took it home and plugged in my MP3 player and was really impressed with how much better it sounded than the jambox and you can plug in multiple speakers with no effect to your MP3 output.

..

6006840060008 I thought that the Jawbone JAMBOX where very unique in design. And have a nice sound for only having two speakers in them, the bass is great if thats what you are looking for (more than base then the beats The Pill). It also has a unique battery regulator that appears on your phone to let you know how much battery is left in it without having to guess plus it lets you know on its own. Overall its a good device for it size but, could use a little more power in its sound.

..

6006840060008 Everything about this speaker is great for my needs. I use it when I travel and in my office. It's a very small speaker so for it's size it totally delivers. I purchased one for my parents as well and they are very happy with it's performance. Jambox may not be for everyone but it met my needs perfectly.

..

Take calls from your mobile phone wirelessly with this Jawbone Jambox 39116BBR Bluetooth speakerphone that features DSP technology and noise echo reduction for clear audio transmission. A call answer/end button allows simple control over your phone.


..

6006840060008 This speaker has really nice sound but I cannot get it to go loud enough to hear it from room to room. Also, syncing to IPhone and Surface Pro was a snap but still having a problem with my son's android phone

..

6006840060008 I picked this up on clearance at a local BB store. I needed a mobile speakerphone for webinar purposes, and got this after returning a "Monster" branded model which I returned (to a different retailer) due to poor sound quality of my voice being heard. The Jambox has performed flawlessly. Crystal clear both ways. My "good" review on range has nothing to do with Bluetooth - I rated it on how far you canbe from the speaker without having to raise your voice to be heard (about 8 feet). I use this with jawbone's The Nerd Bluetooth adaptor and a 2 year old Lenovo laptop. I would have rather had the new mini version of the Jambox for its compactness when traveling, but the $100 price savings on the original was too good to pass up.

..

6006840060008 Bought this little guy for my mom, and she absolutely will not share it with anyone. she uses it for everything, phone calls, music in her car, pandora, and uses it for her ipad so that she can have better sound for when she is reading her e-books. if you are going to use this speaker for a party or having people over, i would highly recommend getting the Jawbone Big Jambox because that is going to have the crazy huge sound that you will want with that, and for more personal use, get the jambox. She loves how she can take this EVERYWHERE with her.

..

6006840060008 This little thing has rocked my world. To be honest, I had been eyeing it for quite some time at my other favorite store, who shall remain nameless (Best Buy didn't have a demo to play around with).
At that store, I played around with the demo numerous times, however remained suspicious as the sound was VERY good: Full, Rich, Crisp and Clear. I thought, for sure, this was not accurate and that it was surely rigged; particularly because it was so small...
We all learned in science class, back-in-the-day, that bigger sound required bigger hardware. Period. Not anymore!
The Jambox is my first foray into the land of Bluetooth speakers (yes, I'm slow to adopt new things, because I'm so particular aka "picky') and it certainly did not disappoint. In fact, after I opened the box, it EXCEEDED my expectations.
Firstly, it's heavier than it looks (that was strangely reassuring to me), secondly, it only has 4 buttons, thus it is impossible to be confused about it. Out-of-the-box, the sound is brilliant, but when you enable this miracle called "LiveAudio", well, you have a whole additional level of richer and fuller sound at your disposal. All the tones, nuances from deep bass to higher treble are clearly audible.
Also, you can easily enable or disable this feature. Of course, it comes with a charger, audio cable and a suede-like sleeve to protect your new friend.
Furthermore, when you connect your new little friend to your computer, it will update itself, you can change options, and you can enjoy optional add-ons to make the sound experience personalized. Truly. Epic.
Fear not the price, as I did, because you're getting your money's worth for sure.
EPIC sound in a fashionable little box. 'nuff said.
Enjoy.

..

6006840060008 For my use this is a great speaker and love that it comes in a variety of colors. Love listening to my tunes in the kitchen while cooking. I can put it in my office and set the music I want to listen to vs using the radio.

..

6006840060008 I am still looking for the right portable speaker that will satisfy my specific needs.
It is a tiny speaker, and for its size it has the better sound overall compared to the Jabra SOLEMATE and The Pill by Beats but it has the disadvantage that it is not loud enough, on the field it gets behind the 2 other speakers.
I like to take it all over with me and where it fails the most is in the shower, I cannot hear it when I am taking a shower. It is simply not loud enough.
If it is sound quality what you are looking for, this tiny speakers sounds great at any volume level, but if you need more power, you need to keep looking as I am right now.

Monitor your fitness, sleep and nutrition habits with this Jawbone UP 39907BBR wristband that tracks distance, calories burned, active time and activity intensity, as well as sleep patterns and nutrition to help you achieve and maintain good health.


..

6006840060008 Overall, it's a great product! Does exactly what it says it will do. Great for tracking stats to help one get in shape. It's easy to use & does all the transferring instantly upon connecting to your phone/tablet. The biggest complaint that I have is that it's taking a little getting used to sleeping with it on to measure sleep habits. I'm sure I'll eventually get used to it being on at night & won't even notice that it's there.

..

6006840060008 It's interesting and even motivating to see how many steps you take in a day. Having a goal inspires you a little bit. And it's interesting to see how much and how quality your sleep was.
But the things don't last long. I and 4 friends got one. One person's wouldn't connect right out of the box. She had to replace it immediately. Another friend's lasted about a month before it stopped working. Mine wouldn't hold a charge after 2 weeks (my free replacement is in the mail).
Luckily Jawbone is really nice about replacing your stuff. And maybe the new generation will be a little more reliable. But this version of the Up doesn't hold up well.

..

6006840060008 Do not waste your time and money on this product, like I did. I purchased a blue UP and it stopped working after 3 months. I am still waiting over 3 months to get a replacement from Jawbone. After reading other posts on this product leads me to believe that there are major defects with this version (similar to the previous version). If you are considering purchasing an UP24 (the new version), I would wait 6 months and read the reviews. Now, I have a $130 useless wristband. Inferior product + poor customer service = unhappy customer.

..

6006840060008 Excellent product. Ease of use. Great prcess to assit me in achieving good health.

..

6006840060008 Got one because my wife has one so we can track each others use.

6006840060008 my brother likes it. .Whenever he does exercise he wears it, kinda enjoy this product.

Monitor your fitness goals and sleep patterns with this Jawbone UP 39910BBR wristband that tracks distance, calories burned and activity intensity levels, along with hours slept and deepness of sleep levels, to help you achieve a healthy lifestyle.


..

6006840060008 My purpose for buying this device was to track the amount of sleep I get each night. It takes a long time for me to fall asleep most nights and I feel like I wake up often so I wanted something that could tell me how much sleep I'm really getting each night. This device does exactly that it tells me how long it took to fall asleep, how many times I woke up and it measures my light and deep sleep. The accuracy is a little questionable sometimes, but if your like me and just need to have a general idea this device is great for that plus I also get to see my activity and I can track my eating which helps with my digestion issues.

..

6006840060008 The jawbone UP band is a great motivational tool to keep you active. It keeps a pretty accurate account of your movement for the day and shows you when you need to get off your butt & get more active. The thing that surprised me was how accurate the sleep tracking was. The one downside is when you are exercising in a set position it doesn't track that. Any mat based exercises doesn't register. I have been very happy with mine

..

6006840060008 I love my up band because it motivates me to move, eat right and workout. I would recommend it to anyone that A. Enjoys keeping up with their body an how it functions. What I like about it most is that you wear it with pretty much anything and the colors are a great for everyone.

..

6006840060008 I absolutely love my UP band! It tracks your sleep patterns (deep & light sleep) and how long it takes to fall asleep. It tracks your daily steps and activity level. It also logs foods but I use My Fitness Pal and that app syncs to the UP app so it is really nice. Run Keeper also syncs with it. Great way to really get to know yourself and your daily habits. You can network with friends on the app. Make sure to use the size chart, I had to return my small for a medium, the small is really small. Works great so far, no complaints. If you are not used to wearing a watch, it may take a while to get used to something on your wrist but I adapted quickly.

..

6006840060008 I like it because it's easy to take off and put on, easy to use. Very simple. Gives pretty accurate feed back. I like that there are other apps that can be used with the UP to help you track meals, calories in, other types of workouts, etc...

..

6006840060008 I love my jawbone up. That is until it stopped working 15 days after purchase. Jawbones customer service is great and I had a new one with in a week. I'm concerned that it might be a continued fail though based off of forums. It's a fun technology that gets you moving when it works. But when your band dies its a bit of a bummer...

..

6006840060008 So much fun to be woke up at different times throughout the week.
Great step counter.
Has a wonderful calorie counter with all foods.
So much fun. Wonderful. Love color.

This Jay Turser 200 Series 6-string full-size single-cutaway electric guitar features 2 humbucking pickups for high-quality sound. The volume and tone controls permit simple audio customization.


..

6006840060008 The flame maple and carved top, with all the chrome trim, makes for a fabulous looking guitar. It stays in tune even after a good flailing, thanks to nice tuners and bridge setup. The tone is weak in clarity, but good for high gain sounds. Order up some hot pickups and you'll have the sweet sounds of a two thousand dollar guitar and the looks to match.
Mine looks nicer than my other eleven guitars.

6006840060008 Easy to use and great sound

..

6006840060008 I bought this speaker a few weeks ago and I have been using it every single day. the sound is great for such a small speaker, charges real quick, easy to pair with laptops, phones, I took it to the park people came to me saying where was the music coming from I had it on the floor cause we where cooking out family members where like wow where did I get the small but great sound speaker at best buy so yea it was load not bad at all speaker specially the price I also have the flip from jbl great speakers

Big sound, long battery life and a powerful charging station for devices. The JBL Charge delivers unsurpassed portable audio performance from your mobile devices and tablets. It provides more than 12 hours of playback time from its built-in, high-capacity, 6000mAh Li-ion rechargeable battery, and it can even charge your other mobile devices on the go via its built-in USB port. With two 1-5/8-inch (41-millimeter) full-range drivers and a built-in bass port, it produces full-range JBL sound with exceptional bass. It also wirelessly streams audio from any Bluetooth-equipped smartphone or tablet. The JBL Charge wireless speaker is a portable audio powerhouse for any environment.


..

6006840060008 I compared this with other devices, it came down to that JBL or. Bose Soundlink 2. This wins hands down, great sound for less money. The unit is well built and holds a charge for hours

..

6006840060008 I love bluetooth technology because it keeps getting better and better, and this thing is another example. First of all...you simply can't go wrong with JBL sound. JBL sound was top of the line and kicking' butt back in the 70's and 80's, and they are still going strong. I got this as a gift for my wife and now I'm using it. Such a great price for the quality of sound. It charges pretty quickly and it also has a USB port that enables you to charge your mp3 player while you listen to music. The charge feature is slow but when your mp3 player is dead, like mine is every time I go to use it, it will give it enough juice to keep the music going. For the guys, it's built like a tank, for the women it's simple to use and set up. I highly recommend this unit!!

..

6006840060008 I use this speaker on a daily basis and definitely recommend purchase.

..

6006840060008 This wireless speaker has far better sound than any other wireless out there including Bose. This JBL rocks!

..

6006840060008 For the size it is a great speaker, we take it practice and the whole field is jam'n!

..

6006840060008 Bought mostly for camping and sitting at the beach. Battery lasts a long enough that I don't remember when I last recharged it, so I charge it. And it still works! Syncs really easily to my iPhone 4s. I recommend it if you need sound on a small patio, tailgater, or a radioless boat.

..

6006840060008 I usually do a lot of research before I make a purchase. I definitely wanted something with a speakerphone that would allow me to listen to music, answer calls and have a little more freedom of movement while I did whatever I needed to do. The setup is very easy and the sound is great.

..

6006840060008 My overall experience with it has been great. I did choose this item over the over expensive beats audio it sounds better than that brand. For the price of it I think it is great. Other speaker devices are overpriced for the quality of sound they produce. This product is reasonable with the price. I also like how it is small and looks nice. A plus is that it can charge your phone if you are not near a wall port. Either way I have enjoyed it :)

..

6006840060008 Very happy with my purchase. After listening to many with in the store, this had the best sound for the price.

..

6006840060008 the sales person allowed me to test several while in the store some had better sound quality and others were not as good but for the price i feel the charge gave the best bang for the buck.

..

6006840060008 Needed new speakers to attach for laptop for watching movies, etc. I don't hear well, so I need external speakers. Works great.

..

6006840060008 Problems from the start. Sound was breaking up due to internal loose wire or bad connection.

..

6006840060008 the speakers sound good, and the balance adjusts well. but there is no way to adjust bass nor treble.

..

6006840060008 The sound is great ... when it actually plays. It has an auto-off feature that kicks in only after a few minutes but requires a manual adjustment every time. After only a month this has now turned into a short in the speakers and only plays for a few seconds at a time. Extremely disappointed since the price is higher than direct competitors. Stick with Logitech or something cheaper than this.

With a satin-copper-colored base, this striking and powerful blender is the best choice when it comes to drinks, soups, sauces and dips. The 500 Watt motor spins razor sharp blades that handle virtually any food, even ice. The electronic speed control and a pulse option allow you to have total control over the consistency of your final product. Simply fill the 50oz glass jar with your favorite ingredients and blend it with a simple push of just one button. Features are backlit control buttons for great visibility and a detachable stainless steel blade for easy cleaning.


..

6006840060008 Blender operated great for me until about a year of using it probably a dozen times. The glass jar had a defect causing it to fracture around the base during operation and as a result destroy the motor from the liquid leak. The company would not replace it.
For the cost of the product I would have thought the customer service and warranty would be solid. I found out they were both a joke. The warranty only covers the motor for 1 year and nothing else. Even if there is a defect and the other parts of the product break you have to fork over the money to replace it no exceptions and the costs for replacement are a joke, even if it falls within the 1 year period. I would expect this type of warranty and service out of a cheaper product.
Don't make the same mistake that i did buying this product. It is a waste of money. The blender works but if it breaks be prepared for a company that doesn't stand behind their products.

..

6006840060008 Best deal for a cheap usb 3.0 Hub. Nothing special but nothing wrong with it either.

..

6006840060008 Easy access to the USB ports, I can leave it plugged in all the time

..

6006840060008 Manufacturer doesn't provide any compatibility information. Purchased to use with Apple SuperDrive for MacBook Pro with retina as power specifications made device appear to be compatible. However, it would not support the SuperDrive. As powered from wall and not computer, external hard drives may stay on all the time, even when computer is shut down. Would only recommend if using with flash drives or mobile devices.

Protect your camera with this backpack that is designed for use with most DSLR cameras with a standard attached lens. The double-compartment design offers convenient storage space, while the ripstop nylon exterior provides durability.


..

6006840060008 I absolutely love this backpack. Well, I guess I should say my wife does. She is a photographer and she uses this every time we do a session. We bought the backpack originally as a bag to carry around on an overseas trip we did. It was perfect for everything we needed. It was also her carry on for the plane. Everything we needed fit just right inside the bag. Great value, great performance, durable. Kata is a wonderful brand!

..

6006840060008 I just recieved it today, FINALLY, it was supposed to be here awhile ago. First off, although it holds alot, its ridiculously slow, i could have bought several $5 flash drives that hold 4gigs, and been much happier. Right now i am currently just trying to copy 89 pictures and a couple 3minute movies to it manually, its taken over a half hour, and im still waiting. and before you say it, i JUST got it, so i know it has enough memory. I dont reccomend this product, unless you have nothing else to do but sit here and wait.

..

6006840060008 I have Windows 7 64bit on my HP Pavilion laptop. It works fine with the 64bit. I use it primarily for music and just plug it into my car. It's much easier than plugging my ipod in. Good product. It's a 32gb usb, but it only allows for 29gb to be used. Now biggie, who really listens to that much music.

6006840060008 This has so far been one of the best coffee makers I have owned. 14 cups, programmable brew strength, and all the other features, make mornings bearable

..

6006840060008 i all way buy kitchenaid its very dependable and very good product

..

6006840060008 This coffee maker has been a real pleasure to use. Does a great job of making full 14 cup pots but also has setting to make smaller pots and does a great job doing that also. I would recommend it to everybody. It is not cheap but it is not cheaply made either and matches the rest of our Kitchen Aid appliances.

Blend your favorite hot or cold ingredients with this KitchenAid Diamond KSB1575CU 5-speed blender that features Intelli-Speed motor control that offers automatic blade adjustment for efficient blending, even as the density of the ingredient changes.


..

6006840060008 Love,love, love this blender. After researching ALL the different blenders I finally decided on the Kitchen Aid and I have not regretted it. Purchased a blender to mainly make smoothies and this blender does a great job handling veggies and even frozen fruit. Chops giant clumps of ice in seconds. Drinks are awesome! Was a bonus that I could order the color I wanted and got it on sale. I also took advantage of an extra bonus summer percentage off the price. From start to finish my shopping experience was a pleasure. When I picked up my blender it was carried to my car by a polite sales associate. Really nice since I have to walk with a cane. I will definitely shop Best Buy again!

..

6006840060008 I had smaller KitchenAid countertop appliances. I gave those to my son and upgraded to the larger ones. Love the blender, but be careful when you wash it because the blade and pitcher are all one piece.

..

6006840060008 Works great, arrived on time and powers through everything. Will turn ice cubes into snow. This will be the last blender you buy.

..

6006840060008 I use this to make smoothies out of frozen fruit and it works great. The motor on this is very powerful and I have had no problems at all with this blender. Highly recommended.

KitchenAid 4 Slice, Manual High-Lift Lever Toaster with LCD display with digital progress bar, extra-wide 1.5 inch slots which will accept the thickest bagels, breads or pastries, adjustable shading control which regulates browning of the toast, and a TOAST/CANCEL button.


..

6006840060008 This replaced an aging toaster and with the new features it has it works really good.

..

6006840060008 Needed a new 4-slice. Saw this one on a daily deal at really good price. Received in timely fashion with no package damage. Does a really great job on a variety of things one would toast.

..

6006840060008 Great overall toaster. Looks nice next to my stainless steel appliances. Love using the "bagel" feature to toast the tops of my bagel while warming the bottoms. Cooks levels 1-8. So far I haven't gone above level 3 or it will burn. Great buy!

..

6006840060008 I always like kitchenaid products. This is a great toaster

..

6006840060008 Nice wide spaces and a great toaster. Love the looks.

..

6006840060008 I would buy this toaster again for myself and as a gift.

..

6006840060008 Excellent toaster! Toasts your bread exactly how you like it

..

6006840060008 never have this quality. now I can toast my english muffins and heat cold French toast \s and waffles.

..

6006840060008 I picked this toaster up on a daily deal. It looks great and works great.

..

6006840060008 My grand kids make many of their own meals using this toaster. No more fighting for a slot and they can make whatever they want and it fits! Great purchase after living with an old 2 slice.

This stylish hand mixer features a 7-speed electronic digital control that includes two slow stir speeds and one high whip speed. Soft start electronic control adjusts to the resistance of what you're mixing for smooth, consistent operation.


..

6006840060008 This mixer feels flimsy and shakes during use in a way that my old, cheaper, but no longer made, mixer never did. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be anything better without taking a huge jump in price. So this one seems the best of a bad lot.

..

6006840060008 Got this for my wife to replace a hand mixer that was 20+ years old. Looking forward to 20+ years with this one!

..

6006840060008 
Grinder attachment greatly expands a stand mixer's flexiblity
Ideal for grinding meats, grating cheese, making bread crumbs and combining dips, salsas, spreads
Grinder can be used with any KitchenAid stand mixer
Includes fine and coarse grinding plates, tips, and recipes
Most parts dishwasher safe for easy clean-up


..

6006840060008 I like all the options for the kitchen-aid stand mixer.

..

6006840060008 The wife loves it! We plan on using it a lot. It'll be great for doing tomatoes..

..

6006840060008 Came home made ground beef and the best taco ive had... Fresh beef with better flavor...

..

6006840060008 This is one of least inexpensive accessories for a kitchen aid mixer, so it is a good starter accessory. Since other accessories can run in the hundreds of dollars,Mathis is a low priced starter accessory as you get accustomed to your new mixer. Best buy actually had the lowest price out of all the websites I looked at,so I was delighted to get it there!

..

6006840060008 Easy to use, works great with mixer, I love it alot

..

6006840060008 The electric grinder saves time over using a hand grinder, however you have to take the time to cut the meat into chunks that the grinder can handle.

..

6006840060008 This attachments fits perfectly, does exactly what you would expect of it. I had a little difficulty figuring out how to take it all apart for cleaning, but worked it out without too much trouble. We started at a lower speed and gradually worked out way up as needed. There is a certain amount of learing curve, but we caught on fairly quickly.

..

6006840060008 This accessory grinder for foot stand KitchenAid mixers is a great addition to increase the versatility of your appliance. It is easy to mount and easy to clean once you have finished. The plastic screw core makes it look a bit less durable than what would be expected of this brand.

..

6006840060008 If using Kitchenaid stand mixer, this a a great companion for more options.

..

6006840060008 Wonderful grinder, very quick attachment. This is a very good addition to my kitchen. A lovely workhorse.

KitchenAid 2 Slice, One-touch motorized lift control Toaster with LCD display with digital progress bar, extra-wide 1.5 inch slots which will accept the thickest bagels, breads or pastries, adjustable shading control which regulates browning of the toast, and a TOAST/CANCEL button.


..

6006840060008 Toasts for bread and bagels. It will burn if you use the top two settings.

..

6006840060008 I purchased this toaster 2-1/2 years ago. It's only received light use by one person on weekends. I bought it because of all the features and it looked great, so imagine my surprise when I went to use it today and it popped the GFI outlet. Thinking perhaps the problem was with the outlet, I tried using it on another outlet that is on a different circuit. Again, the GFI popped. Now I have a hardly-used, great-looking toaster that doesn't work. Am totally disappointed in this product and will not recommend.

..

6006840060008 This toaster looks great and works well, with everything you could ever want from a toaster. Crumb tray, bagel/"keep warm"/defrost/reheat settings, 7 levels of heat, mechanized lift (because pushing a lever is so straining on the hands), bright blue LED display with auto dim when not in use, and beeping when the toast has finished.
The complaints in regards to the beeping being too loud, is somewhat warranted, but nothing I found to be too concerning.
As to what it actually is supposed to do -- toast, well it does that fairly well. Better than any $15 toaster I've ever used, but not by much.
More like 3.5 stars but only whole numbers allowed here, so decided to round down.

..

6006840060008 This toaster works as expressed in all the documentation. It easy to use and also looks good on the kitchen counter. I would definitely recommend this toaster.

..

6006840060008 I love this toaster. Love the motorized lift mechanism, the bells that sound when toast is done (never had that before) and everything is toasted to perfection. I retired and like toast most days. I had to play around with level for browning to find the perfect shade, but for me it varies with different breads. I have nothing negative to say about this toaster and I have had plenty of them over the years. I simply love it!!

..

6006840060008 The toaster works very well. Just noticed once that the toast was browner on the outside, the same for both slices. But most times it seems to toast evenly. Other than that this toaster does an excellent job.
There is a single beep when the toast is done. Not annoying but seems unnecessary because if you're close enough to hear the beep then you're close enough to hear the toast pop up! But at least the single beep isn't annoying like I've read some other brands are.

..

6006840060008 It was well worth the wait and sure beats buying a cheap toaster ever 2-3 years this will last and is perfect for the decor in my Kitchen I also like the facts it Beeps as your toast is done so you know

..

6006840060008 it's nearly brand new but being a KitchenAid I have every expectation that it will be reliable over the long haul. I like that it senses the frozen breads and toasts them fully and the bagel setting that only fully toasts the cut side. No mishaps or problems so far.

..

6006840060008 This toaster had such great reviews and my only real complaint is that both sides do not brown evenly. One side browns nicely and the other side browns very little.
For the money spent, it should work much better.

..

6006840060008 Seems to work fine with two pieces of bread, but with only one piece it burns one side and barley toasts the other. We tried single slices in both sides of the toaster and there was no difference, and no, we didn't have it on the bagel setting. I ended up taking it back to Best Buy. We're currently using our old Black and Decker again, we have to watch it so that it doesn't occasionally burn the toast, but at least it toasts evenly! Didn't have it long enought to rate the Durability.

..

Bring homemade variety to spaghetti night when you use the attachments to make your very own linguine, fettuccine and pasta.


..

6006840060008 I bought this for a Christmas gift for a family member and they love it! Works great with the KitchenAid mixer they got last Christmas! Now they want even more mixer attachments!

..

6006840060008 A lot easier to make larger amounts for holiday meals!

..

6006840060008 I bought this for my wife despite the reviews of people not liking the product, not easy to use or too difficult to clean. We have not experienced any of those complaints. The rollers are terribly easy to use, cleaning is a bit of a chore but it really isn't that bad. I spend about 10 minutes getting all three attachments as clean as new.
Great product, works wonderfully as advertised and my wife was very happy with it. It was expensive but worth it thus far.

..

6006840060008 It's heavy duty and keep on going? Easy to use, hooks right up to most any kitchen aid mixer

KitchenAid Personal Coffee Maker with Optimized Brewing Technology and a small and tall design, perfect for any space. Removable water tank to easily add fresh water. 18 oz thermal mug and gold tone filter included


..

6006840060008 It's just alright. I bought it to stop drinking plain coffee out so it does the job, but I'm not thrilled with this purchase. It works as promised but I wonder if the water isn't quite hot enough to brew the coffee at a more desireable temp.

..

6006840060008 This is my second KitchenAid purchase. I love my new coffee maker. It's stylish, easy to use and I don't have to buy coffee filters anymore.

..

6006840060008 Having come from a $29 coffee maker with a timer that took way to long to brew, I was a bit concerned that this coffee maker, without a timer, would leave me standing and waiting for coffee. This was not the case! A 16 oz cup of coffee takes about 2 minutes to brew and after learning how much coffee to use, makes a great cup of coffee.
It is easy to fill the water each night and add coffee to the filter. I do have to pull the coffee maker out from under the cabinet for two reasons during this process. You add coffee by swinging the tray from right to left. I have a cabinet to the left so it would not open if I did not pull the coffee maker out on the counter further. Also, when I brew in the morning, there is a vent on the top rear of the coffee maker. Steam comes out of that and would saturate the bottom of the kitchen cabinet, which over time I could see being a problem. Pulling the coffee maker out from under the cupboard for brewing resolves both of these issues.
Previous cheap coffee makers would last about a year in our house. I am hoping this one last much longer.

6006840060008 Size is great to get job done. Pineapple juice was so much easier in this machine. LOVE the color great addition to my pink kitchen collection. Wish they had more

..

6006840060008 This is my first KitchenAid product. After my daughter had lower jaw surgery I knew that I would need a very good blender to prepare her meals. This blender is so easy to operate and clean. I love it.

..

6006840060008 Bought the blender for my mom and she loves it. She's making smoothies, shakes, and anything and everything possible. She is crazy about the color since her kitchen is primarily white so the tangerine is a nice splash of color. It came right on time.

..

6006840060008 I looked at several blenders online and in-person. I finally settled on the KitchenAid KBS560 for its design, technical specs, price and reviews. I use the machine to make iced protein drinks. The "crush ice" function does what it says, which is great for ice only. I use the "Stir" speed to make smoothies. It does a good job of crushing the ice at this speed without shooting the drink into the lid of the pitcher. The smoothie comes out super cold with only very small pieces of ice - the way I like it. The plastic pitcher seems durable and its mechanical parts fit tightly into the pitcher. There is no slack between the blender base and the pitcher either, which tells me that machine is engineered for durability. This is a good buy.

..

6006840060008 I am very disappointed with this blender. I read a lot of reviews and it seemed to be a great blender for the price. It is not. It barely blends basic smoothies and I can't believe how loud it is. I was trying to avoid spending $500 on a blender but so far I can't find one that can do the job spending less.

..

6006840060008 I love that there is one piece, it makes for easy clean up. Also since I have another KitchenAid product they look very stylish on my counter. I love the red color.

..

6006840060008 This blender was not on sale and still 1/2 the price of buying it in Canada. Great deal and great Kitchenaide blender

..

6006840060008 This is a great blender for daily use at home for fruit smoothies, salsas, milk shakes and more. I use this blender just about everyday and have owned several other brands and this is really the best I've ever used.

..

6006840060008 This blender is a work-horse. Whips up smoothies, margaritas, milkshakes without breaking a sweat. The blender jug is wide and light and easy to clean. The blender itself is heavy and very very solid. A great blender, and a quarter the price of a Vitamix or a Blendtec

..

6006840060008 I like the size of the pitcher. My old Kitchenaid is still working very well but the pitcher is too small for meal replacement smoothies, however this one is perfect.

KitchenAid KMT4115OB Toaster - Toast, Bagel - Onyx Black


..

6006840060008 My husband bought this toaster for me it works great it is part red and stainless steel so if goes with my Kitchen perfectly

..

6006840060008 Returned within a week. Bought another toaster Calphalon, works great.

..

6006840060008 Great toaster for the price. Love the extra wide slots. Can do both bread and bagel at the same time. the individual controls let you get the desired toastiness.

And built-in image stabilization smooths out even the roughest ride. Whether you're carving up the mountain or pulling stunts in the skate park, the PLAYSPORT Video Camera / Zx5 is up for anything. And with a touch of the Share button, shocking your social network couldn't be simpler. Show the world why you're So Kodak. We dare you.Memory card sold separately.


..

6006840060008 I haven't had a camcorder for alot of years, but this one is very simple from the first time I picked it up. It has nice definition, and it's so simple.
I pop it in my purse and go, and it's great for getting videos of the family, because they are only smiling if they are short videos!
It's a nice price, too.

..

6006840060008 I chose this for shooting my swimming technique. I placed it in a variety of places from the pool deck to the bottom of the pool. It was solid in each area. The one drawback is the lack of a wide angle lens. But remember, it is a very inexpensive camera. Wide angle lenses are going to run on higher end cameras. The picture quality was magnificent and its ease of use is simple!

..

6006840060008 The Kodak ZX5 is a great out of the box camera. It was easy to understand right out of the box. Liked the Waterproof feature so when my daughter is Kayaking, she does not have to worry about it getting wet. The upload feature to Facebook or other sites was also great to quickly add information to sites. While the resolution is not the hightest in the class, it is good enough for quick videos for a device that slips into your pocket.

..

6006840060008 Use this to video offshore fishing in the Gulf. WOW!! The videos were great. Easy to shoot, and easy to hook-up to TV and replay. Didn't have to worry about salt water and fishing hands. Just rinsed it off. The best sdhc cards I've used in it are PNY Class 10's, 20mb/s. The sandisk extreme did not want to format. There are optional lenses available, and they work. The wide angle worked great on boat.

..

6006840060008 We bought our camera for vacation and love it!!! The only disappointing thing is that we could not use it to video inside some attractions because of lack of lighting.

..

..

6006840060008 This is a really fun device to play with, very versatile and easy to use. Do not expect something "professional" but this totally is up to the challenge to most of the other cameras out there.

..

6006840060008 Purchased to use during our Carribean vacation...even though it did lock up during usage at a show I managed to get in working condition in time for our sting ray and snorkeling outing. It worked to my expectation and then some!!! Easy to use; light weight and for the price what else can you expect??? Some other vacationers with expensive cameras were jealous :-) They had issues with batteries, view finder, ease of use and camera weight. Can't wait for next underwater experience!!!

..

6006840060008 Takes fast photo's, great underwater pics, Used it for a wedding and it took great video.

..

6006840060008 We purchased this camera because of its underwater capability (up to 3m) and use it during our Hawaiian vacation to film our snorkling excursions. It did great in filming land scenes during a variety of activities and the features and quality of video is outstanding. However, once I got it into the water, to film some great looking fish along a shallow reef, the camera froze up! None of the buttons would work and the camera would not turn off even after rinsing thoroughly in fresh water per the instructions. I noticed that the LCD display was discolored due to the seepage of moisture and the camera lens had water droplets condensed all over it. The camera also got very hot at this time. I opened the SDHC memory card door to get the flash card out and when I blew into it, a spray of water blew back onto my face. I finally got the camera to turn off by pressing the "reset" button per instructions found in the manual. It took over 24 hrs to evaporate all the water in the camera and return the LCD display to normal coloration. I was disconcerted by the fact that the user's manual anticipates this water leakage and gives trouble-shooting instructions on what to do--but that did not work! When I put the charger on the camera it again would not turn off unless I pressed the reset button. Also, the latch on the memory card door will now not close and is stuck in the open position. I went online and discovered that these symptoms are common to this camera (e.g., refer to reviews under "black" version of this camera). The camera is useless now and my only hope is to buy a separate memory card reader to extract the approximate 4 hrs of land video and still pics that are on the Class 10, 32GB memory card. If this does not work, then all our vacation activities (which included a helicoper tour, zip lining and sight seeing to beaches and the volcanoe) will be lost. By the way, our son bought the same camera and took it to Maui for their 10th wedding anniversay and the same exact thing happened to him: fine on land but once in the salt water the camera froze up. Fortunately, we were able to tell them what happened so they took HD video camera back-up with them (we did not). Do not buy this camera unless you intend to use it ONLY for filming HD on land for which it performs extremely well. The fair rating is primarily because this camera cannot be used for its advertised underwater use. Very disappointing and frustrating for a Kodak product. We are returning ours for a refund.

..

6006840060008 I bought this to take on my family's trip to Universal Studios and the Orlando area for vacation. It was extremely convient to slip into my pocket and carry around. Most people think it's a cell phone. I was fun to use in the pool and water parks. The battery life was decent and lasted entire days walking around theme parks. I stood in line with someone else who had purchased the black version before his trip and he seemed to be enjoying his.
The only complaint I have is the lack of a flash. The picture quality wasn't good under low light. I think a flash or some sort of light would have helped with that.

Sharing pictures has never been easier than with the M580 Digital Camera. Kodak's Share button lets you instantly tag pictures for uploading to YouTube, Facebook, Flickr and Kodak Gallery sites, plus e-mail too.Memory card sold separately.


..

6006840060008 I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday. He loved it! This camera had everything he wanted and it was at a great price. Tagging is great on it and the pictures are so crisp and easy to up load. Kodak easyshare is so much fun.

..

6006840060008 This was my first digital camera and was recommended by 2 few friends. It was very basic and easy to use. My only problem was when using outdoors on a sunny day I couldn't see anything on the LCD screen except a reflection of myself. It turned out that both of my friends had older versions of the EasyShare which also had viewfinders, but the newer version does not. I returned the camera and got a Canon with a movable LCD screen and a viewfinder.

..

6006840060008 The camera works very well. Sharp pictures and very little blurs. The only disappointment I had was that the commercial made it appear that the camera didn't have to be connected to a PC to load to wherever the user wanted to load it, which you do have to do once you've installed the software.

..

6006840060008 didn't like it. and my computer didn't like it. complicated.

..

6006840060008 Left in the camera, the battery goes dead in less than 3 days, have to make sure it's charged each time before you use it. My other Kodak cameras never had this problem. Also have to reset the time & date each time the battery dies. If you take the battery out, it stays up, so it's not the battery.

..

6006840060008 We had our first digital Kodak camera, CX7430, for almost 4 years, it was a great camera for only 4.0MP. We then bought a M1033, which we loved. It took great pictures and video, but ended up only lasting a year and a half. It stopped working and was too expensive to repair. So we bought this M580, and ended up getting our money back. The first one I had, had bad pixels on the view screen. It took terrible, blurry pictures. Also, had a hard time using the auto focus with room lighting. It took great pictures out in the sunlight. I decided to take it back and figured the first problem was a fluke, so I decided to try another one of the same model. It had the same problems!!! It seemed like a great buy, with lots of features for a low price, but it was just a terrrible experience and I probably will not buy another KODAK camera.

..

6006840060008 I bought the M580 to replace an old Kodak DX6490 4 megapixel model that I've used for 10 years and loved and to supplement my SLR. Took the M580 to Orlando for vacation and it took a few good pics and then stopped working. Maybe it was the humidity, but there's no excuse for the camera not powering on. When it decided to work again, the outdoor sunny pics were good quality, but not great. Indoor flash pics were not as good as my old Kodak.
I can't recommend this camera even though I'm a fan of Kodak. I'm returning it and will choose a Canon to match my SLR.

..

6006840060008 Overall I could rate this camera very high(IF IT WORKED)...I got this camera for my family vacation in June and it Worked AMAZING!!! I loved how easy to use...portable...GREAT pics! However.... a few days before vacation was over it stopped working (Would NOT turn on). I returned it to the store (had a two year warrenty) and they ordered me a new one and i got it a few days later. Took it home .... the pic quality was awful!!! Then one day it said " View obstructed, remove lens cap"......um! this camera has no lens cap!!! And then it wouldnt turn off! SO....I took it back again!!! I choose not to get it replaced and paid a little bit more for a Cannon Power shot SX120....its baulky but i have no complaints. great! i repeat GREAT!! pic quality and zoom. Video is amazing also. ...the Kodak is great if u dont want it to work when u need it and if u like to make frequent trips to the store for returns :)

..

6006840060008 My first digital camera was a Kodak, when that one broke I went to a Sony only to be disappointed, so for my next camera i went back to Kodak and got this one.
I am thoroughly impressed with this camera! The picture quality is excellent, I love the lens it uses. The camera is very compact and the 14 mega pixels is more than I need, and the zoom works great. The different scenes are fantastic, it has something for every type of shot I want. My favorite is the panoramic shot, It looks awesome and is really easy to use.
This camera is also very advanced, I love the face detection and the camera's ability to detect and tag faces, I also appreciate the fact you can switch between a red eye pre-flash or red eye digital correction.
Overall I love this camera, and I am very glad I switched back to Kodak!

..

6006840060008 I've had Kodak film and digital cameras for years and never steered away from them because of their great quality and ease of use cameras until i purchased this Kodak M580. I purchased this camera about 1 months before a trip to Las Vegas and because of my trust in Kodak i put the camera away for my trip and continued using my older Kodak camera ( not a smart idea on my part ). Trip came and the M580 came out with horrible grainy, blurry and out of focus pictures no matter what i did ! I tried different setting, tripod and even letting someone else take the pictures and nothing. I would say 7 out of every 10 pictures were unusable, which is odd because id never had a problem with a Kodak camera. I figured it to be defective and switched it out for another one of the same model and it to gave me the same results. So having had this bad experience with Kodak i decided to finally move on from them and i would SUGGEST YOU DO NOT BUY KODAK till they bring back the quality they once had.

Record special moments with this camcorder that features high-definition video playback for vibrant images and a Share button and pop-out USB arm for easy file transfer, so you can e-mail videos and photos to friends or post them online.


..

6006840060008 I like this camera, and have fun with it in the pool and in other water sports. The camera is not great, however, for normal use out of the water.

..

6006840060008 Great little cam ... The kids have had it in the pool at least 20 times. Works great when mounted in the car. Easy to use, easy to operate.

..

6006840060008 Water under the screen first time in water, kiddie pool. What a joke.

..

6006840060008 this work well for us and is our only vid camara (takes stils as well for a bonus). We can take vids on cards then store the cards with lables so we have a "perminate record" for insurance etc. Also take vids for fun and move the vids to the computer HD or to the clowd. I thought an internal HD would be a better deal -- not so you can get many hours of vid on a 16 gig card
Good value, simple to use, we like it.

..

6006840060008 Got this and the "non" waterproof Playful for my birthday. Took this one to mexico with us on our vaca, and it took great video outside and in the pool! I just wanted a reasonably priced portable water proof video camera, small enough to carry around for spontaneous videos, and that's exactly what I got! Easy to carry, Easy to use, took it on wave runners and got great still pics also! Love it for what it is.

..

6006840060008 I am a camp lead over the summer for a swimming camp and I let the kids take this into the water as a reward. They have to rotate turns so it's fair and they all really enjoy seeing hat they look like under the water. I think it is a great tool to have and have recommended it to many others already.

..

6006840060008 I received an email today requesting feedback.
This camera arrived very quickly and we were excited to use it. I trust Kodak. It was the only brand of camera that my parents bought while I was growing up and one of my favorite gifts as a child was a Kodak camera for my 8th grade graduation.
After taking video in a 6 ft depth pool for about an hour, the camera shut down. The instructions indicated that this is normal (???) and advise the customer to open all of the "doors" and leave it open to dry.
Done.
Fast forward one month.
The camera not only doesn't play the video taken on the first day, it doesn't work at all.
I am disappointed in the product. I would not suggest purchasing this camera to anyone I know.

..

6006840060008 Just okay. Just an average, beginner-type product. Don't expect it to last long for what I paid for it.

..

6006840060008 Used 1 time and the screen was distorted from water. Glad I got my SD card out and was able to save that.

..

6006840060008 I purchased this camera for my son for his 8th birthday. The first thing we did was take it to the pool, where he used it under very close supervision for nearly four entire minutes before it stopped working. There is water underneath the screen, inside the memory compartment, underneath the plastic lens cover, and everywhere else there isn't supposed to be water. This camera was a huge disappointment.

Get up-to-date weather information for more than 60,000 locations in the U.S. and Canada with this weather forecaster that provides up to a 4-day forecast, including chance of precipitation, hours of sunshine and wind speed so you can plan accordingly.


..

6006840060008 I should have researched this more before buying it. I wanted something that would give me (in order of importance) the outside temp, the inside temp, and a 1-2 day forecast. This does all that, but the outside temp isn't readily visible...you have to wait for it to scroll across at the bottom - AFTER the forecast or any weather advisories/watches/warnings scrolls across.

..

6006840060008 A little over-priced. Would prefer brown wood rather than red wood for the frame. It's a bit slow waiting for the words to roll across the screen. Otherwise, excellent info.

..

6006840060008 
This weather forecaster provides audible forecasts and plays your choice of news headlines, entertainment, sports and more so you can prepare for your day. 4-day weather conditions with daily high and low temperature forecasts help you plan accordingly.


..

6006840060008 Gave this as a gift and it was a big hit. Forecast and large display windows are nice features.

..

6006840060008 Have only had this product a couple of days. So far it's working great. Was very easy to set up and is very easy to use. One of the main reasons I purchased this was because I wanted a weather station that would display both indoor and outdoor temperatures. I checked out several different weather stations, and decided on this one. I should have checked the manufacturers website...the LCD does NOT toggle between time, date and indoor temperature as stated in the product description on the Best Buy site. That is my only complaint so far with this product.

..

6006840060008 My husband works in the snow removal business and this product lets us know what the weather is in areas other than our own. Saves unnecessary trips in the middle of the night!

..

6006840060008 I had been wanting a weather station for some time, and found this one after doing some research. It has a stream-lined, easy-to-read display that is not cluttered with lots of information I don't care about or even understand (barometric pressure readings?). It was fairly simple to hook-up to the internet and my router, and I was able to get it registered with no problem. It has the ability to report on five different locations (for a small fee good for the lifetime of the device), so I can keep up with the weather across the country wherever my family lives - very cool!
The audio forecast uses a computerized voice, which isn't too bad, but it is prone to clipping off the end of sentences and mispronouncing the names of cities and other words in the available audio feeds. Speaking of audio feeds, don't buy this for the news, sports, etc... feeds; the selection is poor and consists of the computer voice reading from short news articles. But if you want a desktop weather station with a small footprint, which also serves as a clock and calendar, this device may be for you.

With the LaCie CloudBox, you've got everything you need for storage and backup. Just copy and paste your most files to your CloudBox, and they will automatically be backed up online daily. It's that simple: your data is backed up on a local hard drive and again in the cloud for double protection. The CloudBox includes a one-year online backup contract for 100GB, which can be easily renewed.


..

6006840060008 I work from different locations and I often need to have my data available no matter what. This is why I purchased the CloudBox. Apart from a 100GB NAS drive with automatic backup software you get a very nice pro cloud backup service (also 100GB). I felt it was a pretty good deal. It's for sure less expensive than other cloud services that I've used in the past. The data is conveniently available anywhere in the world from any computer with a connection to the Internet. The data is encrypted and password-protected, of course. This solution is ideal for my work.

..

6006840060008 I purchased this network drive only recently, but I already feel very positive about it. After the files are copied to the drive, I can turn off my computer and relax. The Cloudbox automatically backs up my data to the Cloud after encrypting it (128-bit encryption). To set all of this up one doesn't have to have any specialist knowledge. The only thing one needs to do is to set up the software which is supplied with the drive. It's a very convenient and secure backup solution!

Style and set your hair with this Laila Ali LADR5604N1 dryer that features a soft bonnet and ionic technology to dry a variety of hair styles, as well as process chemical and conditioning treatments. An included case offers compact storage.


..

6006840060008 Compact hair dryer with bonnet is a great space saver. I purchased to replace my broken hood dryer. The bonnet dryer works great. It gets very hot and dried my hair quickly. The drawback would be the hose seem a bit short therefore making it hard to move around and turn your head while drying. Also the locking mechanism for keeping the hose attached to the dryer doesn't work very well. When turning my head while sitting under the dryer the hose became detached a few times. That was annoying because I had to keep placing it back in. Not easily done since the hose gets very hot. But overall it works great, its portable and doesn't take up a lot of space.

..

6006840060008 I needed something that can dry my hair quick. Well it works awesome!! I check out a few hair dryer and decided on this one. The color of is nice to look at. Laila did a good job on choosing the color of this dryer. It along with what it say it could do, sold me on it.. If you want a dryer that can travel with you and dry your hair quick, This is the Dryer to get. The only problem to me is the hose is a little short. Other then that Great Bonnet Hair Dryer!!!

..

6006840060008 A great product. I love it that I can move around while my hair is drying and not having to sit still.

This ceramic heater features 2 heat settings, a fan-only setting and an adjustable thermostat for custom comfort. The carry handle and compact size offer versatile tabletop or floor use.


..

6006840060008 I purchased this heater for my office. It definitely keeps me warm.

..

6006840060008 This is a compact heater which generates satisfying amount of heat considering its size. Because of its size it is very handy to be carried everywhere in the house. I purchased it to replace my old tower oscillating heater which only blows cool air without generating any heat (actually according to the online reviews this is quite a common problem for those types of heaters). It does not have tilt protection though, but that is not a problem for me. However, comparing with my previous tower heater, I will have to put it on top of a stool to heat up the area about half of my height. But consider its price, it is quite worth buying.

..

6006840060008 Great product. I use it in living room in an apartment and within 30 min to 1 hr it heats up the room with from (67 to 72F). Less noisy than other traditional heaters. Very comfortable when using it during night times when you need to sleep in your room.

..

6006840060008 Great for a small space,can be set to a certain temperature so it doesn't overheat. Is easy to operate and move from place to place

..

6006840060008 Produces the perfect amount of warmth for a bathroom without central heat. Compact size makes it unobtrusive when not in use.

..

6006840060008 This little heater is well worth the money. It is small, even smaller than expected but boy does it warm a room. It gets the room so warm sometimes I wish it had a timer. I use it in a one bedroom apartment, and it gets the rooms pretty warm ( the main room that it's in and any other rooms with doors open). I can have my apartment's thermostat turned down and as the room warms up the thermostat shows the temperature is increasing. Great investment, and even with a cold winter my electric bill is to my liking.

..

6006840060008 I bought this for my daughter to use in her apartment. This heater works great in a small area.

..

6006840060008 its a great product to have and it heats up pretty quickly. can save heating costs. easy to use,

..

6006840060008 it is a great little heater I would tell others its a good heater for a small room

..

6006840060008 Despite the low humming noise it makes while working, this heater does a great job heating up a room! No need to max it as it will get very hot! And the thermostat works wonderfully. Definitely recommended!

..

6006840060008 
Stay warm with this heater that delivers concentrated warmth for a comfortable personal space with automatic overheat protection and a cool-touch housing to protect your home.


..

6006840060008 Compact in size, fair price, arrived within promised time. No set up required other than finding right spot to position it. Good value for money

..

6006840060008 I bought this heater to set on my desk at work. Its quiet, very small, and perfect for a desk top. For the price, it was a really great purchase. Keeps me warm while I work. The only thing that would make it better is if it had a few more features like a high low switch, and possibly an auto shut off safety feature. Otherwise, excellent little heater.

6006840060008 I just purchased this drive to use with my Lenovo IdeaPad Yoga 13. The description says it was designed for the IdeaPad notebook, which is why I chose this one. It comes with Corel Burn.Now software to be used for burning CD/DVD's, however, the software is not compatible with Windows 8! I verified this with the Corel support representative who suggested I purchase a different application. So, I will likely return this product to get something that comes with a compatible user interface application.

As a business professional on the go, it's important that you ensure the work you do on your netbook or notebook is secure and protected. And with a busy lifestyle, there's no time for the hassle and complexity of a traditional backup solution, and no room to carry an external hard drive and cables with you. Developed with this in mind, the Lexar Echo MX backup drive is an easy-to-use, ultra-portable drive with capacity meter, which provides a convenient way to quickly and automatically back up and protect your files on the go. The drive is available in 8GB, 16GB, 32GB, 64GB, and 128GB capacities.


..

6006840060008 I bought my Lexar Echo MX USB drive primarily for storage capacity. With 128GB, it more than fulfills my requirements for a flash drive. I don't use the backup software so I can't review that aspect of my purchase, but I'm sure it works fine. I believe it came formatted in the FAT32 file system, but I formatted it anyway using the HP USB Disk Storage Format Tool,, v. 2.1.8. See my review of the Lexar 64GB USB drive and Windows 7/exFAT/FAT32 file system issues for USB drives larger than 32GB. It wasn't that long ago when an external hard drive requiring a USB cable had a 16GB limit, so technology has come a long way in a short period of time.
If you're looking for a quick, easy, lightweight backup/storage option for your laptop (or even desktop, if you still use one), you can't go wrong with this device. I don't really like the sliding cover for the connector so I use a cap from another USB flash drive to keep it protected. The storage indicator bar showing how much space you have used and have left to go is really helpful, as well. If you think the $140 cost is pricey, consider that this USB drive originally cost $500 when it first came out.

Enjoy arresting home entertainment with this LG 32LN520B HDTV that features 720p resolution and LED backlight technology for bright, clear, vibrant images. Virtual surround sound technology delivers immersive, realistic audio.


..

6006840060008 I bought this TV for the basement to watch it during the workout. Initially I was upset that this TV does not have an audio output - usually LED TVs don't have good speakers - but this one is producing a pretty good sound. The picture is very good too. Simple remote control. Does what it supposed to.

..

6006840060008 Used as a reception area TV so we're probably not too critical. Only issue is the wall mount on the back of the TV is recessed so my existing mount did not work. I had to buy a new mount (costing 25% as much as TV!).

..

6006840060008 excellent low cost choice. good picture despite low pixels. cheaper then local sears too.

..

6006840060008 I needed a low cost TV for a family member and this one was perfect. Looked good and worked great.

..

6006840060008 This is our first move to a LED TV and we like it. We started out with the 22", but found it was just too small, then the 32" came up on sale at only $50 more so we bought it. It is hard to evaluate the HD features of this TV as we do not have HD on our cable and have not watched any HD movies via our computer. There is an HDMI port to which I have hooked up my computer to watch a movie (non HD) and it worked great. For some reason our DVD player will not work with this TV, but it could be because it is so old. I find the picture a little dark at times and have switched preset types (usually on cinema and vivid, sometimes standard). I have not experimented with the color beyond that as it seems fairly complex. I really haven't noticed the visual blur you can get with a 60Hz LED TV (there was a fair amount of visual blur on the 22", also 60 Hz). I have watched the Super Bowl on it as well as the Winter Olympics. (I do not know if HD sports will have more blur as I haven't watched any HD sports so far.) So, if you are looking for a less expensive TV with a good to great picture quality, then this is the TV for you. Before I bought this TV I researched manufacturers and LG came up as one of the better ones in Consumer Reports. So far I have not been disappointed, but it has only been 3 weeks. There are the following connections available: component/composite, HDMI, USB, and cable/antenna (RF). There is no connection for external speakers or headphones. The reason I rated the features at 3 is because there is no connector for headphones/external speakers (when it was advertised as having them) and there is no direct internet connection, you have to access through your PC.

..

6006840060008 Easy to set up, great picture for the money and can find nothing wrong with it. Has good number of inputs.

..

6006840060008 Gift for family a great price wish I would have got bigger love the picture good quality

..

6006840060008 This tv is great for a bedroom when it isn't in that much use. It is overall a good product for the money!

..

6006840060008 I first tried a Vizio 32" --very poor quality; tuner very poo functionr with a cable box; --returned it
The LG is a first class set; well built; excellent electronics

..

6006840060008 This TV is perfect for those wanting basic functions for a TV located in a secondary room. Has pretty good picture quality and average sound

Take your Apple iPhone 4 or 4S with you wherever you go in this LifeProof case that features a full IP-68 rating and has been designed to military specifications to ensure protection against water, dust, impacts and shock.


..

6006840060008 This does what it says. I've jumped in to a lake with my phone in my pocket and my phone is perfectly fine!

..

6006840060008 Other than screen cover bubbles it does what it's suppose to.

..

6006840060008 This is actually my second one, the last one was with my iPhone and I left it on the back of my truck, I found my phone about a mile down the road and was ran over more than once and in the rain,, the cover protected my phone with minimal damage, highly recommend this case.

..

6006840060008 I'm happy with the case. Phone seems protected. I've put it through it's paces (short of throwing it on the ground) and the phone hasn't had any issues. The case takes the brunt of everyday use and looks to protect against occasional extreme missteps as well.

..

6006840060008 This case helps you not to worry about getting your phone wet or if you drop it. It's not that bulky and fits in your pocket. Price is a little high but it is worth it.

..

6006840060008 What an amazing product. Lost my iPhone5 by dropping it in the ocean, so I now use Lifeproof! This is an awesome case and it is 100% genuine. Sooooo many fakes and counterfeits on eBay. Yes it is about $80 bucks but how much is a new phone? BUY THIS CASE AND IGNORE ALL OTHERS!

..

6006840060008 It was easy to put together. My son loves the color. It seems to be holding up great! I can't always hear when a call or text comes in but volume is fine when talking. Overall great value and seems to do what it says!

..

6006840060008 My son bought this case to protect our old iphone that was given to him and it has been a great investment.

..

6006840060008 Worth the cost. A couple of years ago my oldest son jumped in a pool with his phone in his pocket and no lifeproof case; ruined the phone. A week ago my youngest son did the same thing with this case on his phone and no damage done.

..

6006840060008 Life proof case works great. Underwater pictures are awesome!!

The LS-60 programmable communicating thermostat operates via a high-quality, easy-to-use touch screen. To program or adjust your LS-60, simply touch your finger firmly to the screen. The screen will automatically light up and you will hear a "beep." Do not use a sharp or metallic device; it will scratch the screen.


..

6006840060008 I do love this thermostat. Was about to pay the same price for one that wasn't even wifi compatible. I can set different programs for every day of the week or for a set of days. My old thermostat only would let you set a specific program for days, and then one other for weekends. I was always having to adjust the settings. I also think that the temperature gauge on it had expired. The temperature never seemed right. It was either too cold or too hot. This one seems to get it right. Follow directions exactly if you are going to add the wifi modlule. It can only be setup through Lockstate Connect. I tried doing the free route and no it does not work !! Finally I only gave it 4 stars due to the fact that there should be some sort of base around the whole unit. It looks strange when it's mounted.

Cool to the max:You can keep your cool thanks to the virtually silent, tilted fan with a large grill.Very comfy:More comfort when using your laptop on the couch, bed or floor.Low energy:The USB-powered fan uses minimal energy to help save your laptop battery for the things you want to do.


..

6006840060008 The product works as advertised and the price was right. Don't know enough about the differences in other cooling pads to say whether it would or would not be worth it to pay for additional features. From my perspective, this product works and that's what I was looking for.

..

6006840060008 My cooling fan helps a lot in keeping my computer from over heating.

..

6006840060008 Its easy to set up, your computer will work better, cause it will be always in a Good temperature.

..

6006840060008 This pad runs great! The fan is really quiet. It plugs into the computer for power. My husband liked mine so much he went out and purchased one for himself. I would highly recommend this product!

..

6006840060008 Had this for about 6 months. It worked great during that time, but one day it stopped working. The problem is that the cable is frayed by the selector switch. Have to play with the cable to get the fan to turn on.

..

6006840060008 3rd one i bought - they break kind of easy and so it's a little pricey for a piece of plastic

..

6006840060008 My laptop always ran hot. With this product, nice and cool. The cord stays out of the way. Laptop does not slide and stays put on my lap. Great product for the price.

..

6006840060008 It does what it is suppose to. Plus the bonus of being able to turn it off and on without having to disconnect and adjustable speeds are a very nice bonus.

..

6006840060008 I have used it both on a table and also used In bed. Works great to keep your legs cool by moving air around if the laptop is on your lap

..

6006840060008 Excellent at keeping your laptop cool and running efficient. Great price for the craftsmanship.

A laser mouse with hyper-fast scrolling and a keyboard with an integrated LCD give you the speed you need. And the control you crave


..

6006840060008 Well I owned this set now about 3 yrs. It is still working just as good as the first day out of the box. Ths cutomization for the keyboard and mouse are great. I have had to change the batterys in the keyboard once since i bought it, the mouse lasts about 5 days before you need to put it in the charger. I do really like this set-up for a desktop. Doesn;t work very well for laptop use. the keyboard is quite large along with the mouse. I does work on a blanket which was a nice surprise. It is a bit costly for what you get but if you purchase on sale then it is a good deal.

..

6006840060008 A lot of extra bells and whistles.(shortcuts) not necessarily for the non-geek, lol, but it does work great!

..

6006840060008 As a professional photographer, videographer and graphic artist of 48 years and a computer user since the Atari 1600, I can say I have never used a keyboard or mouse that was better than these. Well worth the money.

..

6006840060008 I love this product and it works well on my computer - had no trouble with set-up, but six months after purchase, the "mouse critical" power icon came up and after 24 hours of charging, I could not get it to stop sending me the message. E-mailed Logitech and since it was still under the manufacturer's warranty, they sent me a completely new set (including keyboard), no questions asked, and technical support was very helpful and pleasant to deal with. Another seven months goes by - same problem. Now it's out of warranty and I'm either going to have to purchase another one or buy a different model. Haven't decided what to do about that yet. It would also be helpful if the LED function on the top of the screen had some back lighting. Would recommend, but with reservations.

..

6006840060008 I use this setup to control my laptop while connected to my HDTV from across the room. Works well at distance (connectivity) but seemed to be a tiny delay with the mouse, which is fine for normal computer use but I play video games so the delay is painful. Very satisfied with the battery life on the mouse and the rechargeable nature.
Very satisfied with the setup.

..

6006840060008 I'm an average user and so far is been great in meeting my expectations but for the price should be better, in terms of the screen not being in color and while the lights are off hard to see the keys on the keyboard and screen! but mouse being rechargeable was a nice touch. Battery life is very good and if you have the extra money to spend I don't think you will find any better!

..

6006840060008 Gamers or people who have their computers connected to their TV need to get this keyboard/mouse combo. I'm like 10 feet from the computer and have no issues. The shipping was super fast to an APO, took like a week to get here.

..

6006840060008 Great keyboard and mouse. I'm connected with Bluetooth, and it works great! Initially I was getting some disconnect issues, but I played around with the computers "sleep" settings, and I'm happy to report that solved the issue.
The price is a bit steep, but you get what you pay for here. I had a MS wireless keyboard and mouse, and it had a radius of about 5 ft. which was worthless for my home theater setup. This keyboard/mouse puts my previous wireless setup to shame.
I've had this up and running for over a week now, and the mouse hasn't needed a single recharge even with heavy use. The keyboard isn't rechargable, but it appears it'll go roughly 180 days before needing new batteries (according to the on-screen estimate). Incredible!
Zero complaints other than the screen on the keyboard being nearly useless in a very dark setting... However, it works great in normal lighting.

..

6006840060008 This keyboard and mouse have worked without any problems. I have a new computer with windows 7 home premium 64 and the keyboard and mouse were very easy to connect.

..

6006840060008 The mx Revolution is an awesome mouse which is why I bought this setup, but it's old technology that doesn't use a micro usb to charge during use like the mx performance. The keyboard is pretty typical for logitech. Great feel and useful extras, but the whole setup at like $180 is far too much. A better setup is a g15 keyboard and a g5 mouse which is what I ended up with after returning these items. The wireless novelty just isn't worth it.

Change the grip. Change the weight. Customize the LEDs. Even use on board memory to take up to five mouse profiles with you to the next LAN party. In every way, the G9 mouse lets you tune for the way you play.


..

6006840060008 I am a fairly avid WoW player and I used a G9x for two years. The first year, the mouse was great! Suddenly, in the second year, the mouse began freezing and hesitating. After doing several on line searches, I found that others were experiencing the same issues. The wire that enters the mouse from the USB has a very bad habit of breaking and causing issues such as mine. I don't mind this so much in a $15 generic mouse, but in an $80 gaming device, I expect more.

..

6006840060008 I have been using this mouse for a long time now, and wanted to validate my initial thoughts of the product before writing a review on it.
What i use the mouse for:
First person shooters on the PC, and XBOX 360 (via a device called xim3), simple computer browsing and navigation.
Adjustable DPI: Being able to change the sensitivity on the mouse on the fly is a great feature and i use it frequently. I change my sensitivity (the DPI button) to max in games, and adjust the sensitivity in the game itself in order to achieve the best tracking and accuracy. Then i can turn it down a notch on the mouse if i want to navigate a computer and have more control with the mouse pointer and clicking on things. The button used to change the DPI is not in the way of accidentally getting pushed, and i think they placed the button in a good spot. This feature also works when connected to the xim3 for the xbox 360.
weights: In my opinion, as a first person shooter type of gamer, i like the ability to pick up a mouse and move it with ease. I found it easier to use the mouse without the included weights. some people may prefer weights for different applications like auto CAD though.
Interchangeable mouse covers: i can't see a benefit or downside of using one over the other. I believe this falls under user preference. I do notice that after some time of using the textured cover, that the texture will rub off.
adjustable mouse wheel: you can change the mouse wheel to either floating, or "notched" where it clicks into place if you slide it up or down. Floating design is good for applications that require lots of scrolling, and the wheel has great bearings and will spin for a long time if you let it. The notched or clicking setting for the mouse wheel is good for games as you feel it click once to change weapons, which means you have more control.
the side buttons: there's two side buttons near the thumb that are used for navigating forward and backward from site to site if surfing the web, or you can assign them to funcitons in games. These buttons i feel are the weakest part of the mouse. After semi-average use, there is no distinct way to tell that there is a forward and back button. it feels like one single button, and the button itself is real wobbly and feels like it is going to fall out. due to this, it's difficult to get the mouse to register which button you want, and you sometimes find yourself accidentally pushing the wrong one.
Overall, i feel this mouse is absolutely great for the price, and is better than the G500 due to the fact you can change the DPI on the fly as opposed to logging into the mouse software to change it like you have to do on the G500. The only down side is the side buttons near the thumb seem cheaply engineered and could have been made better.

..

6006840060008 The price is a little on the high side, however now that they dropped the price down to $80 instead of $99 it is better.
I have very large hands so the mouse is a little on the small side for me, but it is still extremely comfortable to use and is more comfortable than any other mouse I have used.
The mouse has a nice look to it, you can tell it is a high performance mouse but it is not so flashy that people will really notice if you use it with your work computer, unlike razer or cyborg mice...
The dpi selection buttons are easy to find and use without looking and aren't in the way like with some mice. The thumb buttons are also nicely placed. While sometimes i think it would be nice to have the profile select and microgear buttons on the top/side of the mouse for ease of access, it is nice that they aren't in the way and don't accidentally get hit during regular use.
Overall, the mouse is great, the woven usb cable is a nice touch as is the changeable led color.
The program that comes with the mouse is very easy to use, plus it is very nice to not have to set it up on every computer you hook the mouse to. My only other real complaint is that you can only adjust settings on the mouse from one computer without erasing the settings and starting over, this was annoying at first but once I got the mouse setup the way I wanted it was nolonger an issue.

..

6006840060008 Positives:
I don't use this mouse for gaming, but I usually buy gaming mice because I require more precision for what I do. I have small-medium sized male hands and tend to use a claw/finger grip and lift/swipe the mouse. I previously used the Logitech MX-300 and the G3, which fit my hands perfectly. This G9 mouse is slightly smaller than those but has more buttons and works well for me, as it has two grips, one that is more ergonomic and slightly bigger and one that is slightly smaller and more angular. The grips and weights are very easy to change. Both main buttons click excellently, the wheel has a nice ratcheting scroll (which can be switched off to allow smooth scrolling), the dpi buttons (which are reprogrammable) are placed well and click firmly, and the same can be said for the side buttons. The Setpoint software works great as usual and allows maximum customization and flexibility in and out of applications (important since I don't use the mouse for gaming, but for windows and application usage). The mouse glides and tracks like a dream.
Negatives:
I don't use the weights as the mouse is already relatively heavy - it is not a light mouse like the G3 or even the MX-300 which had a weight inside. They should've made the mouse lighter without the weights installed for those who prefer a much lighter mouse. The middle button is difficult to depress and doesn't offer a satisfying click. The microgear button (to switch from ratcheting to free scrolling) should've been placed on the top of the mouse for on-the-fly access. The mouse is too small for those with larger hands who use a palm grip, but is perfect for smaller/medium hands or those who use claw or finger grips. Logitech should've provided different sized grips so that everyone could find a good fit (both grips provided are basically the same size). The retail price of about $100 is way too high, IMO, esp since it doesn't come with more grips.
Overall
Despite some minor drawbacks, this mouse is excellent for those who have small-mid size hands and/or use claw/finger grip, and who require a very precise, slick-gliding mouse with many programmable buttons.

..

6006840060008 I had been using a cheesy Microsoft mouse for playing fps, My Logitech MX5000 mouse was horrible playing fps. I did pretty well with the cheap Microsoft mouse so I didn't think this would change much. Boy was I wrong. The first round of MW2 I played with this mouse my k/d ratio went sky high. Nothing can compare to how smooth this mouse works.
Once I dialed in the changeable weights it got even better.
Being able to create profiles for each of your games is awesome. As soon as you launch the game it will automatically load the mouse profile for that game including custom macro buttons.
The programmable macro buttons are also super helpful. If you u se 3 round burst assault rifles you can program the macro buttons to make them fully automatic.
Don't kid yourself this mouse is worth every penny.

..

6006840060008 after switch over 17 mouse, this is my final one, the 18th mouse for gaming.
A Good mouse is really required for FPS(First Person Shooting) gaming, after i had so many mouses, this is the one i have finally found that can work with my hand with the right speed, sentive, and comfortable. i will tell you EVEN if this mouse is selling for $199 and i will still buy it.

..

6006840060008 This mouse model has been around for some time. Now that the G9X model is out, this price makes the deal even better.

..

6006840060008 Logitech has another hit on its hands. I upgraded from the G9 mouse not expecting much of a difference but the are some minor improvements from the previous version, including a software feature called angle snapping that helps in moving the mouse in a straight line either horizontally or vertically. I love the high DPI which can be changed on the fly with ease. I also like the changeable grips, and my favorite is the textured grip.
The only bad things I can say about it are the fact that its pretty pricey, and having the microgear button on the bottom still isn't great, since I rarely use it due to its location. I wish Logitech had found a different location for the button, as it is in the same spot on the G9.
Overall I highly recommend this mouse.

..

6006840060008 i got this mouse because its fast and looks good. this mouse is not 5000 dpi. ITS 5700 dpi. it has three settings and 2 cover for big and small hands. it has weight asjustment to it and it has a front and back key when you are surfing the web

..

6006840060008 Coming from a G5, this mouse feels more accurate and smoother. I love the configuration capabilities and have customized it extensively for my needs.
One of the features I didn't expect to use was the ability to turn off the Indent on the scroll wheel. This has proved invaluable while writing software when dealing with several thousand lines of code! The Scroll of
The feel is extremely comfortable and the customizable weight is a must have! I set mine to the heaviest it can be. I just like the feel of the friction I get that way.
The cable is covered in a cloth mesh for added strength. If the longevity of my G5 is any indication this mouse should last for several years at least. This easily justifies the expense.

..

6006840060008 
When you're gearing up for battle, you never compromise. Not on your team, not on your weapons, and certainly not on your hardware. If you take your game play seriously, you want the Logitech G19 on your side.


..

6006840060008 I'm a gamer so I need the best gear. Logitech makes the best mice and keyboards, there is no debating that. The LD display lets you choose what you want to monitor, and reconizes profiles, such as call of duty, and 007 Bloodstone just to name a few. At $119.00 it is pricy, you can have a Razer at half the cost, but if you have the means get the Logitech and a Logitech mouse too, you won't be sorry.

..

6006840060008 Howdy,
The G19 is, by far, the best keyboard I have ever purchased. I built a flight simulator in the lower level of my home and the G19 was an excellent choice to add. I particularly like the lighted keyboard with G Tabs for quick access to flight controls. Also, the screen in the middle allows me to monitor the computer performance and keep track of the time in Zulu when I fly on Multi-Player with other Pilots.
My sincere thanks for an OUTSTANDING Product,
Roger

..

6006840060008 The keyboard is good but they could have done a better job on some of the profiles. World of Warcraft is very bland with only black and white lettering. One of the main reasons I got this keyboard was to watch movies or pictures on the built in screen while I was doing other things on the computer. After numerous emails back and forth, Logitech has acknowledged that this keyboard will not access media files located on a network storage device (NAS). All my media files are located on a western digital NAS so this keyboard refuses to acknowledge any of them. The only way I can play them is to directly copy the files over to my C drive which defeats the purpose of having a network storage.
With the popularity of lcd screens now days, this keyboard is way too expensive for the tiny little screen it comes with.

..

6006840060008 I love it. it does exactly what it is supposed to do. The background lighting on the keys is excellent. The color display is bright and very very handy in gaming.

..

6006840060008 I wanted to get this keyboard for 2 Months to upgrade from a Saitek Eclipse II. I love backlit keyboards so this was great for my desktop and I was getting tired of the eclipse that I've had for 2.5 years. The unit requires a separate power adapter for the lcd, the plug itself has a fat end like most routers/modems out nowadays .The KB looks amazing and you can change it whatever color you like, I loved the customization aspect. What was disappointing was that the KB isnt truly backlit (like for example Macbook Pro Unibody KB or Eclipse II) only the letters on the keys had illumination but not under the keys. It took me 30mins to realize why the KB didnt light up as bright as I thought it should. The LCD was not at all actually useful, there aren't any 3rd party apps or windows widgets/gadgets that are compatible with it. I thought it would be pretty cool to have the lcd, but realistically its not in your field of view which just makes it awkward. Setpoint software is needed as well as 2-3 more applications that must be installed and always running in the background in order for the lcd, custom keys and key color to work the way you want them to. If Logitech would partner up with Msoft for this, it would be somewhat better. Overall the software was pretty bad, eats up ram and core at all times and you must use the Media Browser with Media player, if MP is turned off the browser is useless. Another problem with the media browser is sometimes your movies and pictures open on the lcd screen when you dont want them to and its very annoying to turn them off. Dont plan on using iTunes when this keyboard is installed. Since it keeps WMP open at all times iTunes is a nightmare to navigate. Overall the G19 Is a very cumbersome keyboard because of SOFTWARE. I can forgive the power adapter because it actually feels good while typing, but the software kills any hope for this hardware to excel. Hope this was helpful to you

6006840060008 This is just a flat out great keyboard. It looks good, works well, and changes frigin colors! i also dig the macro keys (there are a ton of them).
key backlights are easy to see when gaming in a dark room.
acts as a 2 part USB hub which is handy for headset that use this connection as well as mice,r a MP3 player, or a flash drive.
my only beef with it is that it does not pitch up enough in the back for my typing tastes. in sure i will get used to it
also pricey, but you get what you pay for.

..

6006840060008 This keyboard has been by far the best I've ever used and does way more than I would ever need. I play online poker for a living, and it's really nice to have the 2" LCD display setup as my music player. It will display what song is next as well as what is currently playing on it's LCD screen. I find that beneficial as my monitors are generally covered in poker tables and it's nice to not have to interrupt my action in order to look up a song. Obviously this keyboard has some major functions designed for gaming that I will never use, but I highly recommend it to anyone just wanting a very nice keyboard.

..

6006840060008 I have had this keyboard for about a month now and I love the feel of it. This is my first "gaming" keyboard, so just getting used to having the extra two columns of keys on the left side of the board.
The LCD is great, depending on whether you want or need the info on the screen. If you watch your system resources (CPU, memory, etc), like to keep track of character stats, or if you are an RSS junkie, this is a good feature. I find that the movie watching and YouTube functionality of it offers little opportunity for use, but others may feel differently.
The keys are soft to the touch and don't make a lot of noise while you are typing. I am heavy-fingered and,with other keyboards, I have had several phone conversations where people commented on how loud I was typing. I don't have that issue at all with this keyboard. The keys are responsive. I have had none of the problems one of the other reviewers mentioned about keys sticking.
One of my favorite things about the keyboard is the back lit keys. I looked through several keyboards before purchasing this one. Many have the entire key panel back-lit which would make reading the keys (if you need to) more difficult. Only the character on the key is back-lit on this board. I also like that you have a tremendous color range to choose from and can bind up to three colors to the M-keys in the upper left corner of the board for when you just want a quick change of color.
The volume knob is nice. I like it better than the up/down volume keys on most keyboards. The mute button and media player control keys are all grouped together above the number pad, which is out of the way enough to not be invasive, but in a good enough spot to make them easily accessible without having to search for them.
The Windows-key lock feature definitely comes in handy for me. I have large fingers so mis-keying is a common occurrence. Nothing sucks worse than being in a boss fight or having someone in your cross-hairs and accidentally hitting that Windows-key, taking you out of the game.
I don't really like the height the keyboard adjusts to from flat. Would be nice to see either multiple heights or at least a little bit higher than what is currently provided. It's not much more angled than just being flat.
Should you buy this board? I think it depends on whether you are able to use and appreciate all of the functions of the keyboard. I have not really started using the G-keys yet (a little bit of a learning curve for me because I am used to binding macros to regular number or letter keys). I do not use the LCD as much as I expected, but just found some 3rd party software that may change that. Those two things being said, I don't have a full appreciation for the board just yet, but I definitely see the benefits. The comfort level for typing is really good (minus the limited height adjustment), but I am sure there are plenty of keyboards out there that are comparable. If you are a gamer and would make use of the G-keys, AND you would take advantage of the LCD fully, then this is a good board, otherwise you can probably find much cheaper alternatives.
I really like this keyboard and plan on taking full advantage of all of the features, so it's worth the money spent.

..

6006840060008 Keyboard has great feel for gaming, this keyboard does everything. The addition of ac. power gives you another upgrade over the g15. The color display sceen is actually quite useful in-game.

..

6006840060008 Keys get stuck, software messes up your computer, support sucks.

..

6006840060008 
There is sweat on your brow. And it's way too late to turn back. Everything is at stake. When you need to choose wisely, the Logitech Gaming Mouse G500 gives you a competitive edge with a gaming-grade laser, onboard memory, and weight tuning.


..

6006840060008 the mouseis great, the weight can be customized. The speed is very stable so you won't lose feel hard to control your pointer. It never lose frame.
Great with playing LOL and shooting games. In LOL, all the keys can be configured in the game.
Due to the big size, I don't recommend it for RTS gamers. My APM is 260+ and I prefer a smaller mouse such as G1 G100 or G100s for easier play multi-threads.

..

6006840060008 It is fast and smooth. Glad to be back on the logitech gaming mouse. The shape is excellent just like I remember. DPI indicator is useful.

..

6006840060008 This mouse has just the right number of buttons for games especially FPS games. The ability to adjust the speed on the fly is great when zooming in with a scoped rifle, slow and steady. The only thing I don't like about this mouse is the size, it's just a little small for my hand. Over all this is just the right mouse for everything and I will continue to buy this model whenever I need a new mouse.

..

6006840060008 It's a great gaming mouse with multiple useful buttons.
I like the dual-mode scroll wheel, super fast for web browsing and great for weapon switch in game.
The only problem I got so far is no response after computer booting. It may not be the mouse problem and re-plugging will fix it.
Wait, what's the point of this review if bestbuy removed it from stock list?

..

6006840060008 Great for any gamer, newbie or MLG PRO such as myself. Great mouse for MMO's and RPG's but a little to fast scroll for minecraft.

..

6006840060008 This is a very comfortable mouse to use. I still have not explored all of it's features yet though.

..

6006840060008 I love the feel of this mouse. It fits my hand perfectly and the weight is ideal.

..

6006840060008 I got this mouse to replace a dying Logitech wireless mouse to play games on my PC. I love the buttons to quickly select the dpi mode and the scroll wheel is wonderful, its nice to get back to the top of web pages when you're down at the bottom, it takes a little getting used to, but after a bit, you'll wish every mouse had it.

..

6006840060008 I have a Logitech MX500 that has lasted almost a decade and is still going strong. I purchased the G500 for an updated look and programmable buttons. It lasted 4 days before the sensor freaked out and would only work on the Y axis, wouldn't go left or right. The buttons stopped working as well. I plugged it into various USB ports and even a separate laptop with the same issue, it just bricked. I would expect a $60~ mouse to last longer than 4 days. While it worked, the DPI adjustments and programmable buttons were nice, but it wasn't that comfortable for me. I returned it to Best Buy and picked up the G700 instead. I like the design and feel of the G700 much better, so we'll see how long it lasts.

..

6006840060008 I was shopping around for an all around good gaming mouse and after going through several mice reviews between Razer, Steelseries, and logitech the G500 appeared to have the least negative remarks. So I picked up the G500 this morning and have been using it throughout the day. After installing the software I was amazed at the customization of the G500. If you choose not to install the software right away you can simply plug and play. The mouse has felt great to use all day and every button in my opinion just feels "right". I read a few complaints about the scroll wheel but I have not had any issue with it thus far. The DPI buttons are a great feature especially when you customize what DPI settings you want through the software manager. Mouse just glides over the mouse pad. I have no buyers remorse after purchasing this product, and would highly recommend to anyone wanting a great gaming mouse.

Enjoy a clear view of the display on your Apple iPad mini with this Logitech 920-005282 folio case, which doubles as a stand to allow comfortable hands-free viewing. The EasyType Bluetooth keyboard makes typing simple.


..

6006840060008 Love this product, it has meet and exceeded our expectations!!! I would recommend this to everyone!

..

6006840060008 It Safely secures IPad and Has A Great KeyBoard. Also keeps a great long battery charge!

..

6006840060008 I bought the keyboard folio the same day I purchased my iPad. I had been playing with a Surface tablet with keyboard that my school where I teach is letting me use and really liked the physical keyboard so I decided to get one with the new iPad. The folio offers outstanding protection when the iPad is not in use and allows for speedier typing when inputing information for various documents. I don't think it would be easy to use for a true typist - I use the old "hunt and peck" method so it works great for me. The iPad is held in position by a fairly strong magnetic strip and seats well even when typing with the folio sitting on my lap. There are several keyboard shortcuts specific to the iPad which makes the interface via bluetooth even easier. I am very pleased with this product.

..

6006840060008 Purchased Logitech Keyboard case for Ipad mini, she loves it. It fits good, keyboard works great with ipad and it keeps ipad secure when using keyboard or not.

..

6006840060008 Logitech makes an excellent keyboard. We love the size, the color, the feel and the functionality of this product. We highly recommend it to those looking for a keyboard and a protective case for their ipad minis.

..

6006840060008 turns your mini into a real computer. very easy to use

..

6006840060008 Works great, looks very good. Keys feel natural and comfortable. Highly recommend.

..

6006840060008 I have the iPad mini and this item protects the mini and works just like a keyboard should.

..

6006840060008 Love the ability to type like a computer. I just could not get the hang of typing efficiently on the iPad mini, as much as I love it.

..

6006840060008 I really like the iPad mini since it is easy to hold in one hand. I had another case (without the keyboard) and it wouldn't stand very well. This one is magnetic and stands well.

..

..

6006840060008 The keyboard is comfortable to use and the keys respond quickly to touch

..

6006840060008 This keyboard is great. I love the wave design. It really fits my hands great. I also like the detail of the where the base of my palms rest. It gives it a grip without being rough.

..

6006840060008 I like this keyboard a lot. Very comfortable to use for extended hours.

..

6006840060008 Quality Keyboard, offering many convenient shortcuts

..

6006840060008 The keyboard an mouse are easy to install. This keyboard allows you to be able to launch any program in Microsoft Office with ease.

..

6006840060008 bought for new computer, no wires, great price, does what it should.

..

6006840060008 As a programmer I type a lot and having a full sized ergonomic keyboard is important. The wave style layout is a little different from the natural keyboard i was used to, but it really does feel more natural. Give it a try.

..

6006840060008 Love it it works perfectly...... what more is there to say

..

6006840060008 this is a great keyboard for use when spending most of the day at the keyboard. comfort, speed as well as price are high on the list

..

6006840060008 Great Keyboard and Mouse this is my second one I had to Buy. The dropped the first one and the keys broke and one leg broke. So I came back to Best Buy and got another one. It was out of warranty. I didn't care I just like the Mouse and the Keyboard both are wireless and easy to reconnect .

Speed through documents and Web pages easily with this Logitech Marathon Wireless Mouse M705 910-001229, which features a scrolling wheel for fast navigation and a battery indicator light that lets you know when the batteries need to be changed.


..

6006840060008 I'm on my computer everyday for business & personal and this product makes moving thru my screens a snap. This is my first time owning a wireless mouse so I went out an d bought the wireless keyboard to go with it. I must say not being tethered to a CPU is great, I sometimes just relax back in my chair and surf the web, order products, write letters or bring up movies and conduct my business without the hassle of having to be in one place. Thank You Logitech

..

6006840060008 Would buy another one but probably wait for a sale. Easy to set up and program

..

6006840060008 My old mouse died and I wanted something to replace it. This is perfect! It's the right size and fit for my hand. It was a great find!

..

6006840060008 Works great with my Mac air. It was easy to sync to the computer also

..

6006840060008 While I think the mouse is excellent for general use or slower motion, I found it to be a bit too large for fast-paced first person shooters.

..

6006840060008 I purchased the best Logitech Mouse as a gift for a family member. I already own a Logitech Mouse and am very happy with the product.

..

6006840060008 I purchased this mouse to replace a Microsoft wireless mouse that had become erratic and unpredictable. This Logitech mouse has a much better, i.e., a more natural and comfortable, feel than my previous one. The controls are convenient yet not placed so that you will be triggering them by accident. Lightweight and nimble, this mouse has a useful and very easy to use feature that enables very fast scrolling. It did take me a while to adjust to the sensitivity and lighter touch compared to my previous mouse, but it has definitely been an improvement for me.

..

6006840060008 This is an excellent mouse for those who need something comfortable, easy to use, and smooth on all surfaces. the price is a little high, but worth every penny.

..

6006840060008 Great Mouse, really sensible and easy to use. It was really easy to install.

..

6006840060008 This mouse fits my hand very well and allows me to use it all day long at work comfortably. The scroll wheel is great for long web pages or excel documents. I love the buttons on this mouse, too. They're really useful. If you find its a bit fatiguing to use, try removing one of the two batteries for more comfort (it will work fine with just one battery).

..

Gaming Mouse G400 delivers rock-solid performance for when your sights are set on victory. A 3600 dpi optical sensor provides precision targeting and pinpoint accuracy, while in-game dpi switching lets you change the mouse's tracking characteristics to match the situation. Go from pixel-precise targeting (400 dpi) to lightning-fast maneuvers (up to 3600 dpi) without ever having to interrupt play. Full-speed USB communicates with the PC up to 1000 times per second for a nearly instantaneous response and super-smooth movement in games. Physical mouse movements translate to the same amount of cursor movement regardless of speed, and you get consistent tracking at any hand speed. Sculpted comfort grip, low-friction feet and eight programmable buttons keep you comfortable and in command. Optical gaming mouse requires a USB port, a Windows-based PC and is compatible with Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7.


..

6006840060008 the mouseis great, the weight can be customized. The speed is very stable so you won't lose feel hard to control your pointer. It never lose frame.
Great with playing LOL and shooting games. In LOL, all the keys can be configured in the game.
Due to the big size, I don't recommend it for RTS gamers. My APM is 260+ and I prefer a smaller mouse such as G1 G100 or G100s for easier play multi-threads.
Some player may be not satisfied with the right edge of the mouse, might feel inconvinient with the 4th finger, that may need time to get use to it, or G500 may be a good choice for you.

..

6006840060008 Great mouse, no really fault for the price I got it for. Does what its suppose to. I have somewhat of a big hand and it feels very comfortable in my hands when playing games.

..

6006840060008 I had the old model (MX518) and loved it. I used it for several years until the feet wore off of the bottom. Purchased this as a replacement and it is just as awesome.
Get it.

..

6006840060008 It is good for a first person shooter games and I like how you can ajust the dpi right from the mouse.

..

6006840060008 bought for use with a PS3 eagle eye controller. works flawlessly.

..

6006840060008 I'm a geek. Love being one. Asked my buddy which mouse I should upgrade to - (was using an extremely archaic roller-ball mouse from Dell.) Built a new computer a few years ago, so figured I should probably get a new mouse too...? LOL. Normal price for this mouse was $39.99 at the time of purchase - on sale for $27.99! "Great gaming mouse, without the high price" is the idea I got about it. Purchased at $27.99 and found out that a week later it was either discontinued or further on sale - ultimately, it cost $19.99 and BestBuy credited the difference back to my account (and i didn't even have to ask or inquire! Thanks so much BB!) I haven't been into the settings to change the dpi or anything (mainly because I haven't felt the need to) but the mouse itself feels amazing. Glides flawlessly with no resistance. Not glitchy or bulky - just all around a perfect buy! I AM glad that it was only $20, but knowing what I know about it now... $40 was not a bad asking price either. I recommend this for anyone that dabbles in games and isn't looking to drop $100 on a "name brand" gaming mouse. Happy hunting to all!

..

6006840060008 The G400 fits your hand well and has programable buttons to a point , it lacks the heft of the G500 and is missing two buttons, but I am pleased with my purchase! This is a great mouse for anyone who is fed up with the mediocre mouse your computer came with and want a responsive comfortable step above the mundane. Hey you can't beat $20.00 for a good mouse!

..

6006840060008 Great mouse for the price I got it for on sale at BB.

..

6006840060008 Needed a new mouse for my gaming pc. The G400 is highly rated and for good reason. While there are many excellent wireless mice, I still prefer wired -- no recharging, no dealing with batteries. I often feel that wired mice simply last longer. Best Buy's price beat out other online retailers, so it was a no-brainer for me.

..

6006840060008 This is the replacement for the mx-518. Both great mice! If you can still find either, buy them! I've always had great luck with Logitech mice and you can't go wrong with the G400. The comfort, durability, and logevity of these mice can't be beat!

..

6006840060008 
With the Logitech S315i multimedia speaker you'll never miss a beat. It plays a full day's (or night's) worth of music on a single charge. It's easy to take with you, and lets you enjoy every note as it was meant to be heard.


..

6006840060008 Returned this iphone speaker for the next model up S715i. The sound was just fair with not much bass. The larger model S715i has much better sound and great bass.

..

6006840060008 Best feature of this is the portability. Easy to unlug and shove in your backpack. Recharges your ipod / iphone while you listen, so long as it's plugged in. Good for a few hours of music on battery!
Sound quality isn't bad. I use it as my regular speakers for my laptop since it has a 3.5mm jack as well. Have used it a few times for parties on battery, everyone loved it. Can't control songs remotely or from speaker, but hey you can just use youre ipod for that right? You can control volume, though.
***If you're going to be docking / undocking your ipod a lot, I would not recommend this item. Especially if your ipod has a case. It takes a few tries to dock and people who aren't familiar with how to do it might just give up. That's when you take over and dock it. =)

..

6006840060008 I wanted a portable speaker system to carry on my boat that would allow me to listen to Pandora and other internet radio via my Blackberry. I am very happy with the quality of the unit and although the sound cannot compare to a Bose speaker, it performs very well.

..

6006840060008 I'm a dancer so I love being able to take my speakers anywhere I go if I need to practice, etc. And they're loud, too :)

..

6006840060008 Wish it played louder, sound is not as good as I expected.

..

6006840060008 Was truly amazed at sound quality . Listen to a lot of internet radio . i have a droid X which i use an auxiliary plug that u plug in the back . Wish it was on the side or on top side of the unit. the rechargable batteries last for about eight hours at reasonable volume levels.

..

6006840060008 This docking station is poor quality for the price. This is my second Logitech Ipod docking station I've had. The other one I had was terrific and lasted a couple years. It still would turn on and off, but no sound came out of the player. I purchased this docking station as I couldn't find the same one I had before and I liked it for the rechargeable battery feature. After two months it stopped working. Same deal....would turn on and off, but no sound comes out of the player. Unfortunately, I didn't save the warranty info. I won't purchase another Logitech player.

..

6006840060008 I bought this as a gift for my wife for her new MP3 player. Play back sounded as if an echo was coming out of the MP3 player. Listen through the ear plugs and great sound. I went through the MP3 player set up. No luck, still had the echo sound. Plus one track was louder then the other track. Voice track was low and in the back ground, where the backup singers and music where a lot louder and over ran the singer. For the price it's not worthe the money. May work a lot better if we owned a ipod? An ipod is out of our range price wise.

..

6006840060008 This unit is nearly perfect for its intended purpose. I originally got this to replace an ungainly collection of powered speakers and iPod chargers with what seemed like dozens of cables and plugs that kept getting tangled up. The Logitech unit has one single wire for the AC adapter, everything else is self-contained - very neat and orderly and nice-looking. The sound quality is amazingly good for such a compact unit. Sure, you can get better sound quality from a larger set of speakers, but this is the best sound I've heard from something this portable. As a bonus, since it is actually battery powered, you can just pick it up and carry it from room to room - and so I was able to get rid of all the extra sets of powered speakers throughout the house. The battery life seems quite long, certainly long enough for my purposes. The smooth rounded shape when closed makes it very easy to carry when traveling - no awkward corners to deal with. I've been using it with an iPod Touch, an 3rd gen Nano, and a 2nd gen original iPod - it works perfectly for charging and playing all of them. Works great with the iPod Touch as a Pandora receiver. The only change in this product that I would suggest is that it would be nice if it could share battery power with the iPod when not connected to the AC - right now my portability time is limited by the iPod touch draining relatively quickly when receiving Pandora via WiFi.

..

6006840060008 Is expensive and the sound is very bad, very different from what is said in the promotion article. I am very disappointed with the purchase.

..

6006840060008 
Play music on the go with this Logitech UE wireless speaker that features 2 full-range drivers that deliver pure and rich sound. A built-in microphone lets you make hands-free phone calls using a Bluetooth-enabled device.


..

6006840060008 I bought the Logitech UE Boombox for $129 + tax, loved the sound especially the bass but it's big and heavy. I didn't want to return it but I really dislike the size and the color as well as the battery life(4.5 hrs) at full blast. Also, I had an issue controlling the volume from my device(Nexus 5) . I was not able to raise or lower the volume from my phone. So I decided to try the Logitech UE Mobile Boombox. I paid $59 tax included, Officemax had it for 54.99 so BB matched their price. I was concerned my nexus 5 wouldn't pair properly but it did. I, also paired it to my Nexus 7 2013. Sound is clear and loud, although I missed the bass from the larger boombox. Battery life has not been measured but most reviews say it's about 8-10 hrs, which is more than enough for me. I hope my review helps you in your decision.

..

6006840060008 I have a Bose Sounlink II, and was looking for something smaller for packing and traveling. Picked this up and have no regrets. While the Bose is premier I was thoroughly impressed with the sound quality to price ratio. You will not be disappointed

..

6006840060008 The Logitech - UE Mobile Boombox is a very nice bluetooth speaker. Extremely easy to set up and sounds incredible. Very sturdy and looks great. Couldn't be happier with my purchase!

..

6006840060008 I bought this speaker for my g/f and it's awesome! The sound quality actually surprised me - don't get me wrong - it's not a Bose. It has a full rich sound out that comes from a very cool, small, easy-to-use speaker that is 1/3 of the price of a Bose. I'm very happy with my purchase, my g/f loves the speaker and I'm completely impressed with this product. Great job Logitech!!

..

6006840060008 I spent some time before making a choice reading reviews. I had made a lot of decisions in which speakers I was really interested. Turned on the ones I was picking from. The prices ranged from 79-250 dollars. This little unit stood proud and belted out the music. It was not the loudest, but it was the clearest! The surprising thing is it will fill a bedroom/bathroom with great sound. It also works perfect for a speakerphone in loud areas.
It is built well, looks great, deep sound and it comes with Logitech customer support behind it. Gotta say, I am looking forward to having it along with me this summer kayaking.

..

6006840060008 It is great! As small as it is, it has great sound -Its very loud! And also you dont need any cables to connect because it has bluetooth! Wow! Excellent!

..

6006840060008 Awesome product with great sound, easy set up, and long battery life

6006840060008 I never write reviews for anything, but I felt obligated to write one about the speaker. I was skeptical at first to purchase it because of how small the product was to be so costly. I was clearly wrong. I purchased the speaker already planning to take it back because I didn't think I would like it as much as I did. It was a great buy for me. As much as I listen to music this product really WOWed me. I fell in love as soon as I used it the same day. I haven't really timed the battery life, but it does last for quite some time. If you or anyone you know listen to music as frequently as I do, this is definitely an item to buy.

6006840060008 My mom has been hankering for some portable speakers for her new iPhone and Mac Book. I went to Best Buy planning to purchase the Jambox, but these actually sound better and get much louder. I was shocked! Great purchase - and still cute.

6006840060008 I got this wireless mouse because my original one stopped working. It fits my hand well, and it is easy to use. The original battery is still working (the packaging said it was good for 18 months), but since I use it a lot, I didn't think it would last as long as it has so far. I'm impressed! The sticker on the display was $20 higher than it actually was so that's a plus also (the wrong sticker was displayed).

6006840060008 I like the mouse and really enjoying to use it while I am at work. I never had any issues with this. I am planning to buy the same to my wife so that she never feel jealous of my mouse. ;)

..

6006840060008 Device is easy to use. I have used other Logitech mice before and this one is one of my favorite. It is very portable and connects with all devices I have tried so far without any install on the computer I am using. Really love this device.

..

6006840060008 The Logitech mouse is your standard mouse. I just like the Logitech devices. They work well.

..

6006840060008 I have bought several wireless mouse(s). This one is a little small, however I like that the battery life is longer because it goes into sleep mode when not in use.

..

6006840060008 Bought it for the laptop. Best price. Like the color. Easy to use.

..

6006840060008 Just plug it in and in about a minute you are using it. Love how it works on multiple surfaces.

..

6006840060008 The directions don't explain that you have to go into your computer system and adjust tones, the room the speakers are used in and volume to get the best sound although it's plug in and play. I ventured and found it for myself. I really loved them after that discovery.

..

6006840060008 I will be the first to admit that I am not an audiophile but I can't go a day without my music and when my Logitech Z313 speakers went out on me I searched for a replacement because I was happy with what I was getting out of them. Then I saw these on clearance for five dollars less than the Z313 speakers and thought I would give them a shot.

Setup of these speakers is easy. While I am not a fan of connections that are soldered into speakers and subwoofers, (the demise of my Z313 set was a direct result of not being able to swap out cables) the cables are heavy duty so that offsets that worry. While the cables themselves are short they are easily extendable. I would recommend getting a new line in cable as the one provided is a bit on the flimsy side but still functional. The option to wall mount your speakers is nice as well.

As far as sound quality is concerned these are great. You get great sound and bass right out of the box but if you know how to tweak an equalizer you can really milk these guys for quality sound. Add the fact that you can connect up to three other devices without unplugging anything else is awesome as well. Great for casual television viewing and gaming.

If these speakers were still 120.00 I would say pass until the price goes down as these speakers are only slightly better than the z313 model but what the z313 got wrong (unable to replace cables, volume dongle, only one line in) the z553 got right. At 45.00 you can't go wrong.

..

6006840060008 Decent price. Decent sound. I'd recommend for computer speakers.

..

6006840060008 I made my purchase as an impulse buy. I was surprised at how well its compatible with all my mobile devises and laptop.

..

6006840060008 Good sound for the price. I'm using them to augment the sound on a bedroom TV and they're excellent in that role. Certainly not something you'd use for a primary home theater setup, but for a computer or a secondary TV they are very solid.

..

6006840060008 First thing's first: My review for these speakers is very dependent upon the price I paid for them. I got these for $30 a piece (I bought two). My review still stands at the $52.99 pricetag that several online retailers are showing right now.

I love these speakers. These speakers are worth well over $50. I would say that the $99 price tag that I was seeing these at several weeks back might be a little high given the lack of THX certification found with some other Logitech speakers at that price point, but I would've been happy having paid $75 for these.

CONS:
- Aesthetics: Probably a turn-off for some, though I don't mind. What you see on the product page is what you're getting, but you are able to switch out the speakers for others with RCA inputs if you really hate the look and just need the sub/amp and maybe the control pod. Additionally, the cables are red. If I have exposed cables, I prefer that they be black. Both left and right speakers have red cables, as does the control pod. Even the included AUX cable is red. The only black cable is the power to the sub. I do like the red LED on the control pod, but mostly because it matches my case lights.
- Cable length: I could do with a few more feet of length on the speaker cables, but I managed. I suspect this length is pretty standard, I was just spoiled with my old 5.1 system that had 25 foot cables (though that system also had 40W per speaker and I was draining a fair amount of power just in cable length). You can always get standard RCA extensions, but you'll lose some volume capacity by doing so.
- Bass: Honestly, this system has all the bass I need, but I'm not an audiophile. I have an 8" sub in my car that's way more than I need, but this 4" sub does just fine for my needs. It is good enough that you'll be able to hear some (a small amount of) thump on your other floors, but don't expect the same kind of bass that makes your rearview mirror vibrate like mad or really upsets your neighbors. I end up leaving my bass control near 100% most of the time (gaming or listening to electronica). There is no independent input for the sub (like a center/sub jack you'll see with a 5.1 system).

PROS:
- Price! If you find these for the $30 I paid, jump on it! I'd still happily pay the $53 I've been seeing around.
- Sound quality: You can expect the quality of a $75-$150 set of PC speakers. I'm very happy with it. Sounds are clean and clear for the entire volume range. There is no disparity between the left and right speakers (as I've seen at least one other person mention) for either of the two sets I received.
- Build quality: I have no complaints on build quality. It feels solid and well-built. I worry a bit about the exposed speaker cones, but if you don't poke them hard they'll be fine, plus they look kind of neat. The speakers hold their angle very well when adjusted.
- Control pod: I adore this thing. It's has good rubber on the bottom to keep it from sliding and it's made to be heavy to hold itself in place. The entire top cylinder (visible in the product images) is the volume control and slides very smoothly and pleasantly. In the rear of the control are a headphone jack, an AUX input, and a bass control. The headphone jack (no duh) automatically disables sound to the speakers when used. The bass control (which I love, considering my old unit required me to crawl under my desk to adjust the bass) is a simple wheel that you can feel your way to without needing to look behind the unit. I lovethat there's an AUX input on the control pod because my spouse will often sit with her laptop nearby and want the better speakers without having to use my desktop. The AUX input can be left plugged in and does not disable any other inputs, they just overlap if you have more than one audio source. Finally, I really like that the control pod cable isn't integrated with one of the speaker cables (like many systems like this, particularly Logitech), which allows you to switch to any RCA-cabled speakers if you so choose.
- 3x Inputs: The system has three inputs, one AUX in the control pod (as mentioned previous), one AUX in the subwoofer, and one red/white RCA input in the subwoofer. I really like having several options so that I can have my computer in the AUX, a cable box in the RCA, and a phone for podcasts or a nearby computer in the control pod AUX. I've tested them all and they work as expected.
- Subwoofer design: I really like the vertical down-firing sub, though others may not. The casing is all plastic and the build quality is good. I like that I can fit it in a tight footprint, but it may not work for your setup. From the bottom of the rubber foot to the top of the sub, it's just under 15". If you include the diameter of the feet, you'll need just over 7" across for your footprint.
- Vertical angle adjustable: It's convenient and allows for wall-mounting, although you can't pass 90 horizontal (aim upward) if you chose to wall-mount. The angle holds well.
- Wall-mountable: It's nice that the system has this capability (thus it being listed as a "pro"), but if this is what you're buying for, it's not exactly going to be a simple procedure. There wasn't any sort of hardware or instructions included for wall-mounting, but the rubber feet are removable and provide a hole through which a screw or nail could pass, though I don't see you getting the flawless flush mount the product pictures show since you'll likely have the head of a screw exposed. I'd recommend only actually screwing in the top hole that's hidden by the speaker, then maybe leaving the other two holes empty or fashioning your own black plugs. (Note: I did not wall-mount my speakers)

In summary, these things are great! They aren't for you if you need a huge kick from your bass or you hate seeing the color red. There were enough negative reviews on some sites that I felt compelled to actually right a written review, so that's saying something considering I only provide written reviews when I feel strongly about a product (maybe once every year or two?).

..

6006840060008 Nicely packaged.
Fairly easy to set up. But did not have any sound from left speaker.

..

6006840060008 I bought these on clearance for $50. They're great speakers for $50 and are much better than the other logitec offerings at this price point, better than their $50 and $65 speakers. I wouldn't want to pay more for them... at $50 it's good sound for the value. More than that and value drops off sharply. For a bit more you can do inexpensive bookshelf speakers and a t-class amplifier for great sound at a low price, but these look real fun and take up less desk space than the bookshelf units. Anyway... so the first pair I got in there was a spot on the volume at around 50% that made the left channel fade out, pop and hiss. I had read about this in a review before so I wasn't really surprised. Disappointed but not surprised. I was happy enough with the build quality and sound from the speakers so I quickly returned them locally and had them send me another set. This second set sounds great and is without fault. I was skeptical of the little 4" woofer but it does really well. I've mine in the corner about 6" from either wall. I'm not going to say anything like "dazzling highs and hard hitting base" but I'll say they sound great, better than most computer speakers I've checked out. especially at $50. We'll see how long they last but if I get a couple of years out of them I'll be a happy camper. I'd say they're just right for a small living room or bedroom sized area for mp3 player sound or tv audio. They're perfect for your desk.

..

6006840060008 These speakers have no volume. They may be very smooth, but have nothing else. Beware of the RMS rating. It's not real.

..

6006840060008 just got this baby from best buy when its on a clearance sales for 80, works like a charm so far since.
the 40 watts subwoofer delivers nice packs of bass(though it wasnt really good, it can do better), average high and medium on each 10 watts speakers. love that it allows you to adjust the bass to your liking though it was placed at an awkward position, at the back of the volume control. love the design, solid black speakers and subwoofer with red cables definitely spice things up in the room. also love it cuz it allows you to connect to 3 devices simultaneously.
could be a bit pricey, tagged at 120 as the original price, other speakers at this price range could do better. but, got mine on the clearance sale for 70 which was a steal.
easy installation is also a plus, just plug-and-play.
rockin the house ever since!

Fastpack 150 Carrying Case (Backpack) for 13" Camera


..

6006840060008 Nice bag but after I got all my accessories it is no longer big enough so I had to go out and buy another bag - but I will use this bag for my previous camera

..

6006840060008 Overall a great small bag for you camera, although it may ba just a little too small.
A 13" MacBook Pro just fits inside, but only just.
By adjusting the dividing pieces inside I was able to fit my camera with a 18-200 zoom attached, a flash, and a 35 mm prime inside... But only just!
I wish Lowepro would make a Video Fastpack 200, as this (150) is slightly too small, but the 250 version is too big for my needs..

..

6006840060008

..

6006840060008 I have enjoyed this camera bag! It keeps me organized and has also been great during travel.

..

6006840060008 Well made bag carries my D300 Nikon (larger DSLR camera) with short zoom, long zoom, and separate flash attachment. Great padding for protection. Also extra compartments for stashing a lunch or light jacket. This is a comfortable backpack type bag. Interestingly, it also has a compartment fora laptop computer, so the bag works well for trips where I bring camera and computer on air travel. Highly recommend.
Downside is ease of access to camera. This is not a speedy, grab you camera and shoot type of bag. I own a different bag for those types of occasions.

..

6006840060008 Bought this bag few weeks ago and thought it will be great for an amateur camera enthusiast like me. I have 3 lenses and a speedlite all of them fits in this bag. I like that it opens from the back so I always feel secure. This bag is great if you like the outdoors.

..

6006840060008 This is a great product for the price, I absolutely love it.

6006840060008 I got this bag specifically for my travel overseas for hiking. The bag was a great fit for my camera and my extra lens, it was comfortable durable and practical!

..

6006840060008 I have 100-400mm and 70-200mm L series lenses and it was a very tight fit. Had to return this to get the flipside 300 instead. The bag is fine if you regular size lenses.

..

6006840060008 I've been looking for a camera bag for a while, but couldn't convince myself the typical looking camera man bag designs. This flipside 200 actually has a very cool design, and you open the backpack by unzipping in the inner side. The compartments inside are modular and very spacey. I'm currently carrying a t2i w/ battery grip w/ 2 batteries, 2 extra batteries, charger, 50mm 1.4, kit lens, lens cleaning brush, memory cards, flash, and a lot more. It will carry the medium to light tripods, and it's been highly constructed. It's got loops on the straps for pens, clip ons, pocket knife, etc. It also has two backpack straps for the chest and the waist. I'm in love with this bag!

6006840060008 Product was a gift for my daughter-in-law who has a new camera and wanted a way to carry her camera and accessories while hiking, etc. She liked the many compartments and that the zipper to access them was toward the back and not exposed to anyone behind her.

..

6006840060008 The Flipside is a much needed expansion from my small Mini Trekker. I would recommend Lowepro carefully demonstrate how access to the backpack should be taken with care on-the-fly. The contents, if not careful, could be dumped out without a little leg support from below. All is good though, plenty of needed space for equipment. I'm excited to put it to use!

..

6006840060008 This is my third Lowepro flipside bag. I started with the smallest in the 300 and then got two of the 400s and then finally this one. This bag can store 2 dslrs easily and at least 6-8 lenses. It will be great for long trips where I need this kind of setup. The chains on the bag are of excellent quality. The material of the bag is undestructable. I have always loved lowepro's quality and this bag did not disappoint. Got it at an unbeatable price. Great value thru Best Buy!

6006840060008 Since the Lowepro Flipside 10L Backpack was so new, I wasn't able to find much as far as reviews on the net before deciding to purchase it. But when Best Buy had a great deal on it, I couldn't resist. Especially for $50 less then the retail price. The only problem I had was that I wasn't able to check one out in person to help me decide if I wanted to get the 10L or 15L. And then of course, I couldn't decide on the colors available..... blue or orange. But, I decided to go with the Orange 10L because since I am a female, I wanted a backpack that wouldn't be too bulky for me. And the most important thing for me was that the shoulder straps were not too wide where it would bite into my arm. Since I couldn't actually check one out in person, I knew that I was taking a risk in purchasing it but I figured, what the heck.... for the price and since it's from Best Buy, I could always return it. Well, I am extremely glad that I got it. Not only is it super lightweight but it is overall, very comfortable. I was able to fit my Nikon d7000 w/ a 70-300mm, 50mm f/1.4, and SB-600 flash in the backpack with some room left to spare. Exactly what I needed the backpack for. The only thing that I wish that Lowepro had included was perhaps a bit of more organizer pockets. Other then that, I would highly recommend this backpack. This is perfect for me as I like to do a lot of street photography and a lot of walking. I have purchased numerous bags & backpacks in the last couple of months, only to continue my search for the perfect one. Thank you Best Buy & Lowepro for helping me find the "perfect" dslr backpack!

Carry your DSLR camera with grip and 300mm f/2.8 lens attached, plus a variety of photography accessories, with this Lowepro Flipside Sport 15L AW LP36424 backpack that features a built-in cover for optimal protection against the elements.


..

6006840060008 Thought about to buy a 10L AW instead, made a wise decision to choice the 15L AW, it has a bit more space for your gears. I can fit my 5d mk3 with 70-200 IS2 f/2.8, 24-70 f/2.8 II, 580EX2, and some filters comfortably. The backpack fits and looks extreme good. Love it.

..

6006840060008 Bought this site unseen as I wanted a better way to carry my Canon T4i, two lenses (including 75-300) speedlite flash, led for movies, filters, and extra battery charger and more!! Everything fits perfectly and the bag is super comfortable and light weight !! Highly recommend it!!

..

6006840060008 I have three other backpacks. This is the best one I have ever owned.
It upzips easily. It protects equipment very well since it opens from the back. I have back pain and shoulder pain and it doesn't bother me as much as my other backpacks.

..

..

6006840060008 I bought this bag because my camera case was just not cutting it anymore. I carry my Nikon D3000 with the 18-55mm lenses, a 75-300mm lenses, speed flash, GoPro HD2, mounts for GoPro, batteries, lense filters, charger for Nikon, SD cards, and my tripod when needed.

..

6006840060008 I would recommend this camera bag. it holds everything thing i needed, its durable and a good price.

..

6006840060008 There is a place for everything and all of the equipment is well protected. The bag is not bulky and the design allows for it to be carried as a back pack. This bag is being used by a serious photography student so it is important to have room for all of the lenses, cameras and extras she will be using. It also accommodates her tripod.

..

6006840060008 Received as a gift. It looks good and has plenty of storage features.

..

6006840060008 I bought this bag to house a Canon 60D with 18-135mm lens, 70-200mm lens, and 50mm lens...with room for either one more lens or flash in the future. The bag is made very durable, as can be felt from the weight alone. It is a relatively small backpack, sit rides kind of high on the back, which is good for hiking and walking around. Took it to Disneyland with my family of four. Carried the camera, lenses listed, four bottles of water, wife's wallet, and a half a gallon ziploc bag full of snacks. I thought it might be overkill as a camera bag for a dad with a camera, but it fit the bill perfectly.

..

6006840060008 I purchased this to hold my Digital SLR camera, lens and flash unit. Holds these securely and the bag provides ample padding. Compartments have infinite options with velcro adjustment. Sections to hold flash cards and cables. Quality of bag is good.

..

6006840060008 As usual Lowepro thought of most everything when designing this bag. I bought this for a trip to Hawaii to bring my multiple camera's, lenses as well as a video camera.
The size, versatility and protection of this bag was perfect, I would highly recommend checking it out before buying any other similar bag.

..

6006840060008 Can hold Canon 70-200 F/4 Lens with 50D Body and 2 extra lens, battery, charger, cables, filters,

..

6006840060008 This is a great bag for 1 camera and a couple of lens. Small enough so it is easy tho carry.

..

6006840060008 I like this camera case because it holds everything you need, additional lens, charger, USB cords etc...and is easily carried as a backpack. This allows you to shoot photos and change lens periodically.

..

Stow away or safely transport your compact system camera or DSLR camera with this Lowepro Passport Sling II LP36466 camera bag that features a nylon and polyester construction for protection against scratches and damage.


..

6006840060008 It is a good bag. But a few Velcro loops could make it a great bag. I want to carry a tripod along with my camera. This bag madness that difficult.

..

6006840060008 The bag looks like an ordinary bag which is really good since it does not shout a camera bag. However, the longer I use it the more discomfort on my shoulder. Another demerit point is the lack of cushion of the camera compartment.

..

6006840060008 Overall, the bag is the best I have seen - and I looked at quite a few, I would definitely recommend - and in fact, bought mine off of a friend's
recommendation.

..

6006840060008

Safeguard your camera and accessories in this Lowepro Transit Sling 250 AW LP36576 bag, which features dedicated pockets and an UltraFlex system for organized storage. A side zippered opening provides fast, easy camera access.


..

6006840060008 This camera bag is pretty good for traveling around my house. I just need to put all my stuff in one bag. If the designer can make backpack and sling together ( I can switch either way), that will be better. I right shoulder will feel pained by carrying sling bag for a long time.

..

6006840060008 I like the large screen compared to most MP3 players,
It takes some practice to use menus effectively.
My blue tooth connector didn't work well with it, the transmitter easily came unplugged.
I put it in a small case for protection and for carrying. That works well as long as none of the buttons are pushed.
4 gig size is adequate and it was easy to add a flash with a little manipulation to increase storage. Drag and drop between PC and player works well.

..

6006840060008 This was purchased for my 8 yr old daughter, playlists are difficult and the menus are not very user friendly. The touch screen sensitivity isn't that great either and the battery runs out quickly, like after an hr or so of use. Even in sleep mode the battery drains. For a cheap device for a child this is decent but for constant use and reliability I would opt for something better.

..

6006840060008 The mp3 player replaced a Coby that my grandchild had used and liked. I thought this player would be good for her because it had more features, a touch screen, a camera, plays video, etc. But the touchscreen doesn't work well and she gets frustrated trying to change apps and turn it on and off. It also doesn't have an FM radio which is too bad. I am not impressed with this player.

..

6006840060008 Good product, good price, and it is a nice addition to my music accessories.

..

6006840060008 It is a good starting mp3. It plays music and other things.

..

6006840060008 I like the fact i can put pictures, books movies and of course my music on it.

..

6006840060008 I loved it at first, but I don't think it lasted a month before breaking. If it had a metal case and a glass screen it would be a much better product.

..

6006840060008 got this to replace a current mp3 player for my car, and initially i was happy to have a new one. however due to the issues that I've had with the touchscreen i still find myself going back to my old mp3 player most of the time.

..

6006840060008 Can only get a little over 2.5gb of music onto a 4gb player

..

6006840060008 I bought this for my 10 year old. He loves listening to music and recording himself with the MP3 player.

..

..

6006840060008 it is easy to set up. it is good for a beginer like me. it has a good camera on it. it is awsome!

..

6006840060008 This mp3 is terrible. When i got it , it wouldnt turn on. Then when i let it charge some more and began to use it certain areas of the touchscreen (corners) didnt work. I even "calibrated" the touchscreen and it still didnt. Im not about to have sore thumbs because im jabbing them into my mp3 player.

..

6006840060008 I got this player for my birthday in hot pink. I love it. The menu is easy to understand and music is super easy to upload

..

Make up to 10 cups of freshly ground coffee from your favorite coffee beans with this Magic Chef coffeemaker that features automatic grind and brew for simplified use. The keep-warm function makes sure your coffee stays warm after it brews.


..

6006840060008 Went to go make my first pot of coffee in the new appliance, began pouring water into the reservoir. It stayed ... Like those road runner cartoons. But just as the cloud vanishes from under the coyote, so to did any visions of fresh coffee in my brain. The water poured out from everywhere - as if the seams of the entire machine were only connected by cheese cloth.

..

6006840060008 I got this machine to replace the coffee pot and grinder on my counter. It's a good price which was one of the key reasons I bought it. Programming the time to start the grind/brew is pretty straight forward, however the user manual could be more detailed as to what certain settings do or simply the process. The lights on the front of the machine are very bright, it's a night light in the kitchen, which is somewhat nice, but it is so bright that it actually makes it difficult to see the buttons and settings in certain situations. It is a pretty tall machine, so be sure to check the measurements before you buy. The grinder actually does a pretty good job of grinding evenly, however it is loud, partly because it is small. It's a small motor so it will be a little noisier. The problem with the grinder is that it simply runs too long. For the 1-4 cup setting it is set to run for 30 sec. and for a full pot it is set to run for 40 sec. This is way too long, after about 20 seconds, the beans are all ground and it's ready, this is when it gets loud, however I have figured out how to stop it and then set the program to run. When it is brewing it is actually pretty quiet and does a really good consistent job. My biggest frustration with this machine is the fact that you must clean the guts of it after every brew! Moisture builds up in the bean hopper and makes it muddy, there is a cover over the filter basket to help guide the grounds to the right spot this gets dirty. It is very annoying, so if you make more than one pot of coffee in the morning or even during the day this may not be your choice as it must be cleaned after every use. It even says to do this on the parts, so it's not just me. A couple of tricks I have done. I put beans in the hopper and "run" the cycle, stopping the grinder with the "off" button so I don't have to listen to it do nothing. I then push the "no grind" button and set the program timer. I have to do this, it is just to loud for too long in the morning, and I hate mornings enough.

Take advantage of the hobby-grade features of this Maisto 81132 remote-controlled Baja Beast off-road vehicle that propel you into some serious off-road racing action. The coil-over shocks and off-roading tires allow you to race on a variety of terrains.


..

6006840060008 I bought this for my son based on good reviews and reasonable price. It worked very well. My son loved it. The only downfall at first was that we couldn't buy a spare battery because of the unique battery connection. My son couldn't wait for the recharges he had so much fun. Then in the second week, it broke. when you try to make it go it just clicks. What a let down.

..

6006840060008 I bought this for my son for his birthday about a month ago. We go out and play with it a couple times a week. He really loves it :) Its very fast for a toy grade RC car and it looks very cool. I bought a 2nd battery online for it because the run time between charges is only 15min so that wasnt very good. After a few crashes my son managed to break off the silver plastic front bumper. I was able to use plastic epoxy to fix it though. The antenna straw that holds the antenna up on the car is very cheap and will break pretty quickly but thats not a big deal. I bought a replacement for $2 at a local hobby shop. Overall this RC car is very fun, looks great and is fast. Not a bad purchase. I find it to be better quality than alot of toy grade RC cars so this one is pretty decent.

..

6006840060008 Very responsive, setting the alignment from the remote is nice, drives great on pavement and hard dirt. Grass and soft dirt are not so great as the car is not heavy enough to get adequate weight on the tires, but that's true for most battery powered RC cars. Overall my 6 year old son has a good time using this car so I'm happy about that.

..

6006840060008 My son loves it, tought car. Easy to use, nice controller food range.

..

6006840060008 Great RC for my 5 year old and durable.My son loves it and plays with it often.

..

6006840060008 Tie rod mechanism is plastic and breaks easily. This is the third one in our extended family that has had one break.

Capture clear photos with this Manfrotto 293 MK293C4-D3Q2 tripod and 3-way photo head that offer stable support for most cameras up to 8.8 lbs. The lightweight, collapsible design lets you fold down portions of the tripod and head for easy transport.


..

6006840060008 The design of the head handles could be improved. Not completely user friendly. Ball head is much quicker to use and easy to operate.

..

This fish fryer features 1650 watts of power and accommodates up to 1 gal. of oil, so you can fry several servings of fish simultaneously. The folding lid with a built-in window allows you to monitor the cooking progress.


..

6006840060008 Can cook so much faster! Love this deep fryer! Will definitely recommend this product.

..

6006840060008 I should have bought it a lot sooner and not waited so long.

..

6006840060008 
Instantly stream music, movie soundtracks, audio books, game audio, and more from your tablet or smartphone, all with far better sound quality than the tiny speakers built into your device.


..

6006840060008 Surprisingly good sound for a small speaker, simple function and great value

..

6006840060008 
Take your tunes with you on the go with this Memorex MW550 wireless speaker that features Bluetooth technology to allow easy pairing with a Bluetooth-enabled device. The built-in microphone enables hands-free phone calls.


..

6006840060008 This is a great product that I use when I travel for business when I don't want to listen to music on headphones while in my hotel room. Fits into my suitcase nicely, excellent sound quality at low levels (important in hotel rooms!) and very easy to pair with my iPhone 4.

..

6006840060008 Bought two of these, one for my office and one for my home woodshop. Set up with the IPhone was easy and both worked on the first try. Sound is good, but dont expect audiophile performance. Great choice for a casual listener or for background music or talk.

..

6006840060008 This is a NICE (small bluetooth) speaker that has excellent range. The strength is very good as it goes through walls and other obstructions. Also VERY easy to use as my Toshiba laptop quickly found it and synced with it. Highly recommended for the size, price, and sound quality.

..

6006840060008 This is a great speaker! I love using the bluetooth connection from my iPhone and listening to my music. It has an automatic shut off feature if you don't use it for a while, which is nice. Great sound too!

..

6006840060008 Love this speaker. Received it as a gift to use with my iTouch in my office. Love the blue tooth WiFi feature. Small speaker, great sound would also work for home or in a dorm room.

..

6006840060008 Easy to pair. Sounds great. Works with both my Samsung tablet and my Motorola Droid. Wish I had one for every room!

..

6006840060008 I bought one on sale for work and liked it so much went and bought another one for the house. Works great with my Samsung phone and sounds really good for the money. Kinda agree on if not on sale I wouldn't have bought. Would have spent a little more to get a Logitech.

..

6006840060008 I got the speaker on sale otherwise probably would not spend that much money on one. Love the size- about the same as a hardcover novel. I've never used bluetooth before- the directions were not very clear on how to get things connected but managed to figure it out.

..

6006840060008 
Capture important moments on the go with this MetroPCS LG Optimus L9 610214632647-R cell phone that features a 5.0MP digital camera, so you can shoot crisp images and 1080p videos. Wi-Fi connectivity lets you surf the Web.


..

6006840060008 Got on CLOSEOUT for a teenage. Only $79 NO contract. Activated on Metro PC and works great!
NEW version (L90) has 4.7 and larger battery for just $179

..

6006840060008 Good picture quality on rear camera, but terrible for front facing camera. Phone too big for my taste. The battery gets hot with barely any use. My biggest issue is the low internal memory capacity. I'm always getting the "can't update/download/ etc...no storage space." There is no option to transfer applications to the sd card to make room on the phone. Good value for the money though.

..

6006840060008 Really love this phone very user friendly, bought one for my fiance she loves it as well just a overall great phone .

..

6006840060008 This phone has a great display and has many features.

..

6006840060008 This phone is much bigger than my other LG Motion, which I had before, and it's also way lighter. The screen is big enough for games but its pretty much useless because if you're the type that likes apps, good luck downloading them. A lot of times i find myself having to delete a ton of stuff so i can just download an app, or take a video.

..

6006840060008 I got this phone for my son and he loves it! Great for him to listen to music and play games on.

..

6006840060008 this phone has the ability for a 32 gig storage card well your apps that usually do save to sd cards DO NOT SAVE HERE

..

6006840060008 Why pay more when this phone does it all it's a great phone at a great price why pay more when this phone does it all like other expensive phone's be smart and get this phone

..

6006840060008 I enjoy using this phone. It has been very easy for me to use ut and im able to do it myself but more storage space would be nice and a better battery life would be much better.

..

6006840060008 This was a great alternative for my wife. Great price, love the Android OS, and works really well. We've had some minor call issue (delays, bad signals), but nothing really major.

Touch Cover for Surface


..

6006840060008 Microsoft did a wonderful job. Works great and keys are extremely responsive.

..

6006840060008 Works great. Easy to use and helps protect my Surface.

..

6006840060008 This product is great but some keys need a little bit more than a tap. Maybe after a while I will develop the muscle memory for the touchcover. Other then that it works well.

..

6006840060008 Slim,lightweight,and works exactly like it should. Cool shade of red that looks good when put together with the black tablet.

..

6006840060008 The touch cover is working quite well most of the time. But I had 2 instances in this first month where the keys stopped responding. I had to detach and reattach the cover to start working again. It seems fairly rugged but I am a little concerned that the very thin outer edges may become easily frayed after much use. Time will tell.

..

6006840060008 Works like a traditional push key keyboards in that I could rest my fingers on the board and type by applying pressure. Might need a little getting used to due to feel, But I got used to it really quickly.

..

6006840060008 I got this keyboard for my Windows RT tablet, I bought it separately because I didn't want just the standard black. It is a very good keyboard, better then keyboards I have used for other tablets. It does take a little bit to get used to the touch buttons, but other then that it is great!

..

6006840060008 Well it's light and cool looking, but I personally like to have a keyboard that you actually depress the keys. Traded this back in to get the more expensive snap in keyboard. It just works better I think for someone that likes to actually feel the keyboard. I may just be old fashion.

..

6006840060008 I got scared after I bought this and then saw the reviews online, however this keyboard is fantastic. It snaps on so easily. You get audio feedback when you type which lets you know the key was pressed. I am a fast typist and got used to typing on this very quickly. It makes the whole surface experience. I use it to type notes during meetings and it is brilliant.

..

6006840060008 I definitely recommend buying a touch cover with your Surface RT (or Pro), it turns the surface into a fully functional and totally portable laptop with the super responsive touchpad doubling as a screen protector when not in use. It is durable yet slim and very easy to attach (and stays attached!). Since it is a flat surface with no "give" to the keys, expert typists may need a few hours to adjust to the new feel in order to get full use of the keyboard as they would with a traditional button based keyboard. I find it getting dusty quickly but it cleans easy with a damp towel. After getting it my only regret is not getting the blue one... the red just isn't the color I wanted it to be. Other than that it is perfect :)

Take your music to the next level with this Avid Pro Tools 10 software upgrade that features Clip Gain for quick editing and mixing in multiple audio formats for versatile use. Loop recording lets you combine multiple takes for an optimal recording.


..

6006840060008 The upgrade from express to the full version of Pro Tools 10 has been my best software purchase of the year.
For those who are new to the program, there is a learning curve, but any effort will yield you benefits that are worth your time.

Enjoy high-definition entertainment with this Monster 1000HD Ultimate High Speed 6.6' HDMI cable that features 17.8 Gbps bandwidth to support images up to 4K x 2K resolution and 7.1 lossless surround sound.


..

6006840060008 This cable gives me a great picture. I have a 3d tv and there really is a difference between higher quality and even a mid range cable

..

6006840060008 I always love Monster products and the quality is very good. This cord is still a little high, but will come down with time.

..

6006840060008 When I checked out to purchase my Smart TV, it was recommended that I purchase this expensive cable by necessity for viewing the special features of the TV. My research after the purchase revealed that for the average user, this cable is unnecessary as the average user/viewer wouldn't be able to "capture" the benefit. I'm sure it's a great product for the right user, but not the casual.

..

6006840060008 I bought 2 of these cables, and they are the Monster Advanced which it is written on cable Advanced, not the Monster Ultimate as advertised. The cable they sent was, black with red dot, it is not the Monster Ultimate that is gray with gold dot as pictured, can't get them to respond to email, not even Best Buy can get them to respond, I'm out my purchase price stuck with inferior cables, do not use this company, they are a nightmare.

Enjoy high-definition entertainment with this Monster 1250HD Ultimate High Speed 140647-00 5' HDMI cable that features 17.8 Gbps speed for fast signal transfer. The HDMI performance indicators show you the signal resolution at a glance.


..

6006840060008 top quality hdmi cable, easy installation, purchased on sale at a good price

..

6006840060008 Works just as good as the more expensive ones, I don't think there's any need to pay more. I know the Specs say otherwise but the proof is in the pudding my friend decided to go the higher route and I got this one and we have the EXACT same TV and played the EXACT same game and it looked EXACTLY the same, I also purchased one for my Cable connection and the Image was flawless, great price and image.

..

6006840060008 The Monster 1250 is a good hdmi cable, but has contruction similar to a lower price cable. Twisted cooper wires and sodered connectors. The gimmick of this cable, is that a little light will come on to show that a 1080, 4K or 480 signal is going through. LOL

Enjoy high-quality sound with this Monster Clarity HD 133257-00 Bluetooth speaker that features AAC and apt-X support for easy pairing with your mobile phone or laptop. The built-in microphone enables speakerphone capability for conference calls.


..

6006840060008 I love this speaker. I had a Bose systemlink in my hand but thought it was to big for the place I had to put it on my motorcycle. So the sales specialist at Best Buy gave me some options. The monster clarity HD was one of these. I was concerned about the sound quality, so she set up a Bose on one side of the store and we listened to it, then she set up the Monster on the other side of the store and if I didn't know which was which I would never been able to tell the difference! My only disappointment is that the volume does not go high enough to hear on my motorcycle at highway speeds.
Other than that I highly recommend this unit.

..

6006840060008 I travel a lot for work, so this speaker has been AMAZING for me. I love the sound quality on my conference calls, and I even use it in the car for GPS and hands free calling.
I love that I can switch between my calls and music with just a touch of a button.
Music sounds great over it too, especially considering how small the speaker is. I wasn't too sure about it when I first played with it in the store, but when you aren't in a cavernous space, the speaker really fills the room well.
FANTASTIC!!!!

..

6006840060008 Ive tried the Jambox and the Bose portable But the Monster Micro was the best over all!! Back in the days Monster was known for the wires but now the gave us a portable speaker. Its great to conference calls and awesome hooked up to my iPad. I recommend all apple users to transfer your iTunes song to a AAC file and listen to how clear and strong the sound is over Bluetooth in AAC. Monster has done it again. Not sure why theres so much negitvity on here maybe everyone isnt using it correctly.
FYI - in case you need to reset the unit turn it off and the put a paper clip in the reset hole and hold it and turn the unit back on ..... simple!

..

6006840060008 I figured I would try the product due to it's compact size and being a product from Monster. The price point was very high for the disappointing quality. It constaly losses connection with my iPad 3. Resets were very troublesome. I returned it for the Bose Soundlink, Bose has it all on this device.

..

6006840060008 you cant play the music while its charging and you have always to reset it to function again ..and always disconnected from bluetooh ..jambox is much better than this one honestly ..and the durability is not good bec the grille is only magnetic if you accidentally drop it im sure it will be broken ..the sound quality is good but lack of bass ...the design i would say its good also bec of the strap and the price its not woth it 100 $ is alright of this product ..but i will not recommend this ..i hope it will for you guys ...

..

6006840060008 I bought this with the intention of using it on a day to day basis and that is exactly what I do. It works excellently in my condo and the voice activated features work extremely well! My favorite part of this unit though is the battery life! I can typically charge this the night before and take it out with me all day and never have to worry about charging it throughout the day. It sounds great for what you get and I certainly think it is much better than the jambox. Totally pick this thing up! It's awesome!

..

6006840060008 So, I purchased this NEW version of the Monster Micro HD from a Best Buy in Nasuha. I honestly think that they had the only unit on the east coast. "Cassie" at Best Buy was terrifically helpful (Good luck on your film-making degree).
There was no way to demo the unit in the store, so I bought it along with a Big Jambox for comparison. I tested this unit first when I got home and was immediately surprised by the tinny sound. It was as if the treble was set too high on the unit. Tried many genres of music and heard the same thing. So then I tried the Big Jambox. Oh my goodness!
Of course, it is in a completely different class of speaker than the Micro HD, so I know that it is unfair to compare, but c'mon kids. The extra $100 is well worth it! If you are already spending $200, why not an extra $100 to get something that is SUBSTANTIALLY better sounding. True, the Big Jambox is big compared to the Micro HD, but it is still portable. Consider what we all mean by portable here. Portable means that you can take it with you and it doesn't require two people to carry it. If you want tiny so that it fits in your pocket, then you should simply get a y-splitter and a second set of headphones if you want to share your music with others.
To my mind, the micro HD and its related brethren fall into a zone that cannot be covered with a mini speaker. They are not loud enough to fill a room with quality sound and yet they are not small enough to be better than a good set of headphones. It reminds me of the era of the crossover bicycle from the 90s. If you can afford to have a road bike and a mountain bike, then they are a MUCH better option than a crossover bicycle which is so-so on the road and lousy off road. If you are already investing $200 in a speaker, then money is probably not a real issue. So, get the Big Jambox. That extra $100 spread out over the 5 years you will be using this unit is 5 cents per day!
So, the Micro HD is a nice try, but still falls far short of the big guns: The Big Jambox and The Bose Soundlink.

Monster Cable iCarCharger AI 1000 Auto Adapter


..

6006840060008 I did check the reviews out before purchasing, but thought overall the product would be good for the drive to and from work. This item did work all done for one day only. After the second day it caused the iPhone 4 and 3Gs to reset themselves. I tried another outlet and also another car thinking it might be something to do with that. No luck. Unless this item is fixed by the manufacturer that I will be not use and cut my losses.

..

6006840060008 Horrible distortion with the use of an iPhone 4. I would test on other earlier models, but I don't feel like beta testing what should never have made out to production.

..

6006840060008 The charger works great with my iPhone 3GS, but not with my boyfriend's iPhone 4, which is why I bought it. It will charge for about 10 minutes or so, then say it's not compatible with the device. Not sure if it's a software problem or what, but does not work well with iPhone 4.

..

6006840060008 Tried 2 different units on multiple IPod/IPhones, after the unit is charging/working for a few minutes it just diconnects while still plugged in. The power light starts flashing slightly. SOmething internally like heat related.

..

6006840060008 I bought this product after absolutely loving the amazing sound quality of the Monster iCable. I figured with this product I could eliminate another cable, have the same outstanding sound quality, and have controls for my ipod at my finger tips. I could not have been more wrong. When plugging the audio cable into the aux port of my car stereo, I was shocked at the awful sound quality coming thru the speakes. I promptly returned this product(hoping that I had just gotten a defective one)but no luck. The second iCarCharger 1000's sound quality was just as distorted, and brash as the first. I returned the iCarCharger 1000 again, and went back to using my iCable with a seperate iPod car charger. All of my numerous other Monster products have always lived up to my expectations(if not exceeded them)but this product is a straight up disappointment :(

..

6006840060008 Definetly not worth the price, let alone even $20. Dont recommend this what so ever.

..

6006840060008 Add me to the list of people disappointed in the sound quality of this charger. I use my iPhone 3GS in my car for music, connecting it to my car's audio system using the AUX jack (and prior to the 3GS, used my original iPhone). I'm still using the old Belkin Auto Charger for iPod with Dock Connector which has EXCELLENT audio (no distortion whatsoever, no scratchy sound). The Belkin charger worked fine with my original iPhone, but won't charge my current 3GS. For months now I have been trying to find a replacement for the Belkin charger that will still have excellent audio, but will also charge my 3GS. So far, nothing has worked out, because the audio is always terrible.
Prior to the recent purchase of the Monster iCarCharger, I read numerous negative reviews of this product, but decided to try it anyway. The sound is fine until a loud passage in the music, and then the music is greatly distorted. Prior to the Monster iCarCharger, I also tried the Kensington LiquidAUX for iPhone/iPod, and that was even worse. The Monster iCarCharger will be going back, same as the Kensington did.
Sadly, there is not a single one of these type of products made currently (i.e., with 1 cable going to the dock connector to handle charging & audio) that has excellent audio, therefore I'll have to continue using the Belkin until someone figures out a better product. I just wish the Belkin would charge my 3GS, then I'd be in heaven.

..

6006840060008 Overview: This is a great charger that allows cars with the audio aux. plug to get very good audio pumped directly to the cars stereo system.
Pros: Convenient and easy to use, great audio quality, and charges the iPod fairly quickly
Cons: Does offer a cable management system for the audio cable jack but does not offer the same for the iPod adapter jack.
Overall, a great product that I would highly recommend if you like charging your iPod while listening to great quality music playback.

..

6006840060008 I have an iPhone 3GS with an aux jack and charger plug in my center console. I tried several options to charge my iPhone and listen to it at the same time. Most required 2 cables, one aux jack and one charging. With most of the devices I tried, I got great sound with the aux jack ONLY, but distortion/interference when I connected a charger at the same time.
After trying a couple of different options, I stumbled on this at Best Buy. I hooked it up in the parking lot, and Voila'!! - distortion gone and problem solved. Great solution!!

Featuring 24K gold contacts, this 4' HDMI cable ensures improved signal strength between HDMI components.


..

6006840060008 Unlike the guy below cables do make a difference. Cheap and in adequate cables will cause signal loss,easily detach from your source and especially in 3d you will not see the depth thats intented for you to see most bestbuys have that demo to show the differnce. Its funny how they say cables dont make the difference when the inside of cheaper cables have almost no protecting shielding very small gauge as well which allows minimal signal transfer. PLUS CABLE FOR LIFE are you serious you cant go wrong. If technology goes beyond monster will replace your cable FOR FREE !!!!

..

6006840060008 I can't believe how many people are claiming these cables actually make a difference. Do not believe them! A digital signal is a digital signal - as long as you have an HDMI v1.3 cable, it will do the same thing as this expensive one.
Sure, it's easy for me to say don't believe them, but do believe me. Since I can't post a link, do a quick Google search and look for professional reviews (not forums with average consumers) on sites such as CNET or Gizmodo. Then, be happy you saved $145 while getting the same picture and audio quality from your new HDMI cable.

..

6006840060008 I reviewed many websites bashing upscale cables as a waste of money. Those who seek top performance out of their systems could be easy prey to unsubstantiated claims. However the proof is in the pudding. I bought the monster cable for my Pioneer BDP09FD connected to a 65" Panasonic. This was after I had already had it hooked up with a lesser value but quality cable (not quite a "coat hanger" as some bashers claim produce the same results as a high end cable).
My son who was quite skeptical immediately noticed the difference. Even though the picture before was impressive, it was now stunning. My whole family could see an improvement. There is a difference; do not believe the reverse hype. The cables are extremely pricey but they deliver, at least on quality systems.
Finally I am not a "shill" for anyone. I am a consumer like you. I also do not like to waste money. But I believe what my eyes and other's eyes see. Remember you can always take it back.

..

6006840060008 the hdmi cable m series is better than any wire i have ever tried.its performance is fantastic.

..

6006840060008 If you consult with any of the Blu-ray manufacturers (Panasonic, Sony, Samsung, etc.) they will tell you there will be no difference in the picture quality between an inexpensive HDMI cable and the $100+ Monster cables. Read this and educate yourself...

6006840060008 In AUDIO / VIDEO, even a small percentage of discernable difference is worthy of consideration especially when it affects the sound. HDMI is responsible for everything now, sound and video, so it is a very important consideration if using in a worthy system. Long story short, I have been using a $100 HDMI cable from Audioquest who I love, on my Pioneer 05 Bluray. I already had a M1000 HDMI connected to my HDDVD player and for the longest time, it out-shined my Bluray player. I decided to switch the two cables and I don't have the hyperboles to describe the difference, none of which were subtle mind you. Again this was comparing a plus $100 HDMI, not a cheap one.
Findings as follows on 133" Theater Room.
Color: dramatically more saturated.
Detail: Another gear, like having eye surgery.
Motion: I accepted the judder as part of the whole experience (133" screen). Judder is gone! Speed is lightning. Threw in Spider man 3 on all scenes that gave me fits before. NONE now. Same with Cloverfield with all the camera motion. Twister same deal.
Black detail:(Hallmark of any good picture)Sensational. Blacks are not only darker, but detail in dark scenes are unbelievably good now. Always had issues in this department with all other HDMI's used. Not with this one. Dark Knight, is a new movie.
And sound, well being more important then the picture, the sound is just as impressive as the picture. I am using the internal decoding in player (Wolfson Chips) and everything, Bass, Highs, Imaging, DYNAMICS, imerssion and detail have another level.
This cable is under-priced, I would pay a lot more if I knew I would be getting this kind of maximum return.
Especially if your system is worthy and your screen is larger than 50" pay the price and reward yourself and your system.

..

6006840060008 OK. I WAS EXTREMELY SKEPTICAL THAT THIS CABLE WOULD TRULY MAKE BOTH A PICTURE AND AUDIO IMPROVEMENT ON MY SIMPLE SET-UP AT MY OFFICE. ALL I HAVE IS A 6 MONTH OLD VIZIO VP504, 1080P, 50" PLASMA WITH DIRECT TV HR-21 DVR AND A BRAND NEW SONY BDP-S360 BLU-RAY PLAYER. NO SPEAKERS, NO RECEIVERS. JUST THE 3 ITEMS ALONG WITH A BLU-TOOTH WIRELESS HEADPHONE AND ADAPTER THAT I USE JUST ABOUT 100% OF THE TIME AS I'M ALWAYS WALKING AROUND MY OFFICE AND I HAVE TO USE HEADPHONES. WHICH BY THE WAY SOUND INCREDIBLE AND WORK OVER 300 FEET AWAY IN EVERY ROOM OF MU BUSINESS. ANYWAY,WHEN I INSTALLED THE THREE ITEMS, I USED THE CHEAPEE HDMI CABLES THAT CAME WITH THE VIZIO PLASMA AND BLU-RAY. THE 2 HDMI CABLES WERE BOTH LOW END, BUT WERE MADE BY DIFFERENT MANUFACTURER'S. WHEN WATCHING DIRECT TV HD PROGRAMS, ESPECIALLY YANKEES ON YES OR GOLF, PICTURE LOOKED AWESOME. I WAS EXPECTING AND TOLD THE BLU-RAY DVD'S WOULD LOOK EVEN BETTER. HOWEVER TO MY SURPRISE, AS WELL AS ALL MY FRIENDS, THE BLU-RAY DVD'S DID NOT LOOK BETTER. IN FACT, THEY WERE QUITE WORSE. I MESSED AROUND WITH ALL THE SETTINGS, HAD MY AUDIO GUY COME IN AND HE AGREED THE BLU-RAY PICTURE SHOULD LOOK MUCH BETTER AND SHOULD BE BETTER THAN THE DIRECT TV PICTURE AS I HAVE A 1080P PLASMA USING 1080P BLU-RAY DVD'S VS MOST DIRECT TV 780P-1080I PROGRAMMING. HE IMMEDIATLY TOLD ME TO RUN OVER AND BUY 2 GOOD QUALITY MONSTER CABLES. I ARGUED WITH HIM AFTER READING THESE FORUMS AND HOW MANY GUYS STATE THESE "DIGITAL" SIGNALS VS THE OLDER "ANALOG" SIGNALS DON'T NEED OR BENEFIT FROM HIGH END HDMI CABLES AND THAT A $10.00 HDMI WOULD GIVE ME THE SAME PICTURE/AUDIO QUALITY. I REALLY COULDN'T SEE WASTING MONEY ON HIGH END CABLES AS THIS ISN'T IN MY HOME AND IT'S NOT A HIGH END PIONEER PLASMA. I REALLY DIDN'T THINK THESE WOULD MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE AND I REALLY DIDN'T LOOK FORWARD TO SPENDING 25% OF THE COST OF MY PLASMA ON 2 LOUSY CABLES. SO I DECIDED TO TRY SOMETHING 1ST. THE ONLY THING I DID WAS SWAP THE 2 HDMI CABLES FROM THERE INPUTS, SO THE DIRECT TV INPUT WOULD NOW USE THE BLU-RAY PLAYER HDMI CABLE AND VISE VERSA. ABSOLUTLEY NO OTHER CHANGES. WHEN I TURNED THE 3 ITEMS BACK ON TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANY DIFFERENCE (AND I REALLY WASN'T EXPECTING ANY) I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. NOW THE BLU-RAY PLAYER LOOKED ALOT BETTER--NOT FANTASTIC--BUT OBVIOUSLY TO EVERYONE BETTER--AND NOW THE DIRECT TV PICTURE LOOKED WORSE. SO I SUMISED THAT THERE REALLY WAS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EVEN THESE LOW END HDMI CABLES. THIS GAVE ME ENOUGH CONFIDENCE TO GO OVER AND PLUNK DOWN THE $135.00 PER CABLE AND IF I DIDN'T SEE A NOTICABLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PICTURE WITH THE NEW MONSTER VS THE BETTER HDMI CABLE I HAD, I WOULD RETURN IT AND BUY ANOTHER LOWER PRICED, BUT NOT GARBAGE HDMI CABLE. WELL INSTALLED THIS MONSTER CABLE AND I TURNED THE 3 ITEMS ON TO SEE. THE IMPROVEMENT WAS EXTROIDINARY ALL AROUND. BOTH THE PICTURE QUALITY AS WELL AS AUDIO THRU MY HEADPHONES WAS UNBELIEVABLY BETTER, ESPECIALLY WITH THE BLU-RAY CONNECTION. MY MUSIC (FLEETWOOD MAC, RUSH, ETC..) BLU-RAY DVD'S ARE INCREDIBLE. I REALIZE THIS IS AN EXTREMLY LONG POST, BUT I JUST HAD TO INCLUDE ALL THE DETAILS. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO THINK A $15.00 HDMI CABLE WILL WORK EVERY BIT AS GOOD AS A HIGH QUALITY HDMI CABLE--TRUST ME--THEY WON'T. PLEASE DON'T THINK I'M SAYING YOU NEED TO BUY THIS TOP OF THE LINE $150.00 CABLE. I'M SURE A VERY GOOD $50.00-TO PERHAPS $75.00 CABLE WOULD WORK JUST AS WELL. BUT BELIEVE ME, STAY AWAY FROM THOSE VERY CHEAP HDMI'S. I CANNOT BELIEVE THE PICTURE I'M GETTING NOW ON THIS VIZIO PLASMA. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND SPEND THE EXTRA $$ ON THE HDMI CABLE EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE A HIGH END PLASMA. IT TRULY MAKES AN INCREDABLE DIFFERENCE. I KNOW IT'S NOT ALONG THE LINES OF A PIONEER, BUT FOR MY NEEDS, I'M SO STOKED!!!! THIS IS THE PLASMA PICTURE I WAS HOPING TO GET FROM THIS VIZIO AND WITH THE NEW CABLES, IT'S EXCEEDING MY EXPECTATIONS. HOPE THIS HELPS SOMEONE LIKE MYSELF WHO COULDN'T SEE UPGRADING CABLES!!!!!

..

6006840060008 I had my reservations about sinking $170 into a cable. What is the difference between the high end offering by other brands that run around $80 or so and this cable which is twice as much? Well, let me tell you that this cable does what it says. If you own an LCD with the 120MHz motion processor and Directv HD than this is a MUST HAVE. There is noticeable difference in picture response, no blur, pixilation or distortion Improved sharpness and sound. Most noticeable is the depth of color. My wife even noticed this (not an A/V geek like me) and said that the picture looks more life like and the kids cartoons (the CG ones not the Hanna Barberra we grew up with) looked 3D. Over all I am VERY happy. I will be replacing the Sony Blu-Ray cable next to take full advantage of all this great product has to offer.

..

6006840060008 I just got a relatively new 40" Samsung LCD today and got this cable to go along with my 360 and upconvert DVD player (this will get replaced by a PS3 eventually). After watching Transformers and playing Call of Duty 4 and NHL 08 I either ended up with a TV that is better than my parents which I doubt since they have a Pioneer Elite 50" 1080p plasma or my cables are just that much better than their Monster 800 series cables. Not really sure on that one, but the cables aren't hurting it one bit. If your going to invest a large sum of money into a new home theater spend the extra money and get the best stuff from the start otherwise you might regret it later.

..

6006840060008 This HDMI cable brings out the quality and potential that my Samsung LN-T4081F has to offer. I use it with my Blu Ray player and it looks amazing. Planning on getting more of this same cable for my DirecTV and Xbox 360.

Monster Cable XPHP-CI BIG-100 XPHP Advanced Speaker Cable (Bare wire) - 100ft - Clear


..

6006840060008 I've gone through three home theater systems. My first when I was in the 8th grade was a Home Theater in a Box (HTIB) and was a Panasonic. At that time I was thrilled because most grown-ups didn't have what I had. I lived with that system for four years before problems starting occuring, which is when I bought some "Magnolia grade speakers" Mirage. Then I upgraded my speaker wire from regular monster speaker wire (white) to CL3 rated but just the High Performance. Call me crazy, but after one year I completely upgraded my entire system with all new speakers and I upgraded the speaker wire as well. I wanted the best (from Best Buy) and I got it. I got a pair of Definitive Mythos STS, mythos ten center channel, mythos xl gems for surrounds, mythos two's for rears, and a Martin Logan Dynamo subwoofer. After three times of changing speaker wire, I decided to run a little test. To my surprise I could hear a difference between my original wire and my new speaker wire. The difference was about the same as 60hz to 120hz. So it was notable, but wasn't bad. Then I tried High Performance vs "Ultra" High Performance. Ultra High is thicker and I expected a better signal because of it. Didn't notice a difference with my tower speakers or center, but my rears and surround had a LITTLE more umph to them (more depth in the midrange). This is high quality speaker wire, but for the sound difference and extra $70 I don't know if it is worth it. It all depends on what you are running, I recommend this for people like me who look for the best their money can buy but for most people they won't notice much of a difference.

..

6006840060008 At 169.99 for 100 Fett yeah it's kind of expensive especially if your running a 7.1 or 9.1 surround. But then again if your running that type of sytem you've GOT the DOUGH and for the BEST stuff that you buy it's ONLY natural that you would want the BEST speaker wire, right.
Well you've found it. And C'Mon for LESS than $200.00 to hook up the most important item, your speakers, IT IS worth it!

..

6006840060008 This speaker wire is a high quality design and produces very clear sound. This my first home theater so I have not had the pleasure of listening to multiple brands of cables. In that light though, I have mostly monster cables connecting all my devices and the system performs very well. I'm very pleased with the results it produces. I would recommend this cable to anyone who is willing to pay for it.

This modem features wireless-N networking with 25 Mbps speed for fast data transfer. WEP, WPA and WPA2, along with an enhanced firewall, help keep your data secure.


..

6006840060008 Bought this after having trouble with my 5 year old Moto 2210 model finally gave out. Being as I had such good luck with the old Moto I wanted to stay with them and would be nice eliminating a stand alone wireless router as well. Nothing but continuous dropped sync for two days and finally gave up and returned the piece of junk for a cheaper Netgear 150 (which I'm not totally happy with due to a bit slower wifi speed between computers and game consoles for media streaming but it does work and maintains a strong maximum speed connection with no sync problems).
You will need to manually set your VPI & VCI for this thing to function correctly if you have AT&T standard DSL so if you are gonna fight it out then remember this. Hated to jump ship but reliability is king.

..

6006840060008 Works fine as a DSL modem in bridge mode. The router and wireless functionality is quite uneven. One the one hand, it allows for creation of multiple WiFi networks. On the other hand, the port forwarding functionality is somewhat limited, doesn't appear to have full DMZ functionality, and I couldn't get the router to pass an incoming PPTP VPN connection to a server. Also lacks a DynDNS updater client.
Needs new firmware to be anything but a mediocre consumer-grade device.

..

6006840060008 I configured the device as instructed by the installation process and my ISP. The device will not maintain an internet connection. The DSL connection stays lit/connected but the internet connection drops for no apparent reason. Best Buy's support advice was to restart the device. That's equivalent to no support. Motorola has no support unless you have a corporate account. Your ISP will only spend a limited amount of time (if any) on a device they didn't supply. If you buy this device and have a problem don't waste your time, return it and get a different brand. I gave one star because zero wasn't an option.

..

6006840060008 I bought this modem when my NetZero modem failed. The installation was very easy-- thanks to the user-friendly CD Installation Guide. I had my internet connection up and running right away and my wireless devices synced quickly. Thank you Motorola!

6006840060008 Had a cisco unit along with a seperate modem. Use Vonage, and have quite a few wireless connections between phones, ipads etc. Also have 2 games systems, Vonage IP phone, and my DirecTV. With all that said, I have a 3.0M Connection, and a 512k Upload. Thats alot of info for such a slow connection, but that is all that is offered in my area. My old Cisco unit would make IP phone impossible unless network traffic was nill. Very slow all around. Swapped to this one, and love it. Data traffic management is great, and allows use of all itam at once with very few problems. Only issue is the set up is marginal at best, and if power goes out, MINE has to re set up agin. Dont know if thats a normal thing. But very happy otherwise.

..

6006840060008 I gave the thing the benefit of the doubt and assigned a 3 to performance & value. I was disappointed after running the install process for the 4th time, in still continued to say cannot find equipment 2247-N8. I really tried to make it work, but it refused. Maybe I bought a bad unit. I returned it a purchased a NG N 300-2200. It was up and running within 15 minutes.

38759318 So I got this for Christmas, and I wanted a Microphone that was Cheap, But Good for gaming.... Well, It met most of My Standards, it was great for Chatting and For Gaming, and Pretty much the Sound Quality and Microphone reliability was Good.... However, It's not a Durable Headset.... I would run into the Wires by accident, and the Microphone can break if You're not careful.... and Not to mention, somehow the ear pieces can come off by accident, but they go back in easily in a snap. But overall, It is a Good Headset to start with, and I would definitely recommend this for Business professionals. But for Gamers, try to be careful with this Headset, since it can break If You're not careful with it.....

Hope this review helps others out with getting a Cool new headset.....

Sincerely,
SoundFX09.

..

38759318 I would not buy again if given the chance . Had them about 2 weeks and they fell apart.

..

38759318 This headset is very good for short term use such as phone calls and listening to music. They don't really offer anything special in audio quality and lack bass. The microphone is pretty good and I haven't had any complaints from the people I talk to with it.

The big problem is with the ear pad design. These things are a killer on the ears after more than 30 mins of use. The ear pads are flat and press against your whole ear, which can hurt after a while. I have to take them off just to give my ears a break.

All in all a BASIC headset. You get what you pay for.

..

38759318 A really good buy for the money. Very comfortable to wear for long periods of time. Microphone seems to work well, friends say sound is very good. The in line controls are slimmer then other headsets I have used, so they are less likely to catch on things. The pads collect a bit of hair, but not a big problem. There is no low bass, but they still sound good. To get really good bass it costs at least 2-3 times as much in my experience. So if you don't want to spend a lot on your headset, these are the ones for you.

..

38759318 For 30 bucks your not going to get better....the sound from this headset is off the charts, great bass, and in some of your favorite games it picks up sound you didn't even know exsisted. The mic is great and picks up perfectly, without being in the way, as it is extended off the the side. It fits comfortably and well, at times I don't even hardly notice i'm wearing it.

..

38759318 I bought this after my other headset died on me. I wanted to get one that had 3.5mm jacks instead of USB (it's just easier). I found this for $20 and figured it would be decent. I got home, plugged it in, and started listening to music. For the price, the sound quality is very good. Moreover, it is also quite comfortable. I like it a lot more than the $60 Logitech headset I previously had. The mic quality is also excellent. The only thing I don't like is the ear pieces can pop out of the joint if you're not careful. Of course, all you have to do is just pop it back in. Unfortunately, my dog got a hold of it and chewed one of the foam pads in half. So now I have to deal with that. Maybe tech support can help me get replacement pads?

..

38759318 Bought this headset for a language-learning app. Did not work well. Not sure if it was a user or computer issue or a problem with the headset. Returned it and got a USB headset by Dynex which is working well. (this headset is analog--2 plugs that plug into the mike and phone jacks)

Enjoy your favorite tunes while jogging or working out with this arm band that features durable stretch polyester construction and a protective cover to keep your iPhone safe.

40278103 I've used this on 2 long runs and many short ones, so far it works great. The only drawback is the plastic screen. it makes it hard to see and it is not real touch sensitive.

40278103 Might work well for some but not so great for me. Doesn't fit if you have bigger arms

..

40278103 I am a road cyclist and love this arm band for my I Phone. It adjusts to anyone's arm size and keeps my phone in place while I ride. This allows me to listen to music on my rides which is so helpful and much needed on long rides!

..

40278103 Poorly made paid way too much this should be priced at $9.95 to match how badly it's made. Ugly looking and not good for larger arms. Total waste of money!

..

40278103 I hate having to remove my iPhone from its OtterBox to use this. The plastic is not tight enough, so I am unable to use the touchscreen to access my workout apps. I wish I had not wasted my money on this.

40278103 Do not bother wasting your money on this item. The armband is either too loose or too tight. It was slipping off of my arm during my entire work out. The screen protector feels like cheap plastic that isn't tight to the screen. In other words, when you try to swipe on your phone, you can't because the plastic is too loose to do so. I can't even begin to tell you how disappointed with this purchase I am. I will be returning the item tomorrow.

..

40278103 The neoprene material makes my arm really hot when exercising. Fastening buckle is more challenging than the Belkin FastFit. Got that model when I returned this one.

..

40278103 In order to place your iPhone in the armband, you must first take it out of the other protective case you may have the device in, then slide it into the armband. It is a pain to constantly swap from one form or protection to the other. After doing this for a week, both protective covers are now loose. I would like to find a case that snaps on to an armband. I had one like this for my previous iPods, and never had any issues.

6006840400006 I found this to be an excellent purchase for my business needs.

..

6006840400006 overall very satisfied, . the fan is a little bit loud but for that price is ok, not disturbing

..

6006840400006 It was easy a breeze to set up and manage. We found it a bit darker than we'd like watching a movie. When I tried to use it to display a document it was so dark that I had to get 2 feet from the screen just to read it. It was in focus yes, and yes the plastic was removed from the lens. So we returned it. As great of an idea as it was, this unit just didn't work.

..

6006840400006 Good for about 175 yards. Anything longer is blurry. For the price and what you get it works great. I put a tripod adaptor on the standard threaded receiver so I can spot while standing.

..

6006840400006 Haven't used it a lot but so far very nice. Carrying case a good a thing to have. Overall nice product.

..

6006840400006 Recommended for the first timer. Though not super...still love it.

..

6006840400006 overall it works great. price value is great. will recommend it to friends.

..

6006840400006 Perfect scope for target spotting and wilderness outings. Lightweight and compact, easy to carry and set up.

..

6006840400006 Good for a beginner. You'll want a tall tripod to use it with the straight viewfinder. I have enjoyed it a lot. For $80, it was well worth it. Most scopes are in excess of $200 for even a basic scope.

..

6006840400006 Simple ,perfect and better then expected and very affordable.

..

6006840400006 I got this spotter on a black Friday deal last year for $99.00. I've used it religiously in every outdorr adventure since then- have thrashed it around, and still works perfectly

View the night sky with this telescope that features a 3x Barlow lens for enhanced magnification and high-transmission optical coatings for bright, clear images. Slow-motion controls allow smooth tracking.


..

6006840400006 Overall good quality product. Simple enough for a beginner to use.

..

6006840400006 I bought the Celestron - PowerSeeker 1000mm Newtonian Reflector Telescope for my son for Christmas and it is very powerful and a great value for the price! This is a great beginner telescope!

..

6006840400006 For a starter, this scope does well. If you want to track objects, look for a better scope. Also, the tripod is average.

..

6006840400006 I love the scope, easy to use and is powerful. However Best Buy should tell people it come from a third party company. Was told it would be in, in 7 days. But took 10 days.

..

6006840400006 This telecope is great for a beginner like me and my 6-year old son. We're having fun looking at the moon and the different constellations and planets up close for the first time. Highly recommended!!

..

6006840400006 I bought this telescope as a starter one. i have loved using it.

..

6006840400006 This is my first telescope and so far it has been great. Right away you have to know that deep space objects and planets will not look like they do on the magazines or books. Those come from professional telescopes or from Hubble. However this telescope will help you get acquainted with the basic concepts in astronomy, like the celestial grid, Declination, Right Ascension, the different types of eyepieces and even astrophotography. Be ready to spend another 50 to 100 bucks on accessories if you want to get the maximum potential out of this telescope. I recommend the driver motor, the accessory kit with more eyepieces and the T-ring and adapter for a digital camera. It is a great way to dip your toe on astronomy and if you find out you like it you can move on to a more expensive equipment, if not the you only spend like 200 bucks tops.

..

6006840400006 48 year old beginner here with looking into the sky.
For a first telescope I found it pretty easy to calibrate the finder scope with the main scope (follow directions).
Using a "smart" phone with Google Sky app to first locate planets to seek out with the telescope is a great combination! I hold my phone towards the sky and the gps points out the spot.
I have been using less than a month and take it outside most clear evenings to look at Jupiter (see its four main moons too) ,Neptune (glows like a blue jem!), The Moon ( bright and clear!,can see texture details!) I am sure there are more powerful and computer gps guided telescopes for prices up into thousand dollars +. This one I have is portable to take to other locations,quick setup. Still learning and having a blast looking into the sky! It amazes me! Someday will probably upgrade! This scope has me hooked!
This summer will be better than after Christmas winter night looking. I plan on taking the scope out to better open locations away from city and suburban lights. Will be looking out over Cedar Lake Indiana skies all summer!

Griffin Survivor for iPad - iPad - Black - Silicone, Polycarbonate


..

6006840400006 I am very pleased with this case. No issues with it so far and it does as intended, which is protect my ipad. Stylsh color as well.

..

6006840400006 Really bulky, camera lens was cover at all times, bought another cover.

..

6006840400006 I think the product does what it is meant to do, though I haven't dropped or wet my iPad yet. The clip is relatively easy to come off and I already lost it. Also it is rather difficult to open the clip into standing position.

..

6006840400006 Works great got a great price very happy! Survived a vacation in the car over 5000 miles

..

6006840400006 Overall, i'm happy with the purchase, the case it tough, easy to hold, protects the ipad well enough, but the fit isn't perfect. When snapping the device in, one corner of the case wouldn't completely latch on, leaving a bit of give when you apply pressure. If dropped specifically in this spot, the give my lead to damage, but overall its very secure. If you don't mind it not being a perfect fit, for the price, it does the job.

..

6006840400006 I would definitely recommend this case to a friend. It's durable and long lasting.

..

6006840400006 Very good product if your looking for a strong way to protect an expensive investment and extend the lifespan of the ipad. It is easy to assemble and provides good strong cover that enables the ipad to be taken almost anywhere with minimal risk to damaging the product. Very good investmetn from a company that makes some of the best protective cases for the iphone.

..

6006840400006 I liked the looks of this product but it did not fit into the purse I carry my I pad in.

..

6006840400006 Protects the ipad very well especially from messy kids hands. Just wipe it off and is like new. Also protects from falls. Feels sturdy enough to absorb shocks but is comfortable to hold onto

..

6006840400006 After my kids dropped our 4th generation iPad onto our hard tile floors for the 3rd time in 14 months (each time meant a new screen...thank goodness I had a protection plan) I finally decided to get some protection. This unit appealed to my younger girls (pink) and to me because of its Military Grade Rating. Still not water proof...but water resistant. Shock durability was a big plus for me. I made a video review of this item. Check it out. Although this product wasn't as rigid as I hoped, it does seem to offer solid protection. Recommend.

6006840400006 This computer is a piece of junk. Worked 1 & half days. Has been doing "repairing disk errors" for the past 10 hours. LOL HP computers are not as good as they used to be.

..

6006840400006 This laptop runs so slow. I should have returned it right away, but I did not use it right away, had to wait for someone to help me get it set up and that took several weeks, so by time I realized it is to late to return.

..

6006840400006 This was purchased for my daughter for college. Button spacing and positioning isn't quite right and don't press quite right. Seems to miss the letters. Battery is terrible. She used for 20 minutes then closed the cover for the night and the battery was dead the next morning.

..

6006840400006 We like being able to use it around the house, instead of one place. Windows 8 is new to us. We just have to get used to this program .

6006840400006 great geek support as came with windows 8 program & needed help

6006840400006 Returned product after first use. Was not happy with quality or operation of it

6006840400006 There are many things on this machine I haven't learned how to use yet, but HP Support is great. I had heard how screwed up 8.1 was, and hard to use, but not really that bad.

..

6006840400006 All in all it is a excellent printer/fax/scanner/and copier especially since we use it in a very fast paced and busy office. After learning how everything worked it is great. No matter what you need done it takes seconds to do it. The best part is the amount of toner it uses. We print and copy lots of things on a day to day basis and it is not even close to running out of toner compared to our old ink jet printer that used ink very rapidly. This printer has saved us lots of time and money.

..

6006840400006 Used mostly as a printer scanner copier and has been working great.

Learn more about the New WindowsWith built-in wireless networking, this Asus M70ADUS003S desktop lets you easily access Web content. NVIDIA GeForce GTX 650 graphics with 1GB of dedicated video memory enable you to enjoy lush visuals when connected to a display (not included).


..

6006840400006 Asus is a major player in the manufacturing of Motherboards, video cards and peripherals for computers for about 25 years now so it's a no-brainer that a direct intel partner would come up with a winning combination of computer technology to create a very fast desktop with some ingenuity and sure enough Asus came up with a very unique desktop that sets itself apart.
Looking at the specs we see the M70AD looks respectable in the hardware department intel i7 4th generation processor, 16GB of DDR3 1600Mhz Memory (8Gx2 Installed) and it appears this unit uses a micro atx board so 2 slots are all that's available, this might be unacceptable to those of you that work in the video/graphics world and most likely upgrading to it's max memory of 32GB would be quite a costly affair considering what a single 16GB module would cost. Still for most people 16GB is overkill and adequate for their needs.
An Nvidia GTX 760 1GB video card is a very nice mid-range selection for this computer obviously not designed for pro-gamers or power users who edit video on a professional scale but for the average user this video card is more than enough to play today's video games with decent frame rates and detail turned up to take advantage of today's game graphics.
I talked my folks into buying this model since their 10+ year old desktop was slowing them down I stressed to them the importance of buying a computer from the very company that engineers the internal parts and they agreed and now they enjoy the speed of this computer that never slows down for anything it is a juggernaut a brute that can calculate zero's & one's as good as some higher priced big named computers.
Hard Drive space is ample at 1 TB with the added mSATA ssd used for caching it surely speeds things up being that the Sata 1 TB hard drive is about the only bottleneck this computer has so with all caching going to the lightning fast ssd msata we have a quick response time on startups coming out of sleep mode and loading programs it just rips right through everything you use on a daily basis.
Optical drives are becoming like Swiss army knives and this computer offers you a CD/DVD burner that is also Blu-ray compliant which means it will play your Blu-rays no problem just not burn Blu-ray discs.
On the front upper panel you will find a 16 in 1 card reader with two USB 2.0 and two 3.0 slots so everything is covered here and it is easily accessible. In the rear four USB 2.0 slots are provided. Whats really nifty is the front panel door slides down and out of the way which is much nicer than a swinging door to cover your drives and open slots.
One thing you will notice about this computer is how quiet it is sometimes you won't be sure if its even running and almost no heat is sensed these things my folks were very happy about their last unit was loud and put out warmth.
I have always used ASUS motherboards and Video graphics cards for the past 10 years on my custom builds this is what I stressed to my folks and I do the same for you... Trust ASUS they are the producers of the finest computer parts in the world and now they make a fine desktop as well its super fast..super quiet and reasonably priced considering you are getting alot of power for the cost of a laptop.
Thrown in it's own power backup system in case of a power outage..yes it will give you the time to save your work before it shuts down & the fact that this computer has a tray on-top that will charge your smart phone with no power cables attached and with your smart phone you can login and access files which are important to business users that need syncing of important data all the way round this Asus is a top choice in my book and a great value.

..

6006840400006 This was my first desk purchase top in over a decade and I wanted something really nice, as well as already loaded with Windows 8.1. This is an impressive piece of hardware with far more features than I am ever likely to use. Speed is incredible and the graphics are outstanding so that only hardcore gamers might want more power. There is plenty of memory so unless you do video editing you will be just fine. The cabinet is quite attractive and not nearly as large as it looks in the photos. It runs very quietly and stays cooler than I had expected, although I do run an auxiliary off one of the front USB connections. he only issue is the lack of USB connections at the rear; there are only four and all are USB2. Figuring a keyboard, mouse, my Bose sound system, web camera/microphone, and the printer...Well, it come up short. The printer and the Bose system won't run well (the Bose not at all# off a USB hub and the wireless mouse also dislikes it. Realistically two more USB connectors in the back would be fine but four more would be even better! There are two USB2 and two USB3 connections in the front as well as the DVD/Blue ray device, along with headphones and microphone connections, all of which can be neatly covered by the sliding door giving a smooth and attractive look to the unit #although my girlfriend claims it looks like a refrigerator!#. Set up was easy; it booted and loaded right up and was ready to use in just minutes. I currently connect a 27" #HDMI# in landscape, a 17" #VGA# monitor in portrait as well as a 24" HDTV #HDMI), all with no issues and I think it will support even more displays than that if you need them. For daily use this is way above anything that you'd ever need but for guys like myself who just like neat toys, watch movies and play games at a moderate level it impossible to find fault with it, save the need for more USB connections. The mouse and keyboard are very average and since chances are you will be using your own devices so they are not worth discussing.

..

6006840400006 I bought this computer to replace an old laptop that was extremely slow. I am amazed how fast this computer is. I click and it's done. No waiting 20 minutes for it to boot up either. It is the quietest computer I have ever seen. You don't even know it is on. Although this was a little overkill for me, it means I won't have to buy another computer for a long, long time.

6006840400006 This is a fast, quiet, sleek and so far reliable desktop pc and has lots of great features.

Crank the volume from your Bluetooth-enabled audio device with this Ion Audio Road Rocker Bluetooth speaker system, which features a 2-way speaker for rich, dynamic sound. The rechargeable battery allows up to 50 hours of playback between charges.


..

6006840400006 loved this item, price was incredible and so convient to travel with.its like a mobile party you control.

..

6006840400006 I purchased this audio to use in Physical Education classes outside. Design is great and not many buttons or controls makes it simple and easy to operate. It is not going to do the job, simply because the sound is distorted bad at higher volume. If listening on volume 3-4, the sound is OK. With the increase of the volume, somewhere at level 5-6, the base sounds terrible. Playing audio with no base was fine on higher volume.
I'd like to have the same system with quality speakers, that can handle the volume coming from the amp.

..

6006840400006 Saw it for cheap. Been eyeing an outdoor/portable/bluetooth speaker for awhile. The higher end one had a radio on it, but I figured that I could use an app instead.
Got it and was very excited...until I turned it up past the 4th notch....and the distortion began.
It wasn't even at LOUD yet. Changed the setting on my phone to help. They didn't.
Contacted company. Have not heard back from them.
I don't recommend...unless I have a defective one and if this isn't normal, then I would...it's got a lot of fun features.

..

6006840400006 This ION Road Rocker is a decent size, easy to take around with you at the pool, around the house, in the back yard, in the car... etc. The sound is loud enough to hear from far away even outside. It has very good sound, but not audiophile quality. However, I was a little disappointed with the bass response. I was expecting a little more since its in a larger box shape. Behind the sturdy black mesh grille is a 3.5 inch woofer, a 1 inch tweeter and 3/4 inch bass port. With my phone paired, I can crank the volume up to about the 7th mark before it starts getting distorted. So if you have a quiet song you should be able to crank it all the way up without distortion. The PA function kind of sucks. If you want to hear yourself talk or sing, you have to crank up the mic volume and lower the main volume as whatever is playing on the main volume will over-power the mic. The USB charging port on top next to the dock only works when the charger is plugged into the Road Rocker. You cannot use the main battery to charge your device. The dock is kind of narrow, so if you have a bulky phone + case it may have a hard time sitting in there. The shiny corner protectors are a nice feature to protect from bumping while carrying it around. On the back of the box are 3 green LED lights that tell you the charge level of the battery. I ran this box continuously for at least 10 hours before the first LED light turned off. Don't let the battery run to nothing, make sure you charge it as it says after each long use. The bluetooth range is about 20-30 feet depending if you have walls in the way of the speaker and your playing device. I use this thing almost every day and I'm very pleased with it. For the price and features it has you can't beat this Road Rocker.

It's nice to know I don't have to buy batteries for a wireless keyboard, and the connection between the keyboard and my PC is flawless. No lag whatsoever. It's a great addition for your PC, especially if you want to cut out wires going to and from.
Key response is perfect, and it's slim profile fits well with any computer setup. I highly recommend this keyboard.

..

6006840400006 This is my second one. I spilled a drink on my first one after having it for a couple of years and it damaged the solar panel and wouldn't recharge. So far this one has been great. They have made some improvements. Just make sure you don't spill any liquids on it.....

..

6006840400006 I was looking for a wireless mouse and keyboard to help reduce the river of cords plugged into our outlets. The Solar Wireless Keyboard stood out from the crowd of offerings on the Best Buy shelf. It uses solar power, not just from sunlight, but also from the regular lighting in your house. This really appeals to my energy consciousness. The design is super slim and the keys feel great under my fingers when I type. Cleaning it is a breeze and it stays shiny with the swipe of a soft cloth. It was a little more expensive than the other wireless keyboard, but I had to try it and I'm glad I did. I like it much better than any keyboard I have ever used. Now my friends want one.

..

6006840400006 This item is super easy to install configure to multi sync so I only have to use one Logitech USB dongle. extreamly reliable.

..

6006840400006 Compact and slim, this keyboard has a great touch/feel and holds a solsr charge for a long time. Even indoors away from any window it gets its charge for long enough that you don't have to worry about its reliability.

..

6006840400006 It's a wireless keyboard that does not require batteries. That's generally it in a nutshell. The keyboard is in a bedroom where it receives moderate light and has yet to dip below 96%, and even when that low, gets back to 100% after a few hours without use. I generally am on my PC 3 to 4 hours a day.
My only complaint is some occasional input lag where the keyboard takes several seconds to respond. Thus far in about 3 months, this has happened only twice. It seems to last until I unplug the unifying receiver then plug it back in. Otherwise, it more than serves its purpose.

..

6006840400006 Flat, doesn't slide around, quiet, no batteries, easily switches between computers, has a number pad I could go on and on

..

6006840400006 Love the ease of use. Setting up was easy and quick. I use it with my MAC and it works just as seamlessly as my MAC specific keyboards.

..

6006840400006 purchased this for my daughter along with another that included
a monitor. she was excited that she can use both cameras for the
children's room.

..

6006840400006 After we got it set up this system is a must have for new parents. It tracks the baby's movement, even with the lights off as well as lets us hear him and audibly alerts us when he is awake. Great for mom's and dad's who want to have worry free time in another room while the baby takes a snooze!

Surf the Web while you're out and about using this Mach Speed Trio tablet that features built-in Wi-Fi for simple Internet connectivity. The 7" LCD capacitive multitouch screen displays content clearly and simplifies navigation.


..

6006840400006 I had to send the product back to Mach Speed for a few glitches. Mach Speed customer service was prompt and courteous as we communicated via email and phone. They quickly sent a replacement even before they received the defective product. Not sure how their other products are, but they got it right in customer service.

..

6006840400006 Horrible product, but it was super cheap so I wasn't expecting anything 'great'. Even with low expectations the product still managed to surprise me with it's terrible lack of compatibility and clunky web-surfing abilities. Tried it out for 10 days and returned it since there aren't many apps compatible with it's processor and even something as simple and time-tested as browsing the internet seems to be a real chore for this little device.
Google Playstore runs after some hacking, but none of the apps will load from that store. On the Amazon store most apps I tried to load ended up saying the device wasn't compatible, but I did manage to get a few working.
The OOB so called "app store" is nothing more than a static web page with a few links to 10 or less apps that actually work on the product. It's a few games and a few productivity apps, nothing special.

..

6006840400006 the tablet itself is really great for what I use it for. The only problem I have so far is finding a case for it, there all to big or to small and the only good ones I can find put the power button in a bad location

..

6006840400006 Have an inexpensive Garmin that I purchased several years ago. Bought this to upgrade, because I could update maps. Without the auto zoom as speeds change I will be right on top of a turn or destination before it shows on the map. When turned on it takes so long for it to start receiving signals I can drive two or three blocks and it still thinks I'm in the driveway. Same thing if a turn is missed or there is a detour. Also I can be driving in the right lane and go through an intersection and this things thinks I turned right. Very disappointed. I've gone back to the old Garmin. MONEY WASTED

..

6006840400006 I got this item on sale for under a hundred dollars, works fine, no problems. Happy customer

..

6006840400006 2 days after I placed the order it arrived.
The item was brand new, and right out of the box it didn't work.
After it was connected to the car charger, it still did not power on.
I am very disappointed in Magellan in recent years.
I immediately returned it, and got the Tom Tom Via 1605TM.
It was definitely worth the $50 difference.
I suggest you look at the Tom Tom Via 160

Designed to keep your business running while you're on the move, this streamlined notebook boasts corporate-level manageability and convenient handling. An eco-friendly design and energy-conserving features help save cost, as well as the environment.


..

6006840400006 At the outset, let me make two statements. First, I am verty impressed with this system, and will explain why in the words that follow. Second, I am not in any way shape or form associated with Acer, nor do I (as far as I know) own any stock in that company, In fact, Acer gobbled up two companies I didn't care much for - Gateway and Packard Bell. If you are what you eat, this system would have proven that. Fortunately it did not.
To begin with, here was what I was looking for:
Portable, preferably 14": I often find myself traveling - the portability has become more important to me over time
Windows 7 Professional: Proven performance without the silliness of Metro
Discrete graphics: Not a gamer, but I do a lot of video editing on Adobe Premiere
Minimum 3 USB ports: I had three on my last 15.4" laptop and it was barely enough
HDMI port: Why not? I'd like that capability, having used it on the last machine I owned
Backlit keyboard: When I need to take one of my frequent glances down at the keys, it's nice to see them...
Bluetooth: Bluetooth peripherals mean free USB ports
Everything else? Gravy. I didn't think my price range (hugging the thousand dollar line) would even accommodate my list with any true quality, nor did I think I be lucky enough to find it all in one package. And things were not looking good. Best Buy's marketplace filtering algorithm didn't help. In fact, it completely missed. Selecting for dedicated graphics excluded this laptop, and I found it only after I had already ordered the Windows 8 Asus Vivobook V301! Fortunately, I was able to cancel that order. Word of caution: it might be worth wading through the choices without relying on the filters.
This system ticked all my boxes and just kept on ticking. Having used it for almost a week, I have no buyer's remorse about what I think is one of the best deals out there on a quality laptop. I suspect this one will be overlooked by many searching the Acer Aspire line. It's not as sexy or flashy as a V7, but it's business-like exterior reflects some serious construction and design. This system is all about durability, performance and capability.
Durability
The carbon fiber shell built around a magnesium alloy cage FEELS like quality. This is a very solid build. Even the lid/screen is sturdy, with minimal flex. Holding the base of the system and pushing with one finger at either corner of the screen, I was able to easily go from closed to full open (about 160 degrees) and closed again with almost no deforming torque on the lid, and definitely no impact on the pixels of the screen. That not only speaks for the lid, but also for the solid metal hinges, which seem perfectly calibrated for smooth motion and accurate positioning.
There is no flex in the keyboard, and despite my concern after reading a review of the short key travel, the key presses are even, consistent and give good tactile feedback. A fledgling touch-typist, the position of the touch pad is not an issue, as it was on my VAIO (where a glance of the wrist sent the cursor scurrying to the top of the page in the middle of typing a sentence).
Performance
Boot-up to the log-in screen takes 14 seconds, and log-in takes about 8 seconds (mainly for my ESET antivirus splash screen to disappear). MS Word loads in less than two seconds. Photoshop CS5 loads in 3 seconds. The snappiness is due in large part to the solid state drive. You'll notice it wasn't on my list - and there was a reason. At the price point I was looking, I doubted that was something I could afford. Having never used SSD before, I also had the advantage - now gone - of not knowing what I was missing. Considering the speed and projected (but not proven) reliability of solid state drives over the spinning mechanics of hard disk drives, it would seem to make all the sense for SSD to be on the priority list of any new laptop PC.
The performance comes down to details. Like all 3 USB ports meeting 3.0 standards. Like 8 GB dual channel RAM with room for expansion. Like pairing it all together with a fourth generation i-core processor and solid state drive resulting in almost no bottlenecks. I am convinced that it's really more than just throwing a bunch of great components together. This system was carefully thought out, and it shows.
Capability
The capacity to do work is more than just about speed. It's about the ability of the system to handle the graphics load, carry the data, connect to the network, accommodate the USB peripherals, provide usable power for extended periods without an AC receptacle, and keep things secure.
The SSD is generous in terms of size. Not sure 256 GB is enough? In addition to Windows 7 Pro, I have full Microsoft Office and Adobe suites installed. Added to a few other programs like my anti-virus (NOD32), Revo, etc - I have only used about 64 GB. There is an open bay for another internal drive (SSD or HDD) in case expansion is required, but the connecting cable is not included.
Security is serious on this business-class machine - from the fingerprint reader to Acer's own management software, it is reminiscent of the ThinkPad's approach.
Another amazing capability is the battery. The Haswell i7/4500U processor uses half the power of the third generation (Ivy Bridge) CPU. Translation? Amazing battery life! After the first charge, I wanted to recycle the battery two or three times to full depletion. On my old VAIO EB - no problem - leave it on and find it dead in 2-3 hours. This Acer? It took nearly nine hours of word processing, browsing and the occasional online video to deplete my system to shut down.
The one category I did not mention was value. I will say that I saw a lot of laptops costing much more that offered less.
I honestly cannot think of many negatives in this price class, although I suppose I could list a lot of improvements comparing it outside it's class. I do wish the ports had a better layout - two of the three USB ports are front right, and interfere with the use of an external mouse for righties like me. The screen is plenty bright - at 14", I can see at full HD and still keep the icons set to small with no magnification factors. That said, it is not quite as brilliant as my glossy VAIO screen. And I'll say it shamelessly - I wish it looked a bit cooler. Like that silver Acer Aspire V7. My VAIO was blue. It didn't do much, but it sure looked good not doing it.
So far, having owned a Dell Latitude, an IBM (now Lenovo) ThinkPad and a VAIO, this is by far the best one. It won't be the prettiest or sleekest looking laptop at Starbucks. But it'll blow the others out of the water with what's under the hood.

..

40686992 Overall, this product is OK for the money. The box is great, sets up easily and fairly easy to use. The accessories however are flimsy. Tripod will be great for a tiny camera like a GoPro but thats about it. The lights are easy to use but very unstable. Instructions are non-existent which was a problem when one of the bulbs burned out within 15 minutes. FYI  To replace the bulb twist counter clockwise about 60 deg to remove the bulb. (I broke the bulb trying to figure that one out) It takes a GU10 base MR16, instructions would have been helpful for this part. Other than that, this unit does what it was made for, creating an environment for taking close up product shots.

Transfer your files, user accounts and settings from a PC with Windows XP, Vista or 7 to a PC with Windows 8 using this 8' Belkin F4U060 easy transfer cable, which features USB connectors for a simple connection. On-screen prompts guide you through the process.


..

38708104 I read all the information that Best Buy had available on their site for this item to make sure I could use on my systems and the most important part they left out. I didn't find that out until I received the product. It will work from 32 bit systems to 32 or 32 to 64 bit systems but will not work if you have a 64 bit to 32 bit and 64 to 64 bit system.
All the spec info on the site says you can transfer files from windows xp vista and 7 to windows 8. It says nothing about 32 or 64 bit systems.

..

38708104 Didn't work for me, not sure why. Might be a waste of money to purchase. Maybe it is just my no computer knowledge skills. LOL

..

38708104 quick set up and use. It took more time to get it out of the package than to hook up and start the file transfer.

..

38708104 Had to finally replace my computer of 12 years and I was amazed at how much data was transferred that I had forgotten about.

..

38708104 needed to transfer data from several devices. this worked great no matter what devices were being used.

..

38708104 Works great. Very easy to use and hook up. It is very easy to use with the instructions that are provided.

..

38708104 Excellent product, literally does all of the work for you. Only downside is you cannot choose which files to transfer, or at least if you could I didn't see how.

..

38708104 THIS WAS EASY TO TRANSFER FROM ONE COMPUTER TO ANOTHER

..

38708104 We bought this when we bought a new computer, at the salesmens suggestion to make things easier. It did not work at all. We took it back to best buy, but we live 100 miles away, so we did it after the 15 day return policy limit. So they would only give us store credit and deducted almost $10 for "Restocking Fee".

..

38708104 trying to use a cable between two comps doesn't work, oh yeah the people at best buy totally convinced my parents that it was a good buy, um no. i am comp literate and this thing confused the hell out of me. told me one thing, then another, made no sense at all. definitely not worth the buy if anything get a flash drive and transfer from one comp to another or have the geek squad do it. waste of money.

Belkin SurgePro BV106050-CW 6-Outlets Surge Suppressor - 6, USB - 900 J - 5 V DC Output


..

38708104 Loved the product and was on sale when I ordered. Can't beat $9 for this.

..

38708104 It works for all iDevices, but not my TouchPad. :(

..

38708104 Purchased Belkin 6-Outlet Surge Protector(Model: BV106050-CW) a little over a month ago(am outside the 30 day return period).
It worked fine for the first month and it stopped working(wouldn't charge or power anything).
Contacted BestBuy and they said its outside the 30 day return period.
Contacted Belkin and they said BestBuy is not an authorized online reseller, so they will not help!

..

38708104 It's a product with great features, The USB works probably. I like yet

..

38708104 There's a plastic post that's intended to be inserted into the grounding pole of the second in a dual pole outlet. It doesn't line up perfectly on some of the newer outlet covers. When I first used this device, the plastic pole was bent out of shape and I removed it. I think it's only for stability, anyway and may not be needed. Anyway, this multi-outlet extension is great, because you almost never have enough outlets in hotel rooms. In addition, there are two USB charging outlets that are really useful to charge both our iPhones every evening. I'm impressed with this device, especially since it's protected by Belkin surge protector technology.

..

38708104 USB ports worked for a few minutes. The USB ports no longer charge my devices. The regular ports work fine. Don't buy this if you plan on using the USB ports to charge devices.

..

38708104 I have a ton of Apple stuff and if you own it and you use it, which I do, it is always needing to be recharged. I automatically just plug my Iphone in when I walk in the house. My wife does the same thing, so having two plugs really helps and being able to plug in 6 other items and having a surge protector is a bonus. I also have a couple of Ipods, and Ipad and some other devices that require USB charging so this is handy for that as well. I have one in my kitchen, my living room, and the bedroom, since I use the Ipone as my alarm clock and it needs charging there as well. This is a high powered charger and can charge some of the larger items like the Ipad with no problem.

..

38708104 The specs for this surge protector state that the usb ports are capable of 1.6A. The label on the back says 750 mA for each port. That would be a total of 1.5A, not 1.6A. The main reason I purchased this was to charge my phone and tablet.

..

38708104 I actually love this thing. I was a bit concerned there would be an issue with the USB charging port for my phone. If I used an aftermarket charger with my HTC Evo 3d, the touchscreen would act funky while it was plugged in. I was hoping that wouldn't happen using the charging ports on this surge protector. The phone works fine while plugged in! It charges normally, as well.
I like the fact that I can screw this in to the outlet so I don't have to worry about it falling off of the wall.

Bytecc External Slimline Floppy Drive - 1.44MB - 1 x Type A USB 2.0 USB - 3.5" External

38708104 I needed a floppy drive to access some old files. I have Windows 7 and all I had to do was plug it in and I was able to immediately access the files I needed to. Great device, great price! And when the first one they sent didn't work, IT Wholesalers sent another one out right away.

..

38708104 I couldn't find anywhere in the description on what versions of Windows that supported this USB drive. If I had seen it, I would have looked elsewhere because I need this item for Windows 8.1 or Windows 7....

These Cisco Linksys PLEK400 Powerline A/V adapters allow you to network your Ethernet-enabled devices, including PCs, game consoles and more. HomePlug A/V technology features up to 200 Mbps speed for fast data transfer.


..

38708104 Unbelieveably easy to install, exceptional performance. Simple as take the device out of the box, plug into your routher (with an ethernet cord), plug into a wall socket; plug the second adaptor into the second device's wall socket and plug that internet capable device (via ethernet cord) to the adaptor, and no matter the house location the second device receives exceptional high speed interent coverage.

This Cisco Linksys EA2700-NP dual-band wireless router features MIMO technology to enable fast data streaming and increased range and reliability. Four 10/100/1000 Gigabit Ethernet ports allow easy connection of peripherals.


..

38708104 don't waste your money! I've had COUNTLESS problems with this router, calling customer service at least 20 times since I've had it (not kidding). by the way, each call lasted over an hour without a solution - most of the time i figured it out myself. oh and its app enabled apparently? none of that worked on my iPhone or iPad. the cisco name has always lived up to its name thus far but now I'm confident that ill never buy any cisco product ever again.

..

38708104 Worked perfectly until it went up. If you need normal internet speeds, get this router.

..

38708104 Nothing fabulous but nothing bad either. Time will tell if the router is a good purchase as my old router(different brand) degraded after a year.

..

38708104 Allows gigabit throughput which lets me take advantage of higher network speeds other than 10/100 only. Looks good, works great and has surprisingly large range.
Recommend not sticking it in an enclosed space because it does give off heat. The more open the location the better. Allow some air around it.

..

38708104 Bought it for the parental control features. The higher speeds were a bonus for the price and kid safety.

Use this wireless USB adapter to connect your laptop to area wireless hotspots while you're on the go. WEP, WPA and WPA2 security encryption helps keep information private.


..

38708104 Works great for making our desktop wireless. It only took me a few minutes to install.

..

38708104 The signal is weak and drops too often. Lucky to get 3 bars on connection even though my router is only 20 feet away and in line of sight. My old adapter had 5 bars 90% of the time and only dropped service rarely.

..

38708104 No software, no hassle. Just plug to you r usb port, enter your network key and you are connected. I had an internal pci card with an antenna in the back...it was slow and unreliable. With this usb adapter I always have fast and reliable internet on my desktop!

..

38708104 I purchased this for a friend who wanted to connect her tower pc to her internet wirelessly. This product is great! The installation was completed in less than 5 minutes and now her tower PC is wireless. There is no lag in the download or upload speed. Great product!

38708104 THIS PRODUCT WORKS GOOD EASY TO USE SELF INSTALL NO PROBLEMS WINDOWS 7 READY

38708104 I'm running Windows 7 and it was literally just plug it in and we were online as soon as I entered my security key.

..

38708104 i bought this for my home theater setup about a month ago. i have a winxp desktop PC that i repurposed for my home theater. got a new HDMI equiped video card, blu ray drive for movies, wireless keyboard, and this usb wireless adapter.
reason i went with this is because i was worried about signal issues if i bought an internal wireless. wanted to ability to move the adapter around. also i trust the cisco name.
unfortunately, the installation was TOO simple. and i wasn't able to configure it specifically for my wireless setup. the setup is too streamlined. wished there was an advanced options or something to change the encryption type and length of the key, etc... this caused problems with initial setup. i was able to get it to work only after manually adding the wireless network via windows then installing the basic drivers for this adapter. if there was an advanced option for the setup, this would get 4 stars from me probably.
i've had quite a bit of dropped connections. transferring files from pc to pc in my network has been unreliable. moving a digital copy of a movie over has been very challenging with dropped connections. and i had netflix problems a couple times. im still investigating the dropped connections problem right now so i can't blame it on the adapter for sure but my other laptops at home do not experience this problem. they may have dropped connections occassionally but my home theater PC that uses this adapter will drop connection several times a day.
but.... for the price, u get a easy to setup wireless adapter. if u have a basic wireless setup at home then u wouldn't be complaining about setup. its a good price, easy setup, and when its connected it works fine. besides my dropped connections (which im still trying to isolate) im pretty satisfied.

..

38708104 Bought this product for a Compaq desktop running Vista but was very disatisfied because unit did not work as expected. Software comes embeded in unit including setup. Unit does not work if you turn computer with unit already left connected from previous use, unless you unplug and plug the unit again. Takes a long time for the computer to realize there is an wireless adapter. Transmission is not as fast as they claim. Not worth the price. packing box comes empty without specs or instruc.

..

38708104 see review @ Cisco Valet Plus router. Easy to install. Very good to excellent range.

..

38708104 This purchase was to bring an old (ca 2003) Dell pc into the wireless age. We recently transitioned from a wired network to a wireless network and the Cisco wireless hotspot and Valet connector did it with ease. I have very little networking knowledge and the set up was a breeze.

Stay informed while you're on the road with this radar detector that features 14-Band protection, including protection from X-Band, K-Band and Ka-Band radars. Visual alerts are displayed on your iPhone's screen for easy viewing.


..

38708104 You get what you pay for. This is a useless product

..

38708104 You really can't go wrong with this product. It's sleek, low-profile, and the app for the iPhone is easy to use. For the cost, it's great. You're able to save money on the other "full-featured" stand alone models because you're really only buying the detector head. All the software and features that are normally packaged inside the stand alone units, are in the app for this. So the manufacturer can cut the price down on these.
If I had to nit-pick something on this, it would be that if you leave it plugged into your car and walk away with your iPhone, it won't automatically re-sync once the car is started. You have to unplug it, then plug it back in. A minor annoyance, but worth mentioning.

..

38708104 I have had this for 3 days now. It has worked great for me and you can't beat the price! You have the option to record false alarm areas and report traps to a data base instantly. Very user friendly and very discrete when hard wiring it to your car. Hides nicely behind your mirror. You can get the hard wire kit on ebay for under $9. I ran the wire all along the edge of the head liner and down behind the pillar moldings directly to the fuse box. Wire it up to the ignition fuse and it will turn of and on with your car. Give it a few days before you decide to return it. It's well worth the money and does the same as my XRS R10G for much much less money.

..

38708104 I recommend a mount for your phone otherwise it's a cumbersome interface and dangerous while driving. But that aside it has detected every cop I've seen using radar or laser, false alerts are about the same as with my other radar detector. Use it enough and you'll figure them out. Good detector in my opinion!

..

38708104 I passed 3 cops after buying this product and I know that 2 were shooting radar. It never once went off. I am taking this back after Thanksgiving.

..

38708104 I purchased this and returned it in less than one day. I drove through a large city and an interstate highway. I passed several police officers, three of which were running radar/laser, a police station, and two highway patrol stations... This thing did not beep once. The only time it beeped was at a hospital due to the automatic doors. Doors opened and this thing beeped. That was it. Nothing else.
It looks nice and sleek, since its all black and has a nice shape, but it doesnt have a screen. It has one big mute button and the volume selector. The voice alerts are not very good either and often hard to hear. You cant select highway or city if you dont have your iphone/ipod with you, and you cant change any of the settings.
Save your money and buy another radar detector. You will regret it and you cannot count on this at all.

..

38708104 I am a huge electronics guru and this is not an impressive radar detector at all. The response of the vehicle speed and radar detection is delayed and the app displays that the device is not connected at times when the bluetooth clearly shows that the device is connected. Returned the same day I purchased.

..

38708104 I just bought this radar detector 2 days ago. Yesterday I was using it and I got a $204 speeding ticket! My first one in 15 years! And this Cobra radar detector was sitting right on my window, COMPLETELY SILENT! It never went off. No sound, no visual. I was a sitting duck. Packing it up and returning it today.

..

38708104 I bought the iRadar because I was intrigued with the idea that i could use my iPhone 4 for one more great application. Set up was easy and the iPhone app was very interactive. That's where it all ends. The iRadar was prone to many false alarms, both rural and urban. My community has the speed warning trailers positioned about to make drivers aware of how fast they are moving as they approach populated areas. The iRadar picked up the trailer about 1/4 mile upon approach. Not acceptable. As for Laser... I travel to CT often, (Laser Radar Heaven!!), and even having the iRadar positioned low on the windshield the iRadar struggled to pick up the laser signal. I was right on top of the police trap when it finally activated. One of the most annoying features of the iRadar and the deal breaker for me is the fact that the D/C power adapter consistently "popped out" of the lighter socket. I notice others have made the same observation in their reviews. Also, having two power cords on your dash is annoying and looks messy. So, bottom line I returned the iRadar to BestBuy and ended up shelling out the big bucks to buy an Escort 9500ix. Let me tell you.... This is the way to go given the fact that one ticket in MA can cost you over $3,000.00in the course of 6 years it remains on your record and jacks up your insurance. So like they say.... you get what you pay for. Take a pass on the iRadar and spend the extra money and buy an Escort!

..

38708104 I was skeptical at first, but once I downloaded the app it was clear that "I just had to have the actual devices ASAP.". I ran out to my local Best Buy picked it up and installed it. I love the display and the very clear messages being displayed (especially those of approaching red lights cameras). If you have an iPhone that is mounted to your dashboard while you drive, throw away your current radar detector and get iRadar and this app.
The iRadar and the app work alongside A2DP auto connections (I.e. you can play your music over you Bluetooth Audio while still receiving both visual and audio alerts). Initially it was a little challenging to get the two things working (thank you Pioneer) but now they work together as soon as I turn the key in the engine.
Get this gadget if you already have or plan to have an iPhone. I saw that they are trying to release an Android app (supposed to have been on 4/4/2011). It'll be okay with an iPad (if you have the roo. For one on your dashboard). If you have an iPod touch... Get an iPhone... The location based alerts will not work (I.e. Red light camera warnings)
A couple things that could be improved:
1. Even with the app "running in the background" the alerts don't show. The physical iRadar sounds only the radar alerts, you won't get the red light and other iDevice based warnings. This will definitely affect those of us who use our iDevices for navigation. 
2. Would be nice to change the music tracks of the playlist I'm currently playing from within the app (as is the case with many of the GpS Navigation out in the market).
3. Integrate Google Traffic in the map view (again so we don't have to switch out of the application to see this information).
4. The power adapter could be more snug in the cig lighter adapter. I tried several and it kept slipping out.

..

38708104 Maybe I just have a bad one, but this adapter is not working after one month. Taking this one back to BB.

..

38708104 This product is great. It installed in about five miinutes, and five minutes after that I was connected to our wireless network and online. It's actually how I'm writting this review right now. The only snag I ran into was during installation, windows refused to install some drivers that were not 'digitally signed'. However, I have not noticed any impact on the performance of this product, and find it's speed completely satisfactory for my online needs, even if it only picks up 72% of the wireless signal (router is ~20 feet away, transmitting through two brick and cinderblock walls).

..

38708104 For someone with limited computer knowledge, this works great for me.

..

38708104 So far I am very happy with the wireless.The price was fair for the value.

..

38708104 Orignally purchased Belkin N+ adapter to connect my VIsta 64 PC wirelessly to my DLINK 628 Dual Band N Router. That did not work at all so returned and purchased this adapter. Setup was pretty easy although it took a couple of tries to connect to the router, more my problem than the adapter. Connection now is 5x5 (adapter is located close to the router so I can't speak to connection from a distance or thru walls. Internet response is same as when PC was directly connected to router with ethernet. Also wireless printer is working fine with no drop off in response or printer speed (again located close to router).

..

38708104 D-Link Tech Support advised me to upgrade to the DWA-160, but the unit won't connect. They claim it doesn't support Windows 7, but my laptop is running XP and I couldn't get any love there either.

..

38708104 Heres a usb i like, flawless design, color that stands out, too bad it can break and doesnt work aswell as N sopose too.

..

38708104 I bought the D-Link - Xtreme N Wireless-N Gigabit Router and was not satisfied with a wall connection though the electrical outlet.. But I bought this and, well, i was blown away with its speed. The dual band part helps a lot when someones playing a game, and someone is just web browsing. It took me about 3-5 min to set it up. You can download faster with this.

..

38708104 Easy to install, just switched from linksys and the difference is outstanding. Works great!

..

38708104 whilst signal strength is good and performance also good "when it is connected", I find the product disconnects too often (compared for example with the wirelss N adapter built into my macbook; which does not disconnect at all when running on the same network!).
on my desktop I am running multiple separate user profiles and switching between profiles (annoyingly) drops the WLAN connection to the router. My previous wirelss-G adapter never did this. Also, when the connection drops, it takes some time trying to re-connect to the network.
Would definitely recommend thinking twice before buying this adapter. I certainly wouldn't purchase it again.

..

38708104 I got it on clearance sale. I have a similar one from D-link and I use it daily. The set up is a bit complicated and requires some research. It takes okay pictures, but unfortunately, it doesn't capture any videos. And, there is no night vision. Other than that, it is a decent camera for the price I paid.

..

38708104 I got this on clearance for $20 and it was worth every penny. I would have picked up more if they had been in stock.

..

38708104 The camera was pretty simple and easy to setup. It is useless when it's a bit dark, all you see is pitch black; only use this camera in a lighted area.

..

38708104 I like the product and has added to the security of our home.

..

38708104 I bought this camera for remote viewing and it works great, but I exchanged it for the next model which included that feature.

..

38708104 The camera is useful during the day only. You need to use a light during the night, or get the more expensive camera. Only issue I can complain about is how many times we have to reset it up. It. The power goes off, if the network glitches from a storm you have to reset everything up again.

..

38708104 Good camera for the price , average picture quality, but seams to be working just fine.

..

38708104 It's a great surveillance camera, to keep your house safe.

..

38708104 I bought this camera to keep an eye on my three dogs when we are not home. I wanted to see which one was the culprit at getting in to things. It does have an easy set up (though first one I purchased was defective) and you can monitor with a PC, Iphone or Android phone which is great. It works great when it works, it tends to go offline all the time and you can not fix that remotely you have to run the setup wizard to get back online. I would recommend the camera as long as the buyer was aware of it's issues.

..

38708104 I am very happy with this for a first time camera. I am able to capture every image that I want.

..

38708104 I received it very quickly from pcrush. It did not work it would buzz really loudly and not feed any paper. Pcrush is a 3rd party seller and it took awhile for the warranty registration to be updated on the dell site. Mine had a rapid exchange warranty which is nice however the exchange that was sent was a refurbished unit. It looks brand new and works great and for the price paid it was a steal. Still only four stars since the one received was junk.

Control up to 4 A/V components with this DISH Network DISH211 universal remote that features IR and UHF operation for flexible use. Backlit active mode keys provide a highly visible design and provide one-touch control.


..

38708104 Bought a couple when on sale at a better price than through Dish. (two for the price of one) Seems to be the same remote as supplied by Dish and works just fine with my VIP722k.
I can lose this remote just the same as the one I lost and replaced. Glad I bought two.

..

38708104 This is a good replacement remote for your Dish receivers. Was able to program it without any problems.

..

38708104 We had worn the old remote out. Took me about 3 minutes to set this one up and we were back in business.

..

38708104 It works great with our TV. Wasn't to bad getting it to sync.

..

38708104 It is a very reasonable remote and works fine. You need a code for your TV so the remote will work. The people at Dish can help you with that. This remote is exactly like Dish's one, and maybe even better and it is available in the store.

..

38708104 Very good product
Easy to setup
Easy to use on all brands of equipment

..

38708104 Works just like the original remote. Easy to program. I like it so much I bought two.

..

38708104 All good, better than original and had good instructions.
It would be better with lighted controls.

..

38708104 Best remote. Very easy to use. And also works with tv dish receiver, dvd and more. Very handy and got it at a very cheap price at best buy. I highly recommend this remote to all

..

38708104 We have several dish systems in the house and a few dogs to. When one of the dogs chews up the remotes, we can easily get another to work just as designed.

Griffin Survivor iPad Case - iPad - Black - Silicone, Polycarbonate


..

38708104 I am very pleased with this case. No issues with it so far and it does as intended, which is protect my ipad. Stylsh color as well.

..

38708104 Really bulky, camera lens was cover at all times, bought another cover.

..

38708104 I think the product does what it is meant to do, though I haven't dropped or wet my iPad yet. The clip is relatively easy to come off and I already lost it. Also it is rather difficult to open the clip into standing position.

..

38708104 Works great got a great price very happy! Survived a vacation in the car over 5000 miles

..

38708104 Overall, i'm happy with the purchase, the case it tough, easy to hold, protects the ipad well enough, but the fit isn't perfect. When snapping the device in, one corner of the case wouldn't completely latch on, leaving a bit of give when you apply pressure. If dropped specifically in this spot, the give my lead to damage, but overall its very secure. If you don't mind it not being a perfect fit, for the price, it does the job.

..

38708104 I would definitely recommend this case to a friend. It's durable and long lasting.

..

38708104 Very good product if your looking for a strong way to protect an expensive investment and extend the lifespan of the ipad. It is easy to assemble and provides good strong cover that enables the ipad to be taken almost anywhere with minimal risk to damaging the product. Very good investmetn from a company that makes some of the best protective cases for the iphone.

..

38708104 I liked the looks of this product but it did not fit into the purse I carry my I pad in.

..

38708104 Protects the ipad very well especially from messy kids hands. Just wipe it off and is like new. Also protects from falls. Feels sturdy enough to absorb shocks but is comfortable to hold onto

..

38708104 After my kids dropped our 4th generation iPad onto our hard tile floors for the 3rd time in 14 months (each time meant a new screen...thank goodness I had a protection plan) I finally decided to get some protection. This unit appealed to my younger girls (pink) and to me because of its Military Grade Rating. Still not water proof...but water resistant. Shock durability was a big plus for me. I made a video review of this item. Check it out. Although this product wasn't as rigid as I hoped, it does seem to offer solid protection. Recommend.

Charge or sync your iPad, iPhone, or iPod with more freedom to move around.Our USB-to-Dock-Connector cable is almost 10 feet long and built with heavy-duty 20-gauge conductors to handle the 10 watt power needs of Apple's iPad. Connect this cable to your computer's USB port to sync your iPad, iPod, or iPhone; or to any 10 watt USB power source (we suggest our own PowerBlock or PowerJolt) and charge from 10 feet away.


..

38708104 I bought 1 unit a year ago in Best Buy, but cant find it any more on stores (or cant buy it in Brazil for shipping to a Best Buy store (to be collected during a travel). Like too much this cable that would buy another 2 or 3 units, if I found them....

..

38708104 This is a terrible cable. Doesn't matter what it is connected: iPad 2, iPhone 4s, iPod...it either won't seat correctly or it will but only for a short time. Taking it back to the store ASAP.
My recommendation? Don't waste your money on this cable.

..

38708104 Only long cable I found heavy duty enough to carry the full 10 watts needed to charge an iPad. Standard USB extenders will not do it. The adapter end is very thick and well made; fine for the iPad and its various cases. I do have a problem charging my iPhone; the adapter end is too thick to snugly plug into the iPhone with the current case that I'm using.

HP X4000b Bluetooth Mouse - Wireless - Bluetooth - 1600 dpi


..

38708104 I really like this mouse, the bluetooth option to connect is great not having to have a usb dongle plugged in all the time

..

38708104 Works as advertised. Needed a mouse for my tablet and this does the trick.

..

38708104 This is my first bluetooth mouse, and for most similar mice, the user reviews complain about dropped connections happening on a regular basis - and accepted as just the price you pay for saving a USB port.
Well this mouse paired up with my laptop with no problem and I have seen not a single dropped connection in about 3 weeks of use. Laptop is a Macbook, running Windows 7 mostly.
Battery life: can't really comment yet - I haven't had to change batteries. But I do tend to switch off the power when I'm not using it, as I do with all non-wired mice. When switching back on, it connects back up again in under a second.
Comfort: I think I have average size adult male hands, but I find many mice too small and give me hand cramp. Not this one, good size and shape.

..

38708104 I used this with my bluetooth keyboard and my Samsung Pro Tab and was pleasantly surprised. More convenient than a laptop.

..

38708104 Handles well and feels great to the fingers! Easy to connect via bluetooth. Awesome purchase!

..

38708104 PERFECT FOR THE JOB.
IT GETS THE JOB DONE WITH EASE

..

38708104 I bought this out of necessity, but happened to be 50% off which was a great price.

..

38708104 Great bluetooth mouse, it paired quickly, worked on almost any surface and can be used with either hand. Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a bluetooth mouse.

..

38708104 This mouse is great for connecting to a tablet that does not have a USB port. It integrates smoothly and works perfectly with my venue 8.

..

38708104 I bought this mouse after looking at various bluetooth mice from other brands which were way too expensive. This was not only affordable, was really easy to setup on my Mac and works great and runs smoothly.

..

38708104 I purchased this printer to replace a older one. Took it out of the box and the power cord and ink cartridge were missing. Ended up returning it to the store. For the price it seemed like a decent printer.

..

38708104 It prints and I'm not running out of ink after 10 printed pages. XL HP cartridge is a winner.

..

38708104 Great little printer. Works better than the $400 one in my office at work. Would buy again.

..

38708104 The software is easy to use. The wireless functionality is convenient. I haven't had any ink issues yet.

..

38708104 For the price, the printer is of good quality and reliable. The only issues experienced with the printer are ones similar to ones had with other HP printers, such as constant waste of paper and ink with alignments, ink cartridge replacements, etc.

..

38708104 great value for price. lightweight, easy to move from room to room.

..

38708104 A good printer for the price. The software cd to set it up was blank but customer service quickly set it up for me online.

..

38708104 Printer prints well at a good speed. Love the wireless capability. Prints quickly. Good color.

..

38708104 Great product for the price ($40) during Thanksgiving sale. The only problem is I hear a scratching noise when the scanner is working at a specific point. Other than that, its a great product!

..

38708104 I bought this because I needed something for my home office, however upon arrival, it wont connect wirelessly to my computer meaning I have to constantly have it connected via USB. Besides that, it prints well, good colour and all.

The slim-yet-sturdy iPad Smart Case protects your iPad screen and its aluminum back. So your iPad is fully covered on all sides. And colorful too.


..

38708104 Apple had a real chance to make something that would perfectly fit their own product and somewhere along the way they fell short.
The backing on the case looks like it would be padded in some way but don't be fooled it offers nothing in the way of damage prevention.
The edges that surround the case create an unneccesarily large lip that become extremely uncomfortable when using for extended periods of time. Why they didn't create a smooth contour like just about every other case on the market is a real head scratcher.
The biggest oversight is the lack of a simple row of magnets across the back edge of the case so that you could flip over the Smart Cover and have it attach securely and not flop around. With all the "magnet technology" in the iPad itself and how it functions with the Smart Cover why wouldn't they stay on par with Belkin, Speck and several others?
Bottom Line: There are simply way better options out there for far less than the $50 Apple is asking for this product.

..

38708104 This ipad cover was by far the best purchase I could have made.

..

38708104 This case is awesome. We had the first case for over 2 years and was starting ti show wear and worn out so we decided to buy the same case. I would buy this again!

..

38708104 this is a great case if you don't have little kids and you are very carful handling expensive items of technology. Slim light weight and you don't have to power off your device just close the cover part of the case and puts your device to sleep and you can fold up in different positions for when you want to use it on a table.

..

38708104 Love this iPad cover! Looks nice and protects my iPad. Really love the dark gray color

..

38708104 what a great case for cases and its just in case.!

..

38708104 This is high quality product from Apple and you're going to pay a bit for the name brand (as usual). Not to take anything away from the case itself, because it's very nice, with a nice snug fit around the device, and the auto-lock function when you close the case. Because the weight of the iPad, though, when you try to stand it up on the folded over cover, it's a bit flimsy. Other than that, I would definitely recommend it.

..

38708104 Good product made with quality materials. Slim forms keeps in line with slim form of iPad. The magnetic portion holds well, but may scuff up iPad surface after long use.

..

38708104 This cover attaches to the iPad easily & closes snug against the iPad to protect the glass and put the iPad in sleep mode. I unfortunately spilled coffee on mine within the first week & it absorbed into the leather quickly. If you're prone to accidents like me you may want to go with the vinyl cover.

..

38708104 The case is reasonably priced and works as intended. It shuts off the iPad when closed and turns it back on when opening. Would recommend it.

..

38708104 This ipad cover was by far the best purchase I could have made.

..

38708104 This case is awesome. We had the first case for over 2 years and was starting ti show wear and worn out so we decided to buy the same case. I would buy this again!

..

38708104 this is a great case if you don't have little kids and you are very carful handling expensive items of technology. Slim light weight and you don't have to power off your device just close the cover part of the case and puts your device to sleep and you can fold up in different positions for when you want to use it on a table.

..

38708104 Love this iPad cover! Looks nice and protects my iPad. Really love the dark gray color

..

38708104 what a great case for cases and its just in case.!

..

38708104 This is high quality product from Apple and you're going to pay a bit for the name brand (as usual). Not to take anything away from the case itself, because it's very nice, with a nice snug fit around the device, and the auto-lock function when you close the case. Because the weight of the iPad, though, when you try to stand it up on the folded over cover, it's a bit flimsy. Other than that, I would definitely recommend it.

..

38708104 Good product made with quality materials. Slim forms keeps in line with slim form of iPad. The magnetic portion holds well, but may scuff up iPad surface after long use.

..

38708104 This cover attaches to the iPad easily & closes snug against the iPad to protect the glass and put the iPad in sleep mode. I unfortunately spilled coffee on mine within the first week & it absorbed into the leather quickly. If you're prone to accidents like me you may want to go with the vinyl cover.

..

38708104 The case is reasonably priced and works as intended. It shuts off the iPad when closed and turns it back on when opening. Would recommend it.

..

38708104 It provides good protection. It doesn't stay attached as well as I would like, but it works better than any other covers I have had

..

This Apple Smart Cover MD310LL/A features a polyurethane exterior with a microfiber lining to keep your iPad free of dust and protected against bumps and scratches. The aluminum hinge magnetically aligns the cover with the iPad for an ideal fit.

..

38708104 Apple had a real chance to make something that would perfectly fit their own product and somewhere along the way they fell short.
The backing on the case looks like it would be padded in some way but don't be fooled it offers nothing in the way of damage prevention.
The edges that surround the case create an unneccesarily large lip that become extremely uncomfortable when using for extended periods of time. Why they didn't create a smooth contour like just about every other case on the market is a real head scratcher.
The biggest oversight is the lack of a simple row of magnets across the back edge of the case so that you could flip over the Smart Cover and have it attach securely and not flop around. With all the "magnet technology" in the iPad itself and how it functions with the Smart Cover why wouldn't they stay on par with Belkin, Speck and several others?
Bottom Line: There are simply way better options out there for far less than the $50 Apple is asking for this product.

So much more than a case, the Smart Cover was designed alongside iPad 2 to be its perfect match: a thin, durable cover that magnetically aligns for a perfect fit. It automatically wakes and sleeps your iPad. It's a handy stand for reading, watching, and typing. Its microfiber lining keeps your iPad screen clean. And it's a way to make your iPad as personal on the outside as it is on the inside.

..

38708104 I thought this was the one!!
I have tiny ears, so finding an affordable bluetooth to use with my phone, that could also play music has been difficult.
The style of the earpiece makes it very comfortable, and the hook keeps it in place without trying to shove it in my ear. It's very lightweight and, once in place, you forget it's there.
I tested it on the first day ... sound quality on calls was great.
But when I tried to listen to a book from my phone, I could not get more than a few feet away without the sound cutting out. I've had other bluetooths that I'd forget where my phone was because I wandered away while talking or listening to music.
I could not leave the room with Jabra EasyGo. :(
My search continues

..

38708104 I work in a fast paced hectic environment, and I have damaged or lost several Blue Tooth ears b4. This unit works and sounds good, sets up in less than a minute with my LG phone, and I do not have to worry if I smash it or loose it while working because the price is low. Sound quality from both ends is above average, but not excellent. I find it very comfortable, even forgetting it is there after a while.

Enjoy crisp, bold sound with this 2-way speaker that features user-selectable EQ and a revoicing system to ensure precise audio reproduction.


..

38708104 Ive gotten so many compliments on sound paired with eon 18"sub WOW!!!!!!

..

38708104 I've waited 30 years to buy new speakers, and I'm glad I waited for these. Powered speakers have their own internal amp, and JBL utilizes some of the best. The sound is crisp and STRONG. We had a DJ who was drooling over these speakers at our last party, and I'd recommend them strongly.

JVC KS-U30 USB and Audio/Video Cable Adapter - Proprietary Connector - 1 x Male USB, 3 x RCA Male Audio/Video


..

38708104 I purchased the cable to run in my new JVC Double Dinn Player. easy plug in and play. Does exactly what is described that is does. Shipping was extremely fast from IT WHOLESALERS.
Great company to work with - Thank you

..

38708104 I had it installed in my van and instantly became a big fan of it! The audio was great and the fact that I could watch movies with it and things on the Internet is awesome. With this piece, my radio has a whole new life to it.

..

38708104 Did not play videos at at!...I think it needs a specific ipod o iphone

..

38708104 Overall, it is a fine idea. I would like to see in indash or plate mount to make it more accessible and clean. It does not seem to me like it does what it boasts. I can't fully control my Iphone with it nor see video. Unless I am doing something wrong, I think a simple USB would suffice. Only recommend if you like to see a still picture of the artist if it';s available.

..

38708104 I bought this cable to use in my Acura Integra. Install was easy. All I had to do was make sure the AV input was set to iPod and I was good to go. Only thing I would change would be to make it just a little bit longer, otherwise, it would get 5 stars.

..

38708104 I purchase the JVC KW-AV60BT stereo for my 2006 Toyota Pre-Runner Truck. The radio is excellent. I also purchased the optional cable to display videos from my iPhone. However, this cable did not work with my iPhone 4s. Could not get it to work at all (no audio or video). The radio would not recognize my iPhone. The radio would play my music from my iPhone when i pluged in my apple USB cable with no problem. I call JVC tech support and they said the the cable (JVC KS-U30) might be defective. They said that if the cable was working correctly, the radio would immediately recognize the iPhone as soon has it was pluged in. Sorry , but I did not have a good experience with this cable. I will return it back to Bestbuy...

..

38708104 I really like the form factor and the general performance of the Twist. It's very portable with a decent screen size (12.5" - 11" that some other convertibles have is too small for regular laptop work). I like Windows 8 and the metro start screen/tiles. I wish all my programs could be run without utilizing the desktop, but since I have older Windows programs it's very useful to be able to use them on a convertible machine. Overall very happy.

38708104 I bought this laptop because of the cool feature of turning into a tablet so I can watch movies on my flights for work. Well after doing one of the many suggested Windows and Lenovo's upgrades, I ended up losing access to my mini Hdmi port on my laptop. I looked up this issue online and Lenovo has this issue as a recorded issue with them at this time. Since I've owned this laptop for a few months, it has gone thru multiple factory settings restores and currently as I type this is back at Lenovo warranty department for repair work.

..

38708104 I had upgraded to the I7 core and 500 GB hard disk. I was working at my desk (not even plugged in, so no power surge) when the machine flickered and went black. I could not even get it to power back up (nor could the excellent people at the repair shop). Now I'm hoping they can recover my data. It was very nice while it was working, but what isn't.

Lexar 4GB Platinum II Memory Stick PRO Duo Card - 4 GB


..

38708104 I searched everywhere for this item from amazon to ebay, and this was the best "safe" deal I could find! I recently bought a psp for my younger brother and he needed a memory stick duo. I quickly found out that they're actually quite expensive. So I looked all over until I found this delicious little morsel!

..

38708104 I had a hard time finding this memory stick in local stores and when I did they were way overpriced, in my opinion. Then I found it on line and at a terrific low price. It works great, picture quality is comparable to the name brand. I'm very happy with my purchase.

..

38708104 Good price works great with psp ,enables games to be saved and played later ,also stores info .

Experience immersive visuals through these LG Cinema AG-F310 3D glasses that feature a lightweight design for comfort while you wear them. The cleaning cloth simplifies upkeep, and the storage pouch lets you tuck the glasses away for safekeeping.


..

38708104 These 3D glasses are great. I like the passive 3D system. The price is right (low), and they are comfortable for long term viewing

..

38708104 Straight out of the box and the kids will not use any other 3-D glasses

..

38708104 Not my favorite glasses, they feel pretty cheap. The ones at the theater may be better. Actually I think that the I max glasses are better.

..

38708104 These 3D Glasse Worked So Well With My Panasonic 3D Tv And These Are Built Better And Came With A Sleeve Case. Also The Glasses Are Very Comfortable. I'm A Very Satisfied Txvirgo.Another High Hitting Point Of Course Was The Amazing Price.

..

38708104 These were on closeout and I wish I could fine more.

..

38708104 I purchased these because the glasses that came with my passive 3d monitor weren't very comfortable. I have not been disappointed. There even seems to be less ghosting while using them than with my original pair.

..

38708104 great product, great price cant beat the price on these awesome glasses

..

38708104 Works well with tv and play station 3. Easy to wear and fit s over most glasses. Doesn't need batteries works just like theater glasses.

..

38708104 I was looking to get more 3D glasses for my LG 3D tv and found these at a great price. When using them i forget that I have them on since they aren't so heavy.

..

38708104 I use theses glasses every day for 2d too 3d conversion there just great cuz they don't feel like there even on your face there so light

..

38708104 I love the item and it helps us out getting all of our electronics connected to the internet

..

38708104 If you're a single person this is a great device, but if you have a large volume of data consumers I'd go with a dual band router.

..

38708104 While the range and operation of this router is fine, connecting it to the laptop was a chore. Unless you're tech savvy it takes a certain amount of intuition to complete the connection.

..

38708104 I bought this router back at the beginning of 2009 and its been great!
i have had it for almost five years! but now the connection s getting slow. but isntt it fear after five years!! but still although its technology is not "the latest" still worth buying!!
to make it short am buying it again! provided me with great connection for
my ps3 over the years :)

..

38708104 These routers are excellent. just plug and go..would buy another one

..

38708104 I bought the router at my son's urging...I went on line and picked it out and sent photo to him...H3 said.."Mom, buy it, is the same one I have....what a coincidence...

..

38708104 Though not an IT pro, I know several and so asked them for recommendations. They said this was "the DC3 of wireless routers" and still more than up to my limited needs: mostly email and web browsing (no gaming, streaming video, etc.). It's apparently been around for years and has a great rep --- was once the benchmark, I gather. Has therefore both the pros and cons of older tried&true products: Nothing new and fancy, but all the bugs are long since gone, it's simple to set up b/c it is pretty basic, tech support types tend to know it and know what to do when you call with questions, etc. On the other hand, it's not as fast and so forth as the newer stuff, will get only more obsolete sooner than the newer models, and so forth. In short, it works fine for me for now, just as my friends told me. And it should be OK for a good while longer, I figure.

..

38708104 I've been using this router in my home for years and it is still running as good as it was on day 1. It's not an N router, but that shouldn't make a big difference to most people. It is DD-WRT compatible. Great as a primary router or a secondary access point. I have mine in my basement and can get a good signal in my bedroom.

..

38708104 A good product for the home. The price was very good

..

38708104 I was a little concerned with the price compared to the last one I had. I was very surprised how much better it worked. Was defiantly worth the price.

Broad CompatibilityThe Linksys RE1000 works seamlessly with all b/g/n Wi-Fi devices so you can connect all of the computers and devices around your home. For best performance, pair with any Wireless-N router.Extended RangeBuilt with leading 802.11n wireless technology, the Linksys RE1000 provides reliable performance. Multiple MIMO (multiple input, multiple output) antennas extend your router's wireless coverage into hard-to-reach areas of your home.


..

38708104 I'm very disappointed with this router. I was having trouble with it since the first day. Their customer service is horrible! 1 year warranty is only on hardware. software is not covered. they told me the model I got needs software upgrade which is not covered! Mine goes to trash!!!!

..

38708104 My house is big enough that the signal was very weak upstairs when my wireless router was in the office on one side of the first floor. The signal was strong at the top of the steps outside the room where the router was, but as you went down the hall, the signal decreased. I searched online a little but I saw many mixed reviews and conflicting statements for what exactly I would need to extend my network. I wanted a simple, inexpensive solution, and i wanted to make sure it worked. I ended up just asking someone in the store. I explained the situation and the router I was working with and this is what they suggested.
The setup was a little harder than expected (I probably should have read the instructions first). It needs to be set up near the wireless router originally, and once it picks up the signal it can be unplugged and moved somewhere else. It will actually boost, and extend the network where ever it is placed.
It has a wall plug attached, which can be removed in favor of a cord, depending on where it will be placed.

..

38708104 Performs as stated. Works great on patio and porch.

..

38708104 This product does what it says, "Increases your network coverage" and thats about it. In my scenario it gave me the full signal in other parts of the house where I needed it but made the network very slow and unstable. My devices have better performance from less signal out of the main WiFi router than with the range extender. So the good is: you get a great signal but the bad: you lose performance. Makes the connected devices good for only light web browsing.

38708104 Installed in less than 10 minutes. Compatible with existing Wi Fi Router, Motorola SBG6580 with TWC. Have not experienced any signal drops. Just make sure you set up your existing router in a location that picks up the strongest signal, that way the expander will replicate a better signal. Both router & expander survived a recent thunderstorm & power outage, Thankfully!

..

38708104 I work in IT and have worked in this career field for over 20 years. I bought one of these a few years ago (802.1g model) and it didn't work then. I figured over the years they probably fixed the problems. The device is pretty easy to set up but you can't really make any changes unless you can connect the device to your current (linksys) router. If that router is secured it creates more problems.
When it's finally hooked up my computers close by would connect to it, But then it would drop connections, restart it self, take a long time to wake up, It was totally frustrating and not worth the money. I might pay $5 bucks for it but not $90.
Someone suggested to get a different brand so I'm going to try that one out.

..

38708104 It was very easy to set up. The only difficulty was that I didn't have all my windows updates installed, and I had to make sure that a specific one was done before installing this product. That installation took forever, but once that was done, the installation of the extender went extremely rapidly! The only very small issue was that I had to move the extender closer to my router in order to get the most bars of service. It now works like a charm! We have wireless service in the farthest reaches of our relatively large home. I highly recommend it.

..

38708104 I purchased this range extender along with a new dual band router to facilitate simultaneous video streaming from Netflix and online gaming. I was able to connect a network cable from the BluRay DVD player to this unit which then connects to the rest of the network wirelessly. It worked as advertised and really helped my network's performance.

..

38708104 My goal was to improve the wireless signal through out my home. My primary access point is on the second floor and I needed stronger coverage in the lower level (basement) to be able to use wireless devices there and on the exterior of the building. I wanted to stay with the same manufacture (Cisco, Linksys) and have simple set up and compatibility. The set up was a breeze and took less than 10 min from start to finish. It has improved signal at my access point in the lower level (approx.200ft) from poor to sometimes zero signal to 50-90%. Now I can maintain signal for Internet and printing.Great choice and did not cost a huge investment

..

38708104 After installing, re-installing and performing various adjustments, this product worsened all connections to my wi-fi network. My internet-enabled Blu-ray DVD player performed much worse with the Extender installed, dropping the connection during streamed video roughly once a minute and reducing video quality. And the overall range of the wi-fi network was reduced, not increased, and it was slower.
I was able to return this product to Best Buy for a full refund, which was the only good part of my experience with it.

..

38708104 the distortion happens at high to max volume and very horrible bass response and I`ve had mine for 1 year

..

38708104 I got these a long time ago, they're get-what-you-pay-for speakers. Don't expect the best quality from these. If you don't want fancy expensive speakers, these will do just fine. They do get some static backdrop sometimes, but this is a recent issue that didn't happen before. I would NOT recommend these to a sound artist/ musician. They work OKAY, but for a few dollars more you can have much better speakers.

..

38708104 theese are speakers. they are just speakers nothing else. they dont add extra such as bass. so the sound quality is terrible. also when you turn it up (max volume) the quality is terrible and it not that loud. also they are NOT clear. when you hear drums you hear a crackling noise.

the design is terrible. they barrley stand up by themselves. mainley because all the weight is in the back. also 1 speaker has the weight of a rock and the other one feels like foam. also the wires are power wire is to short.

overall they just do their jobs. nothing more. if you decide to get theese speakers i warned you. but if you want speakers get some HP speakers. http://bit.ly/kXfKW1

..

38708104 Don't buy them, I got these free with a keyboard that I got and they suck. I got them for FREE and I would never pay 12 bucks for them. Don't waste your money.

With 103 washable, laser-printed and UV-coated keys, this Logitech K310 920-004033 USB keyboard provides reliable durability for frequent use. The 12 shortcut hot keys and multimedia keys provide simple access to frequently used functions.


..

38708104 I ordered this keyboard on 11/29/13 with 2 day shipping, the item was in stock at IT Wholesalers. The keyboard arrived on 12/12/13 via USPS, well outside of a 2 day timeframe.
The keyboard had no documentation included with it, no warranty information, nothing. It was wrapped in bubble wrap loosely in a brown cardboard shipping box.
The vendor blacked out the serial number under the keyboard with a permanent black marker. As a result, I'm unable to register for the 3-year included warranty.
The keyboard itself is plug and play; there are icons underneath showing the cleaning procedure and tolerances of the keyboard. Keypress is quiet and soft, and responsive. No software is needed from Logitech. The FN key and included functions (volume, calculator, etc) are quick and responsive. Overall, the keyboard itself is very nice; but if you can buy it from someone other than IT Wholesalers, please do.

..

38708104 This is a nice inexpensive keyboard that is pretty durable and you don't have to worry about spills!
I use it with my laptop when I'm at home and not near my docking station. It's a great size for this purpose although not ergonomically designed.

..

38708104 Easy to setup and use (on Windows 7).
A chiclet kind feeling is great to have on a desktop keyboard.
Poured water on it and was functional after just shaking it to remove water from its surface.

..

38708104 what a cool little keyboard! I've been taking it with me on job sites as frequently as possible to get it dirty so I can clean it! got a deal at best buy... only $15. better price than most other physical and/or online stores. if you are in the market for a washable keyboard, give it a try... you can always return it after a few days if you dislike it.

..

38708104 No complaints with this keyboard. Great for my kid that eats at the computer. Easy clean up and set up.

..

38708104 The keyboard functions as advertised, resisting spills and being far easier to type on than most waterproof keyboards. Still, they keys felt a bit stiff and I found that the spacing was awkward for my fingers, resulting in more typos.
Ended it up abandoning it and going back to my laptop keyboard but highly recommend for desktop PCs for people who are clumsy and routinely ruin keyboards.

..

38708104 I needed a new keyboard and couldn't believe the price on this one. Easy to hook up and works great!

..

38708104 I can see the letters clearly even in low light. The online order and instore pick-up process was easy.

..

38708104 Just love it. Using it for coding and playing games.

..

38708104 Too many keyboards are all dark. I can see the letters clearly. Even in low light.

Ultrathin Keyboard Cover protects your keyboard in style and it's the perfect partner for your iPad. The stylish, ultra-thin aluminum screen cover feels great and looks even better. Instant on/off automatically wakes your iPad when you open the cover and sends it to sleep when you close it. When it's time to write an IM or email, you'll enjoy typing on the included Bluetooth wireless keyboard. The external keyboard not only frees up screen space on your iPad, it also allows you to work faster by using shortcuts for the commands you use most often, such as copy, paste, undo and many more. Battery life for the keyboard lasts six months on full charge. Securely attach the cover with its clever magnetic clip. Aligned with the magnets built into your iPad's frame, the clip draws tablets and cover irresistibly together. Cover works with iPad 2 and iPad (third generation) and includes the Bluetooth wireless keyboard, stand, USB to micro USB charging cable and cleaning cloth.


..

38708104 It is an alright keyboard, I guess the Ipad was not meant to have a keyboard, is hard to remember new commands and not having a mouse makes it a little hard to get used to.

..

38708104 Bought for my wife to use for her personal use. She loves the fact that she doesnt have to hold the ipad upright anymore while on the table.

..

38708104 Didn't fit new iPad Air. Exchanged. Got a different one.

..

38708104 i like that this is a slim cover as well as a great stand with the convenience of a keyboard. it is very easy to "take along" and put into bag without the bulk

..

38708104 I would recommend this set up to anyone. It is easy to use and does the job without any hassles

..

38708104 Only issue is there is no protection for ipad
When they are separated. Not a problem for some. I need something. Bought fabric skin
With rubber case instead.

..

38708104 Great keyboard really light. Easy to install and easy to used.

..

38708104 My family enjoys using this for things like e-mails and web forms.

..

38708104 It was easy to connect and portable, kinda like a cover for the face

..

38708104 I love this keyboard. Battery last a long time. Easy to attach and remove. Very easy to type on.

..

38708104 One of the thumb buttons broke (G6 button), weakens overtime. It is plastic so I guess it is expected. Logitech needs to strengthen these thumb buttons. Sucks because this was a common button that I used in everyday gaming.

..

38708104 Find out what is useful to you and program the buttons to make it easy! Copy and paste? Easy! Need a more complicated keystroke pattern? You can do that too! To monitor my site, I use keystroke navigation. Thanks again, Logitec!

..

38708104 I have the G500, G300, and now the G700 mouse (I purchased in that order over 2 years).
G500
PROS - good quality switches, good optical sensor
CONS - only 1 profile, poor software: terrible interface, game-recognizing mouse profiles did not work reliably and required inconvenient workarounds (manually editing XML files, ALT-tabbing in and out of games and restarting Logitech Set Point software )
G300 (my favorite of all 3)
PROS - great quality buttons and switches, 3 profiles with easily-identifiable color lights on the sides (not annoying), great software
CONS - low DPI optical sensor (it's sadly not a laser sensor)
G700
PROS - 5 profiles, several buttons, it can work wired OR wireless
CONS -
1) Very, very poor quality buttons and switches. I returned the first mouse I bought because several of the buttons didn't work or got stuck: G10 button, left/right scroll switches. Also, some of the buttons feel vague and provide no confidence to use rapidly.
2) Logitech Set Point software is terrible. With the last few revisions of the driver that gets saved to the mouse, the mouse would forget its profile settings after a few hours... while in use! The only solution right now it to use much older Set Point software with a horrible interface but at least the mouse is usable.
3) The included micro USB cable is way too heavy to use. I am using a much lighter one that I got with an external HDD.

..

38708104 Ergonomics on this mouse are only so-so -- otherwise this is a great mouse at a good price.

..

38708104 Well to start off I come from the experience of using the previous version call the Logitech G7.
The main changes are:
- Single rechargeable battery
- can be run wireless and wired
- mouse wheel can run in 2 modes
- 6 additional buttons
- more durable, non-slip surface
- can be run more than a full day's work on the power saver setting
Cons:
- battery meter display is not accurate
- cable to run wired and charge the mouse is stiff
- many of extra buttons are not standardized so you need to manually set each button within the mouse software

..

38708104 This product is easy to install and well worth the price.

..

38708104 This mouse is a good mouse for its price. I am excited to use it but one complaint will be the software that is downloaded to be able to assign keys. it is not as easy friendly as i was hoping for like razor products. battery life lasts about a day. shorter if continuos use. but button placement is great. Can easily access them wothout much delay. Overall, satisfied with the product.

..

38708104 This mouse is really good for gaming, but you still need to charge it a lot.

..

38708104 This is my second G700 mouse. My mice get a lot of use. The G700 fits well in my hand. It is a bit smaller than the MX Revoolution that I had been using. The smaller size fits my hand better and makes it feel as if I have more control. Both left and right sides of the G700 have a nice well textured rubber grip to them that prevents slipping. Buttons are all well within reach of my fingers without having to reposition my hand. This is certainly a good thing while gaming. Tracking is superb and is scalable through the software, and through the buttons located on the mouse. The buttons are programmable to do what you need them to do. Logitech has added support and preprogrammed functions for the most popular games.
One feature I like a lot is the ability to use this mouse either as a corded or cordless config. Honestly I never liked corded mice. I hated the cord getting tugged and having to yank on the mouse to free the cord. Some people say that cordless mice suffer from comm lag and that can mean the difference between being alive or dead in a game. I have never seemed to notice one way or the other. Since the first purchase of my first G700 I have oddly always went corded, but it is nice to know that if I forget my cord when I go somewhere I can always use it cordless.
You really cannot go wrong buying this mouse.

..

38708104 I gave this a 3 Star with the only thing driving the rating down being an apparent quality issue with the primary click buttons. I am writing this review after going through a second G700. The first lasted 6 months and the second 4 months.
What happens is the primary left click button does not stay engaged reliably when pressed. Thus, if you are trying to click drag, the button will disengage and re-engage while you are holding it down. You can search the web for G700 button problem and find a farily lengthy thread with many people experiencing this problem.
Now beyond that ... it is hands down the best mouse I ever used. The 4 side button design is awsome and most importantly those buttons are easy to use. The buttons on the top are laid out perfect and shaped such that its easy to find the buttons you want. I really loved this mouse and Logitech is sending me replacements for both of my defective ones so Kudo's to them for that. But I can't buy another one of these unless I see them acknowledge the issue and report its fixed. Sigh ... I really loved this mouse.

Play music on the go with this Logitech UE wireless speaker that features 2 full-range drivers that deliver pure and rich sound. A built-in microphone lets you make hands-free phone calls using a Bluetooth-enabled device.


..

38708104 I was looking for a small portable speaker for play out in the yard and to take on trips. The Logitech - UE Mobile Boombox is perfect, nice deep bass, clean full sound, not flat sounding like others I have tried. Bluetooth range is very good, it started skipping on me at 50 feet.
YES the dimensions in the specifications are wrong... 2.5"H x 2.5"D x 4.5"W is what I measured

..

38708104 Easy to use-love that you can sync more than one device-small and durable with great sound. Couldn't be happier especially since I didn't have to spend a fortune to get quality.

..

38708104 Small. Powerful. Simple. Unless you need really big sound this is great for backyard and anywhere you need some music. Great value and well built.

..

38708104 I like the little square thing. The Ue 984 sound great and I have gotten it for my wife. When she is in the spare bedroom it is loud and clear. I can hear it down stairs and understand the lyrics. I went to Best buy to find a Bluetooth speaker small enough to fit in her small purse. I have the JBL charge and my opinion it's the best one at best buy. So I had the chance to test all of the Bluetooth by pairing them up with my smart phone. I decided to get the UE 984 Logitech because of it size, sound,10 hour battery life, and it was the only one in its price range that outperformed with max volume and clarity.

..

38708104 I started looking for a Bluetooth speaker after looking at the Jambox. I could believe the sound coming out of that little box. The next day i started looking at reviews on line and at YouTube. This little unit kept popping up in most of the top 5 players. To me sound quality and volume were the biggest things to look at and then i saw a YouTube video of the UE and realized that portability is also a key factor. this player though it plays loud and clear is not the loudest and doesn't have the top bass, but it sounds great and has a good balanced sound with bass and treble. The UE is loud enough for small to medium rooms and i was able to get a good 60 foot line of sight signal without drops !! that's important to me.
Its not Bose or Sonos but it is amazing and great for camping, fishing, hiking or just hanging around the house. easy to use and easy to carry. I can charge it with my android phone charger, don't even need the charger that came with it.

..

38708104 I bought this speaker online based on the specifications about a month ago and Best Buy still has not corrected the ad. I was surprised when I went to pick it up. This speaker is no where near the size advertised. The ad says Height: 8 inches, Width: 15 inches and Depth: 4 inches. Wrong. This speaker is about 4 inches wide 3 inches high and 5 inches deep. Best Buy credited my account for a refund except they charged me $10 and said the promotional $10 gift card had already been sent. I'm amazed they are still advertising the incorrect size.

..

38708104 I purchased this for my husband this Christmas. I read all the reviews and found more recommendations for this one. They were right. It never breaks up, is highly portable and can have multiple users...and sounds great. Long battery life too.

..

38708104 I searched all around my local Best Buy Store because I thought it was much bigger than it was. When I finally asked a sales associate, and was pointed in the right direction, I was shocked. It's very small! I was skeptical of the quality to say the least.
When I got it home, and unboxed it, I was playing music in less than 5 minutes! Set up is a breeze.
It has great range, and bass for such a small device. It sounds great!
It's not going to sound as good as a $500 Bose unit, but as someone who has owned several iHomes and other players over the years, this has to be at the top!
The Bluetooth functionality makes it easy to use without having to dock my iPhone. I bought this for my office, but I could easily see myself bring it on business trips or to the beach.

..

38708104 This little speaker is great. The sound is really fantastic and the setup with an iphone was as simple as it should be. There is no reason to spend more on the other mini speakers. After giving them a pretty good in store comparision the Logitech won and when I got it home without all the store background noise it was even better than I thought it would be. Don't spend $150 or more on another competing or "cooler" brand name speaker, this Logitech easily beats them all in the under $200 range.

..

38708104 Maybe mine is an abberation, or maybe it shows a lack of quality control at Logitech, but I bought my speaker yesterday after hearing one that sounded just fine. When I tested mine (with two bluetooth devices of my own, and two of others) the sound had very unacceptable distortion, even at moderate and low sound levels.
I can't imagine that this is typically the case, but now I'm spooked away from replacing the one I bought with another. Returned for refund, and very disappointed. A defective product shouldn't ever leave the factory if quality assurance is what it should be.
It should be noted that a significant Best Buy competitor has discontinued this very popular product. Coincidence?

38708104 I like the mouse and really enjoying to use it while I am at work. I never had any issues with this. I am planning to buy the same to my wife so that she never feel jealous of my mouse. ;)

..

38708104 Device is easy to use. I have used other Logitech mice before and this one is one of my favorite. It is very portable and connects with all devices I have tried so far without any install on the computer I am using. Really love this device.

..

38708104 The Logitech mouse is your standard mouse. I just like the Logitech devices. They work well.

..

38708104 I have bought several wireless mouse(s). This one is a little small, however I like that the battery life is longer because it goes into sleep mode when not in use.

..

38708104 Bought it for the laptop. Best price. Like the color. Easy to use.

..

38708104 Just plug it in and in about a minute you are using it. Love how it works on multiple surfaces.

..

38708104 I wanted a small stylist mouse and this worked perfectly.

38708104 I have 3 of these one for every computer it is nice not to have strings. This mouse is fast and easy to use.

..

38708104 Love this mouse. this is the second one that I have bought

..

38708104 This mouse is very good for the price. I purchased it on sale, but would have bought it at regular price.

..

38708104 good value. works great. Would buy again. enjoy it.

..

38708104 it seems I had to move it around too much and all over the desk

..

38708104 good for the price will see how it holds uo with time

..

38708104 I got this mouse for a 19 year old nephew who wanted something other than the laptop trackpad. He loves it. It works great, has a tough build quality and was very easy to set up on Windows 7. The battery life is great and it helps that the mouse has a on/off switch that is somewhat recessed so that it cannot accidentally get turned on/off.
For users a bit older or with large hands, this mouse may be a bit on the teeny side but I still found that it was easy to control and move.
This is a great beginner mouse for young ones for the price!

..

38708104 Wouldn't recommend to anyone who plans on using this mouse for any other purpose than internet browsing. Wouldn't even recommend it in this case scenario considering the price isn't worth the quality. Spend your money on any other mouse besides this one.

..

38708104 The keyboard and mouse worked great for about a year until the rubber wheel of the mouse fell apart. I have never had a mouse wheel fall apart. Now both keyboard and mouse have to be replaced. Tried replacing just the mouse with the same model type but no joy. Microsoft quality control needs some work

..

38708104 Good and comfortable keyboard with full size mouse.

..

38708104 I loved it, everything about it. It doesn't work with my Samsung TV so I'll use it for my home computer instead. I've been using Microsoft ergo keyboards since 1995.
I'd like to see it with a small solar panel to recharge the keyboard, but that the only improvement I can think of.
A sold 5 out of 5 stars.

..

38708104 I needed an ergonomic keyboard I could carry with me since laptop keyboards are too small and cause my wrists to hurt. This one isn't the best ergo keyboard in the world, but it's relatively compact which makes it ideal for travel.
I learned that I needed to take the batteries out of it whenever it goes into the backpack because apparently it still tries to send key-presses to the laptop, even when the bluetooth USB is not plugged into the machine. Batteries didn't last long installed in the keyboard while in the confines of the laptop bag.

..

38708104 Love this keyboard this is my second one!! I have one at work and one at home, very comfortable!!

..

38708104 I got this so I could work from a recliner on my big screen tv
the receiver would not pick up the keyboard on the back of the tower so i had to use a USB extension to get it ti work reliably.
the mouse scroll is almost useless on flash apps
If i didn't want to get rid of the cords i would go back to my corded mouse and keyboard.

..

38708104 This was a replacement of my Logitech wireless that stopped working. It's a bit pricy, but its working

..

38708104 Keyboard has lots of "bells & whistles", which are useless if you are not a power computer user.

..

38708104 I replaced an old wireless mouse/keyboard that constantly lost the signal or just didn't perform well. So far, this combo set has worked flawlessly.

..

38708104 It's very convenient to use the desktop now. I truly enjoy the "wireless" concept.

38708104 Since it's part of Best Buy I'd prefer to pay for the item at the store this way I get a receipt and not a packing slip, if something should wrong with the item I should be able to bring the item to any Best Buy store with receipt this way they can take care of an exchange then they can email us when the new item has arrived.
If you need the new battery it should only cost around 9 dollars some stores are charging 35 dollars even above retail suggestive price

POOR QUALITY BUILD/MATERIALS.
