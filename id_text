39926603 I bought a Refurbished Dell Laptop from MPC Deals aka Metro Business Systems aka metropc.com on the Best Buy Marketplace. The laptop they sent me was not even close to the one i ordered. Took almost 3 weeks to get the replacement. The replacement Laptop did not function at all, it was actually visibly missing critical parts! Couldnt even turn it on. almost 2 weeks later i finally got a refund. Over 1 month. Hours on the phone with them. No laptop. At least i got my money back eventually.

Simplify the use of your tablet with this Asus docking station that features a keyboard for easy typing. The docking station's lithium-ion battery provides up to 15 hours of extended battery life for long-lasting use of your tablet.


..

39926603 Already liked my tablet - now I love it! The extended battery life is a huge plus.

..

39926603 I bought this for my wife to be like a netbook. I couldn't ask for anything more! I bought an external HD so we can load up pictures an movies onto the tablet. The dock makes the tablet more useful and should be a nessecity! I got this on sale and the red is a perfect color!

..

39926603 This is a nice little docking station for the Asus TF300T. It preforms great an makes it easier to use the tablet. The only catch is the battery life of he dock does not mirror the tablet an if you have to use it for more then 3 to 4 hours you will have to charge it an un dock the tablet an use it with out the keyboard. But that is the only problem I see, my wife loves it an does not complain. So as long as she is happy I am as well. So in my eyes cause she is happy this product preforms as advertised. I would recommended it to anyone with the TF300T Model.

..

39926603 This product was a great fit for our new tablet, matching color and increasing battery life and it makes tablet more versatile.

..

39926603 The mouse pad is really touchy and I haven't figured a way to adjust it, thus 4 stars. It makes a tablet a little more productive , not just a surfing tool.

..

39926603 This product is great for not just home-office but as well as a day-to-day use.
This is a great thing to have when writing a pa[er or report on your tablet. its easy and portable and i love this.

..

39926603 Bought a new keyboard based on recommendation of Asus service technician. It did not help me resolve my problem with tablet.
Now have two keyboards and a useless tablet.

..

39926603 Have a keyboard is one thing, but triplin the battery life is awesome!

..

39926603 I have use this mainly for work.(emails and notes for work) The keyboard docking station has added even more battery life to my TF300T. Sometime you just need a physical keyboard to get the job done. I have used this for over a month and no problems. Everything on the keyboard docking station works. (Card reader and usb port). I added an sd card to it, for even more storage. Basically its now a netbook. Works great!

..

39926603 This keyboard works great with my Asus tablet. It attaches and detaches very easily, and works very well when attached. I also got it for a great price thanks to Deal of the Day. I don't think I'm getting close to an extra 15 hours of battery life, but I'm still happy with it and would recommend it.

39926603 This tablet's touch screen either does not work, or randomly does it's own thing (opens apps on its own, types things on it's own) on a frequent basis. This tablet has been well cared for, always in a case/screen protector, and never dropped. I sent it in to Asus twice just before the warranty expired. The first time I got it back from them, they said nothing was wrong with it. The second time, they apparently replaced the touch screen. Within a week of getting it back, I was having all the same problems again, but because I was in the process of moving to another state, I couldn't do anything about it then. I cannot get it fixed because I am now out of warranty. I will never purchase an Asus product again! The product and the warranty service are both useless. My brother bought a Samsung Galaxy Note Tablet that I use when the Asus is giving me fits, and I love it. I will be Purchasing one of those very soon.

..

39926603 I bought this tablet with great excitement for my husband for our anniversary. He has wanted this for a long time but we could not afford a new one. I saw this one refurbished and jumped at the chance. Received it quickly and wrapped it up. My husband was thrilled... until we found that the touch screen did not work properly and despite a 24 hour charge, the tablet showed no power. I immediately wrote to seller, nothing, wrote again.... nothing.... again and got an auto out of office response.... again and was directed to another person. She gave me permission to send it back however I was told I needed to wait for UPS to send me a mailing label. I used my Best Buy Credit card so time was of the essence as I don't wait to be charged interest on something that never worked. A full 3 weeks later I received a return label. I immediately packaged and brought to the UPS store. Today I received an email it was received and my refund is to be processed in 2-3 days.... I will tell you I found the same tablet at Tiger Direct for a few dollars more... it's fantastic and working. I would never do business with this seller again.

39926603 I purchased this tablet over a year ago. From day one I noticed that I will get a lot of errors when launching apps it wills say app is not responding and ask to close it. At the beginning I thought I could be a hardware/app problem not the tablet itself. However as of today it keeps closing apps unexpectedly. After 4-6 months after I purchased I started noticing that the battery will deplete the battery even if turned off a day after full charge. I normally do not play games or handle large apps that will require charger to be plugged at all times. I contacted Asus and send back my tablet for repairs. They complete their repair, however after a year the tablet seems not to be able to handle apps because I will always get the not responding warning I get frustrated and put back my tablet. The tablet is rarely used and its on original conditions, rarely use it due to low performance. I tried to trade off my Asus tablet for a different tablet and brand, but the tradeoff was only for $89 when I paid almost $700 for the tablet and keyboard combo. Not acceptable. Now I am stocked with a like new tablet which cannot performs any task. I once, wanted to purchase an Asus laptop, however, after this experience and the low quality for high price items. I will never go back to Asus. I hope we all collectively sue Asus for their low performance products or be able to get my money back for their not working products. Very disappointed

39926603 The ASUS Tranformer Infinity pad is easy to use. It comes with 32GB of internal memory and storage, but you can use SD Cards as well. I have used many tablets and by far this is the best one that I have used. This tablet is easy for beginners and advanced users to use.

..

39926603 I purchased an ASUS tablet just over a year ago. I loved it, I got the keyboard and they have been a great combination for me. I use it primarily to access my work desktop and to read technical documents when I travel. In August it just refused to power on. Just before this, it started getting slow about powering on, I would have to hit the button several times. The green light would come on showing it was charging, but that was all it would do, even after several resets. I contacted ASUS online, had a very efficient conversation and got it RMA'd, it took a while, but I got it back working for just the shipping. Now, 5 months later it is doing the same thing, and now out of warranty. I loved it, but that is too much money to spend for a device that barely lasts over a year.

..

39926603 I purchase an Asus tablet less than a year ago. Within 2 months I had to send it back for repairs. That cost me $25. It has been one issue after another. The tablet freezes up. Apps suddenly disappear and have to be reinstalled. Recently, it kept rebooting and fortunately I was able to do a factory reset in between reboots. Now, only a week later, I can no longer charge the tablet with the power chord. I have to connect it to the dock. Interestingly, the power chord WILL charge the dock.
I called Customer Service 8 times in 2 days. Got disconnected from Chat 3 times and in the end NO ONE knows what the problem is. In the end I was told to send the tablet to Asus for repair. Not happening when it will cost at least another $25! My tablet should have been THOROUGHLY checked out when it was in for repair the first time. Obviously, it wasn't.
I might add, I am not the only customer having these problems. I have found numerous complaints online along with numerous poor reviews.

..

39926603 This is our first tablet. We are on our 2nd Asus due to the first one dying suddenly after 364 days. Yes we were saved by the last day of our warranty period. Best Buy gave us a brand new Asus replacement with not questions asked. We use this mainly to check emails and to read the daily newspaper and occasional book. Our grandkids take it over on their visits. We always end up with new game apps when they leave. This tablet worked flawlessly until Jan 2nd of this year. It would not power on. The night before our grand kids had used it all night long and I think that was the reason for the sudden death. We are very happy with the way it works and what it does.

..

39926603 Screen will jump around with in a year. Is a known issue and ASUS will not replace. I've gone through 2 ASUS tablets TF300 and TF700. They both lasted about 1 year and then went bonkers. Warranty will not replace.. JUNK JUNK JUNK..

..

39926603 Bought last spring. Seemed okay at first, but slowly began running sluggish and laggy. My smartphone performed the same tasks much faster. I finally got disgusted enough to send it in to ASUS service and it was gone for 6 weeks. Got it back and it was no better. They said they tested it and it was okay. I put up with it for a few weeks, but my wife's ipad 2 and even my three daughters' Samsungs were smoother and quicker. So I sent it in again. This time I got it back in about 2 weeks, but again they said they tested it and it was 'okay'. However, this time I noticed a small dent next to the charge port that was not there before. I reported it to ASUS and they had me take a picture and email it to them. I did so, they assigned my a case number and an RMA number and I sent it back to them yesterday. They sent me a prepaid label for FedEx, which was nice, but I had to drive to the FedEx store which is 30 minutes away. The label could not be scanned properly by a FedEx driver. What a hassle. I almost bought the higher end Samsung tablet. Wish I had. My sister in law has one and it performs very well, smoother than my wife's ipad 2.

..

39926603 I decided to get a tablet after my laptop was reaching the end of it's life. After debating between an iPad, Windows, or Android tablet, I decided on this Asus pad because the reviews had it as a top Android Tablet.
After using the tablet for a couple weeks, I realized how underwhelming the device was. Aside from most of the Android apps being just stretched phone apps, the device was not running well. Apps would freeze, the device would lock up, and eventually it would reset and reboot itself because it would freeze so badly. For some reason, the Wifi would not work correctly either. Every other device in my home gets at least 20MBPS through Wifi, and this tablet was consistently getting less than 1. I'm sure this caused some of the lagging. Everything with the device seemed to not work. I even had issues with the clocks on the device not matching. The one on the dash would say 1:43 and the one in the corner would say 9:57.
After contacting Asus, they told me to ship the device back and they would fix it. After about a month with them, they sent it back to me and claim they had to replace the motherboard in the device. At first, it seemed to be better, but now after about 2 weeks the device is back to its old ways. I have tried factory resets, uninstalling apps, and removing widgets, but nothing has worked. This is an unreliable tablet and I highly suggest not purchasing it. The fact that Asus repaired it and it still functions poorly makes me believe that it is the product, and not just this one I have. I only wish I could return it for an iPad.
Be warned. I'm not an Apple person (only product I own is an iPod) but I can honestly say Android tablets have not won me over.

..

39926603 Here are the facts:
- initially, I was thrilled with the tablet. Great display, easy to set up, great to watch shows and movies on, check email, read magazines through google play... The docking station with keyboard made typing reallyeasy. All in all, a lovely device.
- except for the sound quality, which is terrible. You will need speakers or headphones to watch anything.
- however, it had a technical failure of the micro-HDMI port after less than 7 months of use.
- when I went to Best Buy's Geek Squad, after 30-40 minutes waiting in line, they were unable to help me. They told me I had to contact Asus directly. The existence of the Geek Squad was one of the selling points for me to buy the device, knowing that I could speak to someone in person and have issues resolved quickly (Best Buy's response to the Genius Bar, I thought...).
- it took me almost a whole day to deal with Asus customer service and send the device. I had to go on what Asus calls "live chat", where you discuss your issues with a customer service representative via an instance messenger service. They were helpful enough - I got all the necessary information about how to send the device to be inspected and repaired.
- but then I had to go to a USPS (Fedex or UPS would have worked too) and mail it. It cost me $15 to ship to Grapevine TX.
- the package arrived 3 weeks ago according to USPS tracking and has not been entered into the Asus tracking system. In other words Asus lost the device.
- another Live Chat with customer service yielded no answers and I was given no definitive timeline for when I would receive information.
I think the facts speak for themselves: faulty device, misleading marketing (leading me to believe issues could be resolved by the Geek Squad), slow and cumbersome customer service, poor follow-up and lack of responsiveness. So despite the fact that during those 7 months I had the device, it was great and I loved it, the past month of schlepping and waiting and getting on live chats has sort put a dent in my appreciation of the device.
To put this into perspective, I have had a Macbook since Nov 2008, and every time I have had a problem with it, it was resolved within less than a day by going to the Apple store. The product is still working very well 5 years later, and at no point did the process of keeping it that way make me want to tear my hair out. Meanwhile the Asus tablet I have had for less than a year is somewhere in Texas and I have no assurance if and when it will be repaired or returned to me.
I'm not saying Mac products are inherently better than Asus. In fact I specifically chose an Asus tablet over an iPad because I wanted to be able to watch TV shows and movies without having to go through iTunes. Apple is very proprietary about its apps, while the Android platform is much more open source. But at the end of the day, better a bird in the hand than 3 in the bush (as in - I still don't have my tablet back and it's been a month since I sent it in for repairs!).
I hope this feedback helps.

39926603 great price,excellent quality ,nice picture and fast!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

..

39926603 This is a great tablet for the money. As far as I am concerned not much different than an I-pad.

..

39926603 Great product and an excellent value. This was a gift for my wife and she loves it. Don't over pay for an apple product. This tablet does everything you could possibly want and more. Even or 3 year old cam operate it with ease.

..

39926603 My kids absolutel;y love this tablet. they download alot of games. Very easy to manage.

..

39926603 I had a previous Android tablet that finally failed. While looking through reviews and testing the actual product in the store, I had my heart set on another model tablet when the salesperson asked if I had considered the ASUS MeMO Smart. I was blown away by the crisp graphics and how light the tablet was. SOLD!

..

39926603 I am glad to have gotten this. Would buy it again.

..

39926603 Bought this tablet for my wife as a birthday present. Principle use was to do basic web browsing, and to connect to our tv to watch movies on netflix, youtube,etc. After a few days of working fine, the internet failed to connect. All other devices at our home connected fine. We took it to a few public places to connect to their wi-fi and could not. We took the tablet back to have them look at it, and they said it was fine. We tried again and even asked a few tech savy little brothers, and they both concluded the tablet was the issue. We finally returned it and got a different insignia model that cost less, and has given us no issues.

..

39926603 I purchased this after spending several weeks reading reviews. I didn't want an iPad because I'm Android-oriented. I compared the Asus Memo to the Galaxy Tab 3 and found the benefits to exceed the Tab. The key selling point were the reviews indicating the that the Memo didn't have the root app overload of the Tab, which is a plus.
I haven't had any problems with my screen protector effecting functionality or anything like that. The speakers are great, but I wish that there was an external volume control.
I just discovered the multi-user option so that each user can download his on apps and emails.
I'm quite satisfied with my purchase.

..

39926603 For my first tablet compared to the Samsung galaxy this is just mind blowing. The picture quality is to line, what's even better is the screen has the gorilla glass and my dog has jumped on it several times and not one scratched it. It picks up wifi very easily. The setting features are easy to understand and to use. The camera on this tablet takes very good night time pictures. Over alk this is an easy and user tablet for its price!

..

39926603 This is a good tablet for the money, I like the choice of applications for the Android OS.

..

..

39926603 Spent $450 new at bestbuy and this tablet will no longer hold a chrge after 14 months. Do NOT waste your money on this as you will be VERY dissapointed. As for functionality is WAS a great tablet but will never buy another ASUS again.

39926603 My oldest so s off to college and after much research chose this tablet for its balance of battery life, power, features and a keyboard. AWESOME.

..

39926603 the asus transformer is a good tablet. it has good resolution and a great rear facing camera. i was able to upgrade os to jellybean tablet runs very smooth.

..

39926603 Amazed with clarity, sharpness, sound. Easy to navigate especially if you are not a techy.

..

39926603 This is an awesome tablet for the price. Had to drive 80 miles to the only store still in stock for this closeout. Well worth it. Great graphics, ease of use, good battery life, quad core processor anazing. Size and weight is perfect for balance.

..

39926603 I loved this tablet, it brings great connectivity with the USB and bluetooth connection. It also allows for adding extra memory and has a micro HDMI connection. Screen is very cool and has DUAL camera so it's perfect for skyping as well. It also brings Jelly Bean and there was an update by Asus which greatly improved the look of the keyboard.
Best tablet around!

..

39926603 I had been shopping for a tablet for a while. I like the iPads but my phone is Android, so I wanted tablet that would have similar interface and app's as my phone. Mostly use it for personal use but some business when I don't want to carry a laptop. For the price and how I use it, I am very happy with it.

..

39926603 As stated in the title, this tablet offers great bang for the buck.
Has a fast quad core CPU, 10" 10.1" LED Backlight WXGA (1280x800) IPS panel with wide viewing angles, but is still easy on the battery.
What really set this apart from other tablets is that it also has a HDMI port (e.g. able to connect to a HDTV) and microSD card support for extended storage.
Was also able to upgrade to latest Jelly Bean (latest Android OS).

..

39926603 Good performance. Plays most videos. Internet browsing could be better. Plays most games. Battery life less than 5 hrs playing games, could be better

..

39926603 I love my tablet. You can't beat all its qualities for the price. I just wish the accessories easier to find.

..

39926603 I got it for $99 so it was worth it...............

39926603 Do NOT purchase this machine. Best Buy, Geek Squad and ASUS do not back this machine, and the hard drive on mine failed on month 4 of ownership with light use. Just one months AFTER the 90 warrenty to expire. I thought ASUS hard drives lasted longer then that but I was mistaken.

6006839590008 These picks were thinner than I expected. They have a very good grip. I would buy these again but with the correct thickness.

6006839590008 I am happy that I purchased them, they are exactly what I was looking for

..

6006839590008 I like them. They are nice and light. I call them cheater picks. As far as i know not to many people use them. But I like a light pick. Try them, you might like them. If you play light it might be the pick for you, or maybe not.

Extend your dynamic range with these Ernie Ball Power Slinky P02720 electric guitar strings that feature cobalt material to ensure crisp, clean highs and enhanced low-end sound.


..

6006839590008 They are the best guitar strings I have ever used...

..

6006839590008 Let me preface by saying that I do not care for Ernie Ball strings, but I am now a firm believer with these new Cobalt strings. The tone is brighter, focused and very smooth to the touch. I bought two sets initially, still on my first set and so far after one week they still sound phenomenal. These strings will wake up your guitar.

..

6006839590008 I restrung my Stratocaster on 12-24-2013. I am restringing her today, 1-5-2014.
At first these strings deliver on their promise of a good rock throaty grumble, but after a few weeks they are as dead as yesterdays mackerel.
Maybe they are meant for a stage performer who can afford to change strings in between performances but for someone whose just playing and learning they are simply not worth the extra price.
If it matters to anyone, I will be stringing with my favorite Ernie Ball Slinky nickels ....

..

6006839590008 There are by far the best guitar strings on the market....

..

6006839590008 New EB Cobalts:
These strings are extremely bright, did notice quite a bit more output as well. They feel like flat wound/nickel strings which aren't for me, also they were dead in one week. Not cool at S9.99 a pack!
Back to Regular Slinky's for me, You do have to try them though to find out for yourself if these are duds or studs!

..

6006839590008 It has very brite tone. I can really hearl the diffrence after I put them on. Last time I had the same feeling was when I had my first set of Elixir. I dont know about you guys but I had to plug my guitar to the tuner to tune my electric guitar but with these strings, I dont have to. I can do it as if it's acoustic since the tone is so brite.

..

6006839590008 my son has 6 music man guitars and one EVH he wont even think of other strings. He set up his string test at the university under controlled conditions. there was no comparison in frequency response and duration. he prefers passive pickups.

..

6006839590008 These strings did have a much noticeably crisper brightness and a definate ring to them. I used these on a old norlin era lester with overwound t-top humbuckr in the neck and a overwound dimarzio on the bridge .33uF spraque caps with 500k pushpull coil tap pot on the bridge pickup. Even when bridge is coiltapped this axe has always been very warm and even muddy. These strings did bring out more ring but the effects wore off after three or four sessions at which time I was ready to change the strings out anyways.
The price is marginally worth the add benefit. If I had a tone I wanted for a special studio project .... yeah it might help. I think I should just save up and get some good paf pups instead of trying to put a bandaid on the "problem" It would be interesting to hear these on a strat with the classic a.y. CS 69's vintage classic pups!?!

5.11 RUSH 24 Carrying Case (Backpack) for Travel Essential - Sandstone - Water Resistant - Nylon


..

6006840060008 This is a great pack! I have taken it camping, hiking, on the air plane, strapped on the motorcycle, even a great range bag. It's just small enough to use as a day pack. It holds my 17 inch Macbook Pro and my camelbak water bladder. Fully loaded I don't feel it pulling on my shoulders. It looks nice and dirt just brushes off of it. It's not water proof but it will take a good rain and the inside is still dry. I recommend this bag for just about any every day task. If you buy it, and you don't use the bladder pocket. I would suggest 5.11's water bottle attachment.

Ideal for bird-watchers, hunters and naturalists, this Barska Colorado CO11502 waterproof spotting scope offers 20-60x magnification to bring distant objects close. The waterproof and fog-proof design allows use in a variety of weather conditions.


..

6006840060008 I bought this to be used strictly as a spotting scope for the range. at 20x zoom, the target is clear and easy to see. 90% of my shooting is at 100yds, so the 60x zoom won't be used often. Overall, a good scope for the money if you're using it for shooting.

These Barska Gladiator Zoom AB11180 binoculars feature an 8-24x magnification range for clear viewing of wide areas, such as long-distance terrestrial or celestial expanses. The zoom thumb lever makes it easy to make quick zoom adjustments.


..

6006840060008 The first order, they came with a broken top focus lens that was completely cracked all around only being held on by the rubber eye piece and also cracked in other sorts of ways on the inside. The second set they lenses don't even turn at all and are not lined up, one is a bit up from the other; basically your one eye is up and the other is a bit down from the other. I don't recommend anyone to get these. Both orders were defective/damaged. There is also a 10-30 version of these as well.

The Bluetooth technology of this Acoustic Research Skinit AWSBTSK portable speaker allows you to wirelessly stream music from a Bluetooth-enabled device from up to 32.8' away for easy use.


..

6006840060008 My son has this speaker in his yard and it works great and looks nice. I was pleased with the price and also the promptness of its arrival!

..

6006840060008 I got this from Best Buy - opened it plugged the AC power adapter and pressed the power button (it was supposed to blink blue light) - nothing happened no matter how long and hard i pressed the power button. The speaker was "Dead on Arrival". I am not sure if this is a common issue or I've got a bad device.

..

6006840060008 This is a good product for iPhone and iPad, It uses the blue tooth capability to vastly improve the sound quality.

..

6006840060008 This speaker is fine, it's not great. Set up took minutes, but was disappointed in the sound. Volume level is okay, just no way to adjust output and the bass is not great. Will use it especially for outdoors.

..

6006840060008 I ordered the Acoustic Research Bluetooth Speaker on December 26, 2013 and received the product on January 2, 2014. The speaker was paired with my MAC and two iPhones within 10 minutes. The sound is great considering the size, and the portability is very practical. I intend to use for my trips to the beach and weekly outings. Another added bonus is the auto shut-off when the speaker is not in use.

..

6006840060008 Great item I recommend it. Super sound quality. Easy to use.

..

6006840060008 If I knew this item was this wonderful I would have purchase more than 1 when it was on sale. Watching for the next sale.

..

6006840060008 The batteries lasted me many hours on full volume at the beach. Sounds great. Much better than the speakers that are smaller than your hand and not as heavy as a homemade ice chest system.
I would highly recommend for outside festivities. Bluetooth is super easy to use also.

..

6006840060008 I have a lot of music on my IPad, but of course the sound wasn't very good. I had bought really cheap speakers and they were, of course, disappointing also. This speaker sounds very good without costing a fortune.

..

6006840060008 This bluetooth speaker is awesome. Easy to connect to different devices, excellent high, mid, and low range. I listened outside and it was very clear and full sound. 4 of us took turns connecting our iphones to have a wide variety of music and it was simple to connect and disconnect.

Comfortably type on your iPad 2 or iPad (3rd Generation) using this Adonit Writer Plus ADW3B Bluetooth keyboard. The keyboard detaches easily, letting you use the rubber-covered, suede-interior folio to protect your device from damage on the go.


..

6006840060008 The case itself was poor quality. The keyboard seems to be acceptable but not usable without the case. I tried taking back to the store but they wouldn't take it back.

..

6006840060008 The unit worked great out of the box. There were no issues synching with the ipad. It is easy to adjust for better viewing.

..

6006840060008 I bought this product just as the school semester came to an end. So, I have not had the opportunity to really test it for my actual needs. The initial testing phase has went very well, though.

..

6006840060008 This cover/keyboard is perfect for me when I travel for conferences as I do not have to carry laptop or my other bulky iPad cover. The keybaord is easy to link to the iPad and the charge lasts for quite a bit. However, I do not use this cover when I'm at home as I need better protection for my iPad from my kids.

..

6006840060008 Good price point. Works well. Makes the iPad more functional.

..

6006840060008 The keyboard itself is great. I even wondered about keeping it just for the keyboard. But, the rest of the case was awful. I kept digging in the box to find the real case.

..

6006840060008 I bought this based on the description. I didn't like it at all after I received it. The quality of the material was very inferior. It was sharp around the edges and it didn't look good with my iPad. I had to return it.

..

6006840060008 Highly Recommend:
I was pleasantly surprised when I received this iPad keyboard and cover. The keyboard is very good and even has built-in iPad functioning keys (i.e. lock screen, home key, search key, mute, cut-copy-paste, etc.). The battery lasts generally 2 weeks before recharging (according to instructions). Cover automatically turns off keyboard and the iPad when in closed folded position. You can adjust the screen at various angles. The keyboard can detach while the screen is standing up toward you - very cool ! The keyboard and cover feel great and sturdy. The Writer uses a magnet to stay close. You can even use it in your lap. Keyboards are always personal preference. But, work with it for a while and you will love this set.
There is no way to adjust keyboard position - lies flat. There is No way to replace the rechargeable battery. The on/off switch is hard to operate, but the unit shuts off automatically when it is closed. The cover will not provide 100% protection from drops.

6006840060008 
Rock out with this 2-channel Behringer Ultrabass bass amplifier head that features a switchable Ultrabass subharmonics processor to ensure robust low-end tone. Class D amplifier technology delivers powerful sound.


..

6006840060008 I bought this amp despite there being no reviews, I think it is a relatively new product from Behringer. Overall, for $180, a 300 W amp with the features that this amp has is a steal. I play in a band (heavy metal) and have to get loud enough to compete with a ENGL 100W amp and a 150W Line6 amp plugged into a 4x12 Mesa cab, plus I ned to cut through the drums and vocals. The fact this my set up cuts through the HIGH end equipment that cost exponentially more than my gear is remarkable. I have a custom made P-bass (mohagany body, maple neck and GFS pickups, 4 strings tuned to Drop C) and a custom 1x18 cab with a tweeter at 8ohm resistance. I use a Digitech BP200 multi-effects pedal as a preamp. I have no issue cutting through and with the input and master volume at 5, it vibrates the house and I need to play with earplugs. I was previously using a 2x12 100W guitar amp for my bass. I was missing low end and I had to crank the volume so loud that the amp cab started rattling. I am very happy with this amp.
Features that are great:
Class D technology- ultra clean with a frequency range of 20 Hz to 20kHz, you can plug a bass or guitar into it and it sounds great. Looking online, a lot of the old school tube amp guys are getting into Class D because it is so clean. It doesn't require much power and has not gotten hot yet, despite the fact that I push it pretty hard for up to 4 hours straight. It only weighs 7 lbs, which is great since hauling around heavy equipment every week is annoying. The guitar amp I was using is 50 lbs.
Ultrabass function - some people may not like this but I have been using it when playing higher notes in some songs, sounds awesome when bass is playing notes at two octaves, hitting the same notes as lead guitar.
7 band Graphic Equalizer with FBQ response - Just a great function to have to dial in your sound, most amps <$500 have three band EQ.
Distortion - Not something I use regularly since bass doesn't typically mix well with distortion except when playing higher notes, but the distortion sound on this amp is pretty good . It isn't very aggressive, when I plug my six string into it, its a moderate distortion. It is not a tube overdrive, bluesy or heavy metal distortion but I do like the distortion sound. Most <$500 bass amps don't have a distortion feature.
Line in Gain- Great to have to dial in input levels depending if you have active or passive pickups.
Footswitch - great to have a stomp pedal to activate ultrabass and switch between clean/distortion.
Music in, headphones out - haven't used these features yet since I can do it with the BP200 but they are great features to have.
Overall, this amp has all the basic bells and whistles noted above, most bass amps don't have fancy multi effects you can find integrated with guitar amps such as the Line6 Spider series. It gets very loud and is a really good price. I have had it for over a month and pushed it hard and have no issues yet. The fact that there is a two year warranty on it is also great. I can dial in my sound easily, and right now i have 3 bass settings on my BP200 for trebly/twangy sound, deep bass sound, and a light chorus for bass tapping. I usually fingerpick but it still sounds great using a plectrum or slapping.
Dislikes:
There is a small, loose piece of platic in the enclosure, I could open it up and take it out but it doesnt affect the function of the amp. It is just something that shouldn't be there.
Plastic Enclosure - It is not really an issue but a steel or aluminum construction would be cool. There is a plastic ridge on the bottom instead of feet, which makes it vibrate and move on my cab because it is a wood construction, but i remedy this with a thin rubber mat.
Best Buy had the best price on this amp, only comparing with Amazon but it had a longer warranty, and if I ever have any issues I can just go to the store instead of dealing with customer service over the phone and having to ship it. I did extensive reasearch online looking for an amp that fit my budget, and the BXD3000H was the best bang for my buck by far. I havent heard many bass amps, so I can't compare it to another amp but I don't really care to because this amp has the sound, output and versatility that I wanted.

Enjoy on-the-go entertainment with this Belkin @TV Plus G1V1000 set-top box, which allows you to watch live TV and DVR-recorded programs on a Wi-Fi-enabled tablet, mobile phone, laptop or other mobile device.


..

6006840060008 Slingbox has been around a little longer but Belkin did exactly what they was supposed to do which was under cut the competition with out sacrificing quality. If they come out with a newer version I can only imagine how much better it could be.

..

6006840060008 I ordered it cautiously not knowing what to expect. It is a rather big box for its function, but I set it up physically using the quick start guide in about 5 min in my guest room on my whole home dvr system (directv). The software installed easily but my 2wire router from AT&T Uverse was difficult to set up the port forwarding on. That took me about 20 min. It works flawlessly now, the quality is quite good from my office computer and at home. Iphone quality is about what you'd expect, a little patchy. Of course, its dependent on the quality of your internet connection.

..

6006840060008 Setup was quick and easy. Everything I needed was included in the box. Got the App for my Galaxy off the Play Store, setup and running. Great for road warriors with hotel and airport time on their hands.

..

6006840060008 Bought this originally because it was cheaper than a Slingbox... All that I ended up doing was having to spend more time with a return.
Set up was not bad...after I spent 30 minutes downloading their incredibly large setup wizard/ player. After that, the quality of the stream was sub par.... I couldn't even figure out which team I was cheering for. They both looked like blurs.... This product still has a long way to come to be anywhere competitive to a Slingbox. Word of warning.... Its a bit cheaper, but don't waste your time. Just go buy a new Slingbox. Light years better than the @TV...

With the same durable construction and thoughtful design details found in all our iPad Air covers, the FreeStyle Case for iPad takes sleek protection to a whole new level. Works with: iPad Air PROTECTION & VIEWING VERSATILITY The FreeStyle Cover iPad Air Case comes with an innovative QuickStand, a front cover that snaps to the back of the case. When opened, you can use it as a stand, and rotate your iPad Air to view content in either portrait or landscape mode. When you want to use the slim case on its own, just detach it and go. SECURE FIT Our FreeStyle iPad Air Cover isn't just about good looks--it also provides reliable protection. Snap your iPad Air into the fitted frame to securely hold it in place and just push down on the corners of the frame when you want to remove it.

The same clasp can be used to hold the cover back and out of the way while you're using your tablet.


..

6006840060008 Very functional while slim and light weight . Also like black

..

6006840060008 I bought this cover for my ipad. It is just what I needed.

..

6006840060008 Bought this right before a trip and wanted some protection for the Air.
Worked great during travel. Also use it for everyday use to prop the Air in either landscape or portrait mode. Very handy.
Only wished that it would automatically put the Air to sleep when the cover is on. Otherwise it would be perfect

..

6006840060008 It is a very nice case. You can easily detach the iPAD from the case via a magnet attachment. You can also swivel it 360 degrees.

..

6006840060008 Overall I'm very happy with this case. I especially like the fact that the cover comes off and back on with a magnet. You can remove the cover and just hold the ipad by itself. The back is protected in a hard shell. The magnet allows you to rotate the ipad and view it both in portrait and landscape positions. It comes off easily but stays securely attached when you want it to.
It is well constructed and does not feel cheap. It does feel light which is a good thing. No point in buying an air but it feels like lead with a weighty case.
One limitation is that it doesn't have the magnets to automatically turn off the iPad. Also, the "low" position seems odd. You have to flip the case the other way to use it. It still works however. The only other feature, I would have enjoyed is an elastic band to slide my hand into.
These last items would make this an "everything" case. The fact that it doesn't have these doesn't take away from what it is.

..

6006840060008 I like this cover because of how thin it is and how lightweight. It also is great for positioning your iPad at different angles. Also has the best fit for the new Ipad Air.

..

6006840060008 the case is protective and serves as a stand--very convenient. the price of $60 I think is high however.

..

6006840060008 Well designed case. Protects and sleek. This was affordable and good value for the price.

..

6006840060008 I like this cover, it was easy to apply and gives good protection to my ipad.

..

6006840060008 Overall a good buy. I exchanged the Targus case I reviewed previously for this one. Only downside is that when deploying the screen for use, it only feels secure and won't slip in two of the six available grooves. Fortunately, the two positions, the one that gives the greatest angle from the horizontal and the one that gives the smallest, are the ones that work best for me. The former is best for viewing and reading and the latter is best for writing emails.

Bring your tablet into the kitchen without cluttering the counter. The Kitchen Cabinet Mount helps keep your tablet in view and securely suspended on any cabinet or shelf.


..

6006840060008 Bought this for my wife and she uses it all the time for viewing recipes while she cooks. Only took a few minutes to setup on a cabinet next to the stove. Wife can view recipes or watch tv while she cooks. is at perfect height for viewing while standing up and is sturdy enough that you don't feel like you are going to knock it off if you press too hard.

..

6006840060008 Great product - only suggestion would be to make it swivel a bit.

..

6006840060008 That's it. Maybe wait for a sale before you buy it, but otherwise this is an easy "Recommend"

..

6006840060008 I have an iPad2 and it does everything I need it to do. It is easily stowed when not in use, holds my iPad securely in place (even with a smart cover), and keeps the iPad off of the counter and away from splattering pots and pans while I'm in the kitchen. Well worth the price - you won't be disappointed!

..

6006840060008 I was looking for a way to view recipes and movies, listen to music, etc. in my kitchen. I wanted to get my tablet up OFF the counter, and I wanted it to be safe and secure. This contraption does it all! I especially like that I can grab the tablet securely with two hands and slide it out. It's much safer than if I had to maneuver it with one hand. It is NOT in the way, and not bad looking. I tend to leave it out all the time except when company is coming.

..

6006840060008 Keeps my iPad handy, but out of the way while cooking. A little bit of a tight fit if I leave the leather iPad case on, but it works. The directions for connecting it to the cabinet probably weren't as clear as they could have been, however it wasn't too hard to figure out.

..

6006840060008 A little shaky but holds my iPad well. Nice product

..

6006840060008 This is perfect for use in my kitchen--my iPad fits securely in the mount and I can stream movies/tv while I'm working. It may have saved me hundreds of dollars in purchasing a tv and having a cable hookup put into my kitchen. Easy to use and an excellent product. I highly recommend.

..

6006840060008 Mounts on and off very easily, and was glad that I could fit my iPad 1 without having to take it out of the Apple iPad case I keep it in. Very convenient.

..

6006840060008 Love this mount. It is very sturdy. I actually use it in my semi and it stays in place going down the road.

This juice extractor features a wide feed tube that allows you to juice a variety of fruit and vegetable sizes. The 600-watt motor delivers efficient juicing power.


..

6006840060008 only thing to be concerned about is the clean up afterwards

..

6006840060008 Overall this product is good value for money. Only thing I didn't like is to remove 5-6 components to clean...

..

6006840060008 this juicer is great as long as you read and follow ALL directions in the manual....it can get clogged if you use the wrong fruit or put in large pieces, but overall it works really well...I use the leftover pulp to make muffins and apple sauce.....

..

6006840060008 I tried it for 2 days and that is all it took to take it back for a refund. Maybe the plunger is not long enough or the blades are not sharp enough, but fruit and vegetables never made all the way through which defeats the purpose of the product.

Bissell CleanView 82H1 Upright Vacuum Cleaner - 12 A - Bagless - Black


..

6006840060008 Light, great suction, great for carpet
Super fast shipping! 1- great vaccum specially for a student (affordable) and great for apartments 2- suction is amazing! I was surprised by the amount of dust that it sucked it 10 sec from my carpet!! I just vaccumed it with a hoover! But still so much dust that this vaccum sucked from it! My roomate was mad at her vaccum (hoover) when she saw mine! The light is my favorite feature then you can see easily even in the dark! Bad side: power cord which is not auto wrapper (i think if they want to add this feature it's gonna cost more, so maybe that's why they came up with a good price for such a great vaccum, so i dont mind

..

6006840060008 I love my new toy better than my KIRBY....which was very expensive...

..

6006840060008 this is a great item it gets the job done and i dont get frustired going over the same area over and over again cause it didnt pick somehting up

..

6006840060008 I am very pleased with this vacuum. It works great and is a great deal for the money. I highly recommend it!

..

6006840060008 When I found out Dyson vacuums are non-refundable that propelled me in another direction when I was searching for a new vacuum. I needed a good performing unit and wanted a lot of suction. My budget was a fairly healthy one but to my surprise I settled on the Bissell Cleanview Helix, a favorably low priced model.
Not all the reviews were favorable mostly due to the fact that the filters can clog with dust and debri quite easily. That meant one thing to me...good suction. Keeping this in mind I purchased an extra set of filters because with this vacuum the filters can be washed. So about every 3rd use I wash the filters and switch them with the set of clean, dry filters. This has kept the vacuum in tip top shape.
The vacuum is a lighter weight for it's class so I can go up and down the stairs more readily than with some of the others, which is good because I am disabled. I like the attachment for the staircase however the hose could be a bit longer for more ease of use.
So if you are willing to really go the extra step to maintain this vacuum I think it will prove to be a good buy, if you do not wish to do so, then I would not recommend this unit to you. I am, however, quite happy with it because I knew up front what I was getting into.

..

6006840060008 Got this vacuum to replace a stick vacuum as my girlfriends long-haired cat put that poor thing to death dealing with the fur. This vacuum is doing a great job of picking up the extra fluff that floats around the house.
First it has good adjustments. I have mostly bare floors with some carpet and rugs about. I can adjust as I hit different areas of the house.
Its pretty easy to pick up and move around. Seems to still be pretty solid though.
Cleaning the bag less system is pretty easy. Dump it out every so often, and wash it out every other dump. This might need to happen more often for those of you with carpets.
The little attachment just doesn't cut it for me. It doesn't pick up very well in the instances I've tried to use it. So I mostly just avoid using it now. However, having the hose that you can pull out to get to tight spots works well.
Overall, a good vacuum. I think it'll last me a while.

..

6006840060008 THE VACUUM CLEANER IS GOOD, but need improvement on the suction part.

..

6006840060008 This is a great deal for the price! I would highly recommend this to anyone. I have a large family with lots of kids, so I am always vacuuming. This takes the "work" out of the job. I Love this vacuum.

..

6006840060008 we had bought a different vacuum at best buy. one of the more poular brands.. we were very disapointed with it and returned it for this one. this one was less money and when we cleaned over the area we had previously cleaned with the other, we got more dirt and animal hair out.
Two other people where i work purchased this vacuum and are extremly satisfied. they are pet owners also

Keep your pet cool and your house clean with this pet grooming tool that helps remove loose hair from your pet. The hose bends and swivels, so you can move around your pet with ease.


..

6006840060008 My beagle loves to be brushed. This just takes the hassle out of having to clean up afterwards or brushing her outside. She wasn't ever really scared of the vacuum cleaner, but avoided it. I put the vacuum behind me and reach the hose to my front. She lays there and loves it! It picks up A LOT of the hair.

..

6006840060008 A great idea and not too pricey. However, if your dogs need a real brushing, which is when the bulk of the fur really flies, this brush head will not do the trick. With a different brush head this would be great, but as it is it is useless to us and the amount of fur I brush out of my dogs regularly.

..

6006840060008 What a waste of money, I should have returned it but waited too long. I would not recommend this product to anyone. I could find alot of things that I could spend $70 on. This thing was'nt worth $5. The tank keeps falling off and it also leaks all the time. It soaks the floor and leaves residue marks everywhere. Also there it doesnt stand upright on its own, if you have to stop mopping for a minute you have to lean it on the wall or something, otherwise it falls over..WARNING....DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT !!!!!

..

6006840060008 I bought this to use on wood laminate floors. I thought it would be just the thing to sweep and mop more quickly. I failed that litmus test. It is very heavy and has no power. The mopping feature is you constantly pushing the lever that squirts out hot water. It's a joke. I paid full price for it which was almost $100 . What a disappointment. I would take it back, but I was so sure it was going to be a good investment, I threw away the box and don't have the receipt.

..

6006840060008 Bought it and returned it the next day. The tank kept on falling off and it was leaking all over.

..

6006840060008 My first mop did not steam. The second mop had steam when the pad was off. When the steam hit the pad it cooled it back to water and left puddles on my new hard wood floor. I went out and bought a Shark. It steams like advertised.

..

6006840060008 my husband is a diabetic and I have to clean my ceramic floors daily, this little mop made my life so much easier Thanks Bissell

..

6006840060008 I was hesitant at first about mopping with no cleaners. Wondering just how clean can my floors get without soap. After mopping my hardwood and vinyl floors, now I'm convinced. It does work. After mopping my hardwood floor, I saw streaks being left behind. But, I soon realized it was all the leftover chemicals being dissolved and brought up from previous cleaners (ie. Swiffer Wet Jet). I continued using once a week and BAM! no more streaks. Another word of caution, do not be so trigger happy. That will cause streaking. Floors dried instantly. (Something you worry about on hardwood). It saves money. Just wash and hang dry the mop covers. You may want to buy distilled water to use in it, as I have hard water. This will prolong filter life. The attached water bottle will last a very long time. A full tank last me 3 weeks and I mop six rooms with it every week. I wish the cord was a little longer, as I have to find closer plugs to finish mopping. But, not a big deal. It stays hot and ready.

..

6006840060008 I am not at all happy with this product. It is very hard to maneuver and leaves the floor dripping wet - worse than a mop.

..

6006840060008 It cleans great and it is easy to use. It warms up fast and the steam is visable as you use it. The floor looks cleaner after I done.

..

6006840060008 I would not recommend this mop. The only way to get your floors clean is on your hands and knees with a bucket, water with a cleaning solution in it and a rag. This mop only smeared the dirt around.

Push-button control panel with digital display; 1-touch operation for popular foods and functions
Adjustable time and temperature; convection fan for even heating; fits a 12-inch pizza
See-through glass door; slide-out crumb tray; baking pan and rotisserie spit/forks included
Measures approximately 13-4/5 by 21-4/5 by 16-1/2 inches; 1-year limited warranty


..

6006840060008 Had it for about 6 months and it's great!! Heats up fast and does a better job cooking evenly then my oven does!!

..

6006840060008 It performs decently but you can't change the temp or timer on some settings until it preheats. It is as big as a microwave! I didn't check the dimensions because it's a toaster oven. I haven't cooked a pizza in it yet, but I'm sure it would turn out just fine. My biggest complaints are its size and the inability to choose your own setting.

..

6006840060008 This is an easy oven to use and heats up quickly. It is easy to clean and looks good in our kitchen. I would recommend to others. This is a nice oven for the price.

..

6006840060008 I ordered online from BestBuy.com and it arrived very promptly. I love the digital timer and settings. In the past I've had knobs that would break or get loose. I can put my food in, set the temp, set the time and forget about it. It notifies me when it's ready and shuts itself off if I can't get to it immediately. So far I haven't found anything that was too large for it to handle.

..

6006840060008 I'm sure the convection and the toaster over works great, but my mistake was buying this product for the rotisserie! The first one I bought just stopped working after only a few months, so I returned it for a new one. Now the problem I have with this second one the rotisserie spit/forks and skewer that inserts into your meat are completely rusted over. I can not use it at all for that reason and have the fun of returning this product again.

..

6006840060008 My family of 5 us getting a lot of use out of this toaster oven from pizzas, to rotisserie pork roast, chicken strips, broiling brats etc. It does a great job. My only complaint would be it takes quite a while to toast bread/bagels. It is very easy to clean and keep clean.

..

6006840060008 I wanted to buy a new toaster oven. I came here to Bestbuy and read a bunch of reviews. This one seemed to be highly recommended on most reviews.
So I purchased this one. It's been great. It has many preset buttons for cooking regular items, ie toast, pizza etc. They can be adjusted depending on say, how dark you want your toast to be. Then that is the preset setting. I highly recommend it. Let expensive than a lot of the others also.

..

6006840060008 I purchased this to save on using the oven for energy conservation, but it uses more energy than my oven. It is probably because it does not seal at all, also really heats up the ikitchen.
For the price, I am very disappointed. I could have bought a cheaper model and probably been just as satisfied.

..

6006840060008 great oven and toaster easy to use. especiallly like the rotisserie feature. have nothing negative about this product. cooks everything evenly fits a 12 inch pizza with ease. easy to clean.

..

6006840060008 This is a great toaster oven. I have only had it a week, but so far really good. The built in preset for Pizza, cookies, and frozen snacks work well. If I had one complaint it would be that the default timer for the presets are a little long, but they are easily changable, so it becomes a none issue. Oven heats fast and the fan helps cook evenly.
It toasts bread great! Has different levels of darkness and they are spot on!
Looked at other cheaper models but, they just didn't have the features, or weren't big enough. Glad I spent a little more to get this.
Highly recommend this appliance.

When we think of the benefits of using our BISTRO Blender Stick, three things immediately come to mind; it's easy and fun to work with, it helps make nutritious foods, and it's easy to clean. It comes with three easy stick-on attachments: the knife for making anything from mouthwatering smoothies on ice to steamy creamy vegetable soups; the whisk for making fabulously airy mashed potatoes; and the beater for making thick milk foam, whipped cream or for beating eggs. It also comes with a beaker for pureing and storing leftovers in the fridge when it's topped of with the lid. The BISTRO Blender Stick is great for baby food, too, by the way. It will become your number one can't-live-without kitchen tool in no time. Just stick it into any pan, pot, glass or bowl and it will do its job effortlessly at push of a button. Once you're done, simply let it run in a bowl of hot water for a bit and it cleans itself. The 2-speed BISTRO Blender Stick is made from plastic and stainless steel.

Monitor your activity and calories burned like contestants on The Biggest Loser with this BodyMedia FIT LINK 100768 armband that delivers real-time feedback to help you achieve your fitness goals. Multivariable tracking ensures accurate readings.


..

6006840060008 I love the link. I've used different monitors and this one has been the best so far. The app is straighforward and easy to use. The only things that were a pain was getting used to the spot to wear it and the bluetooth; just my little annoyances. It's a cool way to keep track and motivate yourself. Ifyou're really on a mission, I definitely recommend. Don't waste your money if you're only going to use it for a week.

..

6006840060008 I owned a similar product before and lost it. it helped me with my fitness goals quite a bit. when I got active again I felt I had to have one of these,

..

6006840060008 In January 2014 my workout partner and I purchased the Bodymedia Fit Core Arm Bands. For me it was because I needed to know my daily burn from midnight to midnight in order to help break my 220 plateau. That plateau was broke the first full week I used the arm band because I was able to see exactly (or a accurate estimate) of my calorie deficit based on my calorie goal, food intake, and physical activity.
Based on Feb 1 - Feb 7 Food Consumed and Actual Burn estimates given by the body media arm band monitor, my daily deficit was as follows:
Feb 1: 791
Feb 2: 1168
Feb 3: 1211
Feb 4: 851
Feb 5: 929
Feb 6: 1700
Feb 7: 961
Total weekly deficit was 7611 then divided by 3500 (lb) = 2.2 (lbs loss estimate) I lost 2 lbs that week (solid). The monitor does report accurate estimates of actual burn based on 5000 body readings a minute 23 hours a day. Measuring body temp, perspiration, movement, and from the videos I've watched the device reads the body like it were a computer. (pretty amazing) (thanks IBM)
My deficit was higher some days not because I did not eat (i eat believe me) but because I was more active and always aware of my activity level via online activity manager and app for my smart phone.
The device has come down in price as well as the subscription fee. For less than 7 dollars a month (after 3 month free) I have access to my actual burn, activity level, sleep quantity & quality, deficit (based on food entry), and I can view my actual burn live while I work out. The band and device are sturdy, sweat resistant, built for torture. Ever evolving with firmware updates. (if I can pay 15 bucks a month to play a video game online or pay to watch movies every month online) I was sure as hell going to be the 7 bucks to see what the hell was up with my body. (to be blunt)
If your stuck in a plateau or need help loosing weight/managing your weight once and for all and don't want to have to go through 3 years of trial and error like I did, try it and you will see for yourself.
I'm new to youtube so if you want to see my lame videos: Check out my youtube unboxing and bodymedia fit arm band progress videos. http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuWwAuFhOFqLTqHbPEtWsnw

..

6006840060008 Great device but all that is missing is heart rate view

..

6006840060008 like that it tracks steps and.calories. wearing it is like its not even on, doesn't get in the way

..

6006840060008 This is a great activity tracker. It's pretty accurate and I really liked the app interface. The bluetooth function helps a ton, and i use it every day!

..

6006840060008 This product is great for calorie counting and weight loss. Definitely worth the cost.

..

6006840060008 Awesome, very easy to setup...I have lost 20 since I purchased the equipment, which was 2 months ago

..

6006840060008 The more you wear this device, the more accurate it is and acclimates to your body. I generally wear mine all day everyday except for the shower. Really doesn't bother me. Just make sure to wipe it off after a good work out because the sweat can make it feel sticky. I compared every tracking device (fit bit, polar, basis and more) before purchasing and I am extremely pleased. The link fir band also has blue tooth capabilities so if you have a smart phone it's the one you want! Easy read out and user friendly.
It is easy to wear but I do wish it was a little more attractive, maybe an all black design would look cool. If only if only :)

..

6006840060008 Everything works fine except downloading the firmware. Returned one device but new one does the same thing. I will have to call tech support.

Wirelessly stream the music on your Apple iPod, iPhone or iPad with this Boston Acoustics MC200Air speaker system that features AirPlay audio technology, so you can easily enjoy your favorite tunes. BassTrac circuitry provides deep, robust sound.


..

6006840060008 Great sound system for ipads and ipohones. Played holiday music all season long, sounded great.

..

6006840060008 Connects with our apple devices through Airplay to play music throughout the whole house. Sounds great. Great price.

..

6006840060008 We got this to use in the exercise room for the tv but discovered the tv was too old to hook up to it. we now use it for on the porch hooked to the iPod. The sound is just amazing my brother even said it almost sounded like a Bose.

..

6006840060008 Was looking for a wireless speaker for my deck and saw this $199 speaker on sale for $49.99. It was a great purchase. The speaker has excellent sound and was very easy to connect to my iPhone and iPad. I would highly recommend this product.

..

6006840060008 I bought this on a whim without having listened to it and I am highly impressed with Boston Acoustics on this one.
Despite this being a wireless connection, the sound comes through crisp and clear for high, mids, and lows. Although it doesn't reach the lowest of the human spectrum of hearing, it still has a very good bass kick. The range covers my entire apartment which is about 1000 square feet so I can move around with my iPod and control the sound from wherever.
I tested out a lot of different kinds of music and the only thing that did not play as well was Hip Hop and that being because the range of the product only gets down to 70 hz as opposed to 20 hz being the bottom of the human hearing range. I still got a decent bass kick and was able to make out the entire spectrum of everything.
The only thing about this product that was slightly frustrating was the set-up but once I figured it out that was not even that bad.
For design, sound, range, and ease of set-up I easily give this product 5 stars. (It even has an aux port for those who don't like the OS operating system for their devices).

..

6006840060008 Bought this as a single purpose audio player. The ability to stream from iPhone 5 to player works well and the sound output is large. Fidelity is better than good however the unit has no individual controls for bass or treble, this is a slight drawback when wanting to listen in the evening with a reduced bass response so not to bother others in the house.

..

6006840060008 Good product for the money. Would definitely recommend for spare room, bedroom, etc.

..

6006840060008 I'm not a a big Bose fan so I was trying to find an alternative. I stumbled across this on Beatweek Magazine. This speaker has a beatiful design, SOUNDS amazing and the setup is very easy. The sleep function is great since it wakes almost instantly and it's easy to send music from an Apple product...iphone, iPad or iMac . Very please with the purchase and glass I took the chance. As another reviewer stated I'm very surprised Best Buy would not display this unit in their stores!!!!! In the end this is an excellent choice and I may purchase another unit for a different room in my house.

..

6006840060008 I saw the Boston Acoustics MC 200 Air a while ago, and really found the design stunning. It does not look like the old toasterific/microwave-safe design from their old radio/iPod dock system. This is a beautifully designed speaker with Airplay, Bluetooth, and AUX inputs. We use it in a room with our home gym, so we can either stream music via Pandora through Bluetooth or through the AUX jack on the side to listen to the news while working out.
I am surprised that this isn't in any Best Buy stores, I found this product online after reading a review from the Boston facebook page.
Keep up the great work, Boston. With great-sounding products like this, you are going to put yourselves back on the map very quickly.

..

6006840060008 A good starter speaker for a kids room or school dorm.

..

6006840060008 I was having a lot of difficuly hearing my TV. The sound bar was not expensive and greatly enhanced the sound of my TV, but I would prefer that the sound could be more easily adjusted.

..

6006840060008 I was trying to save money and bought this on sale. If I knew that it was going to work when it wanted to and not when I wanted it to, I would have spent a little more and gotten something that worked better with my TV and my TV remote.
Poor instructions and just does not work like it should.

..

6006840060008 When the sound bar worked, the sound was good. Unfortunately, either I had a defective product or the hook-up cables suppied were faulty. The soundbar would just shut off on it's own after about 1 hour of using. Programming the remote was terrible -- so many steps and then it didn't work. Would not recommend this product

..

6006840060008 We mentioned in the store that the sound out of TV's cannot be heard as well as we thought. We have never had a soundbar and when we bought the soundbar and plugged it in, it was like a new world opened up to us. We have had so much enjoyment out of our new Vizio TV and soundbar combination.

..

6006840060008 This sound bar is ok. It does the job of enhancing the sound of our television. It is not as good as the ones that have an additional subwoofer, but if you have limited space, it does the job.

..

6006840060008 Ok sound bar but I would of wanted to spend a little more for better sound.Sometimes I get double voices...sounds like an echo..Learned my remote for volume up but not down..OK for now.I got it on sale so I won't complain.

..

6006840060008 This is a great product for a smaller area, system. The only problem we had was getting it to work with the universal remote. It works fine with the television remote though.

..

6006840060008 Great buy for a small room, under $200. Easy to install.

..

6006840060008 Attractive unit. If one likes lots of bass, it's wonderful. Unvortunately, the bass drives me nuts.

..

With the improved triple action free float system, increased motor speed and new SensoFoil, the new Series 3 not only delivers even better shaving performance on 3-day beards, but is also incredibly smooth on skin. 


..

6006840060008 This shaver has performed great over the last year. It delivers a close shave and is easy to maintain. The battery really holds a long charge compared to a trimmer that I have which usually dies after one use. I honestly have no complaints with the Braun Solo. Worth the money.

..

6006840060008 I have always used Norelco electric but changed to Braun . good product and good price. Does the job well and provides a close shave and feel like a wet shave.

..

6006840060008 Good value for money, works well, easy to clean, dual use

..

6006840060008 The Braun razor works great but for the price I would have expected a better charger cable and a case or cover for travel.

..

6006840060008 works great...after first charge went over three weeks before needing charged again!!

..

6006840060008 After reading others reviews I gave this a try and have not been disappointed. It cuts multiple day growth much better then the Norelco rotary I had been using. It seems to hold a charge longer then my rotary (or maybe it just gets the job done quicker).
Additionally, I feel it is easier to clean. I think the rotary motion does something to the stubble in the razor that makes it "stick" more to the blades and mechanism.
Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and will probably purchase a similar model when the time comes to replace it.

..

6006840060008 It's perfect. Have been using Braun for a while now and it has never disappointed me.

..

6006840060008 JUST BECAUSE IT'S NOT WET AND DRY DOESN'T MEAN IT WON'T GIVE YOU A GOOD SHAVE. IT'S A GOOD BANG FOR YOUR BUCK.

..

6006840060008 Great updated product from Braun. Strong, durable, and great shave.

..

6006840060008 Gave this as a gift for my brother. He's pleased that it's easy use and it does not give him a razor burn as manual shaving does. Easily charges, my brother does. It give this product any negative review.

..

6006840060008 blends great - cleans up great - quiet - nuff said

..

6006840060008 If you had asked me yesterday was I glad I chose the Breville over more expensive blenders, I'd have said yes without hesitation. I use it daily - many days 2 or more times. I make my own nut butters, smoothies (it liquifies greens perfectly), hummus, and even black bean truffles without a problem. The overload protection is a nice feature, as it's easy to let it run while doing other kitchen tasks - it shuts off after a minute of processing. It cleans up in a snap too. For less than 1/2 the price of the Vitamix, I have been thrilled. Until tonight when I plugged it in and it wouldn't turn on. After 8 months of use it's dead for no reason that I can see. Yes, it's still under warranty and we'll see what happens when I call them tomorrow. According to the warranty info on the site I may get a new or refurbished one in 14 days. That's just too long for me to go without a blender after spending $200 on one less than a year ago.

..

6006840060008 The automated ice crushing cycle created great crushed ice.
The bowl is made of a very sturdy material, both impact resistant, and dishwasher safe. Compare to Vitamix at half the price. Just the best blender I've ever purchsed.

..

6006840060008 While this is a great unit, it cost more than i am used to spending on blenders. It is great for doing smoothies (this is it primary use in my house)

..

6006840060008 I bought this to help prepare my husband's liquid diet. (Required after surgery). It is worth every penny. I always bought the cheaper blenders. They were a pain to clean, so I rarely used them. This one is easy to clean. And it does everything I need it to do. Liquefies all sorts of fruits and veggies. Food pours out without lots of it getting caught under the blades. I haven't tried crushing ice yet. That's next.

Enjoy hot coffee every morning with this coffeemaker that brews up to ten 5-oz. cups and features a fast 3-minute cycle so that your coffee always tastes fresh. A ready-to-brew reservoir keeps the water at the ideal brewing temperature.


..

6006840060008 This is our 4th Bunn coffee maker. They are functionally great, but only last a few years. Make sure that you take this into account when you buy one. At $100, they aren't cheap, but they make a really fast pot of coffee and look great. Remember to turn off the coffee maker while on vacation!

..

6006840060008 I love bunn coffee makers I have bought them the past 35 years they make a pot of coffee in three mins and it taste very good also.
I have family members and friends that we so impressed with my bunn that they also have went out and purchased bunn coffee makers.
They used to come with the water pitchers to fill the coffee maker and they do not have that anymore I still have one from about ten years ago that i still use because years ago as so as you put water in it started making coffee now they have the lids so it will not start brewing till you slide or put the lid down but I do not like to use the pot for measuring the water so I still use my old picher.

..

6006840060008 I wanted a good coffee maker, but didn't want to spend too much. This Bunn makes great tasting, smooth, coffee, even when I use cheap stuff. I love the speed at which I can brew a full pot of coffee. less than 4 minutes.

..

6006840060008 We love the fact it only takes 3 minutes to brew. I just had to buy our second coffee maker just like this one its been over 8 years since I bought the first one. All of the friends and families I know have had to replace theirs of the other brands. I'll keep my bunn. ALWAYS

..

6006840060008 I never knew how bitter my coffee was prior to having my Bunn. Taste is night and day, so smooth at the perfect drinking temperature. My only disappointment is that I cannot set a timer to brew in the morning before work, even through it only takes minutes to brew I still like it sitting and waiting for me... However the price and quality is so much better I forget about the extra few minutes it takes me in the morning with every tasty sip.

..

6006840060008 had the same kind before for 7 years. It worked great and kept the coffee hot. This new one does not !!!!!

..

6006840060008 Got for in home use. Brews a full pot of coffee in about 3 minutes. Flavor and quality is excellent however the cost is a bit higher than others. An aspect I didn't know before purchase is that for it to brew fast you must leave the unit on continuously (24/7) to heat the water. So I would only recommend this to someone that drinks coffee routinely. Have not noticed an increase in the electric bill yet. Unit is very nice looking on the counter top with just about any color scheme as it is black and stainless.

..

6006840060008 Best coffee maker ever. I own one, bought 1 for my Dad and this one was a gift. Holds whole pot of hot water, so when you want to make coffee....it brews instantly! No bad side. If you are a big coffee drinker....you need this!

..

6006840060008 I've always liked this style and the white color is so clean. Very dependable and brewing in 3 mins for 10 cups is perfect.

..

6006840060008 Overall it's a great coffe maker. The secret is the hot water always ready and the spray nozzle. I don't think it's going to last as long as our first Bunn coffe maker. That one lasted 5 years. There are also some sharp edges on the back that scrape the counter if your not careful. If you have the Bunn under a upper cabinet , to fill it you must pull it out and then put it back. We really scratched up our solid surface with our last one.
Still, it makes a great cup of coffe

BUNN HG-D Brewer - 8 Cup(s)


..

6006840060008 Only auto drip coffee maker approved by Specialty Coffee Association for under $200 (https://www.scaa.org/?page=cert2). You will notice a difference in your coffee, much smoother cup of joe. The water tank is above the filter basket and heats to the correct temp before showering the grinds, No problems with the pour spout, never missed a drip (see complaint from other review). I gave up on Cuisinart, they only lasted 3 years, tried a calphalon, it lasted 1 week and broke, then tried the fancy Sears model with the grinder (horrible machine) before I found the Bunn. Love this machine, finally a good cup without going to a French press.

..

6006840060008 It's awfully noisy... but makes good coffee when it works... sometimes doesn't cycle the water through and you have to shake it... ALWAYS drips when you pour (from the right or left), the pot and lid design is not very good... I've had other Bunn's, this isn't a good one

BUNN BX Brewer - 900W - 50fl oz - 10 Cup - White


..

6006840060008 would not buy anything else, these last forever. have tried other but don't come close as a bunn

..

6006840060008 Easy setup, solid foundation for stability, produces hot coffee in minutes, warmup period required but this is a necessary downside for a quality result, often difficult to determine how much water is in the reservoir.

..

6006840060008 This Bunn coffee maker is awesome. Good hot and tasteful coffee. It even can brew tea if you'd like. Just buy it. Have it working every day since 1/8/13, no problems at all.

..

6006840060008 
Coffee lovers will enjoy caf quality coffee brewed in 3 minutes with this 10-cup thermal coffeemaker. The patented sprayhead design and an internal thermostat improve coffee flavor extraction for an ideal cup of coffee every time.


..

6006840060008 When looking for a new coffee maker, I knew I wanted this model so I searched the internet. Best Buy, by far, had the best price and I liked the option of picking up at the store so I could choose the time and date. My husband is in charge of making the coffee and he LOVES this model. The coffee is hot, the right hot; the grounds are thoroughly saturated, giving the optimal flavor; it is automatic shutoff so we don't have to worry if the coffee maker is off; the coffee does not sit on a burner - thus, the operative word "burner". We don't have burnt tasting coffee. We LOVE this model. Can you tell?

..

6006840060008 very happy with purchase i turn on my, coffee maker go to bathroom in morning and BAAMMM. fresh coffee

..

6006840060008 Very happy with the coffee maker but the one downfall is the coffee doesn't stay hot long enough.

..

6006840060008 It is too big and the usage for electricity is a lot

..

6006840060008 I love the fact that you don't have to worry about breaking the decanter or leaving it on the burner without enough coffee in it. I also love how long it keeps the coffee hot! This decanter, even without the burner, keeps the coffee steaming hot for a good 2 or even 3 hours.

..

6006840060008 I have found this coffee maker to be great, the new pot doesn't leak and the coffee is hot and stays that way. Have found this maker to be worth every penny...

..

6006840060008 If you like hot coffee, this machine is not for you. If the water starts out at 200 degrees, it does not end up that way by the time it gets into the carafe. The more coffee you place in the filter, the less hot the coffee going into the carafe is. This product is definitely not worth the price. Actually, it's not worth the price even if it was free.

..

6006840060008 Easy to use. Fast coffee in less than 3 minutes as advertised. No hot plate to burn your coffee. No on and off switch except vacation. No worries about leaving the coffee pot on. Simple machine however expensive. I have not been experiencing carafe issues coffee hot after 3 hours in carafe.
No burnt coffee. Con......Not as attractive as other coffee makers and expensive. Only makes 10 cups. But good tasting 10 cups!

..

6006840060008 This coffee maker is awesome. It makes a pot very fast and the carafe does keep the coffee hot for about an hour. Very nice looking machine to have sitting on a counter also.

..

6006840060008 Would not buy any other brand. It is the best. Great price quick delivery. I shopped around for awhile the price was well worth the wait.

..

6006840060008 this is my 2nd bunn coffee maker in 11yrs. i wore my 1st one out.. and the stainless steel pot is great i can make coffee and set it on my table for company or on my desk while m at the pc... love my BUNN!!!

..

6006840060008 They always great coffee makers that last a long time.

..

6006840060008 My husband and I purchased this so that we can have coffee in a moments notice.

..

6006840060008 Throughout my working life in radio doing morning shows, I'm the guy who had to be awake to WAKE YOU UP in the mornings. I was fortunate enough to work at many radio stations that knew the value of having quality hot fresh coffee made very quickly (during commercial breaks) and Bunn was always the brand to trust. Being a coffee snob (which I'm not, but friends think I am) I love the fact that the Bunn is ALWAYS ready to pump a hot pot of water through whatever ground beans I put in the filter, but it saturates them with very hot water getting the most flavor and aroma in the minimal amount of time. NOTHING BEATS A BUNN.
By the way, I had the commercial models when I owned a restaurant. Woudn't ever have another brand on my counter at home or at work!

..

6006840060008 The best coffee maker I've ever owned! Not only does it brew a full pot in 3 minutes, if I'm not using it for a few days, I can turn the heating element off. It's ready in about 10 minutes when I'm ready to brew another pot.

..

6006840060008 Just purchased after discarding my 10th $30 Mr. Coffee drip brew. Everything is just as advertised. Coffee is extremely smooth without any bitterness. I like hot coffee and the advertised brew temp of 200 was appealing to me so I thought I would spend the extra money. Temperature in thermal carafe immediately after brewing was +180. After three hours it was 165. After 12 which you would probably never do it was still over 120. I did follow the instructions and preheated the carafe with hot tap water for a couple of minutes. Was told that these last for 20 years - hope this is the case.

The cbtl americano from the coffee bean and tea leaf. Makes fast, fresh and flavorful espresso, coffee or tea.


..

6006840060008 I am so glad I bought this CBTL machine on a lark swayed by the good reviews and recommendations, and since it could also make espresso. I figured we could make more caf style drinks. And the price was good. After 6 months I can say we are well pleased with the quality of this coffeemaker and continue to enjoy it like the first week we had it. No other machine I know of on the current market makes espresso, coffee, and tea from a capsule so well. It takes up little space yet has a huge water tank. I have given one as a shower gift and another as a Christmas present. They love them as well.

The optical FunMouse is sized just right for your child's little hand with color-coded left and right buttons.

..

6006840060008 Love this for my kids!!!! My kids love it too. In fact, the whole family uses it.

..

6006840060008 I bought this for my kids and they love it!! Every house in America should own one, I am so happy Best Buy is finally offering something for everyone, rather than just the bland, black or white keyboards. The mouse is great too, and small for kid's hands.

..

6006840060008 
The KinderBoard is an excellent first keyboard with large, 1 inch square keys and easy-to-read numbers and letters. Consonants, vowels, numbers and punctuation marks are color-coded to help pre-school children learn their alphabet and identify character sets.


..

6006840060008 I never write reviews, but jsut couldn't resist this time. I have three keyboards at home much like this one called the Kinderboard from Chester Creek. The first two were junk (BigKeys and Caliphone) - quit after a few months or just didnt work like they said. I know, a keyboard is a keyboard, but the Kinderboard is much more. It is built like a tank, the coloring is smart (for teaching my grandchildren both their alphabet and how to type) and the keys are almost 1" so their small fingers can hunt and peck for hours. I love this keyboard. Thanks Best Buy for taking care of grandpa and his grandchildren.

Capture photos and videos of specimens with this Celestron Infiniview 44360 LCD digital microscope, which features a 5.0MP digital camera with 10x magnification, so you can take crisp, detailed shots. The battery-powered design enables on-the-go use.


..

6006840060008 Bought for my husband to use with his coin collection. He looks for finite stamping errors on coins and it was too hard to see things with tradtional hand held magnifiers. This electronic scope lets him look at those finite details easily and he can snap a digital picture of the coin to save or share as needed. This has been worth the investment.

..

6006840060008 Excellent microscope with easy-to-use controls even for a novice. The only thing missing is a movable stage, which would help with slide viewing. Otherwise a great instrument, well-made with solid parts and construction.

Celestron Accessory Kit


..

6006840060008 It took me a LOT of thinking before buying "any eyepiece kit" for my Telescope.
I am completely new in the field (amateur astronomer) so my lack of knowledge probably leads me to "wishing for better image".
I am using it with my Celestron CPC800 and I was expecting to see those amazing close up images, but as you go with more magnification it becomes extremely difficult to focus an object. Jupiter looks spectacular, I easily see up to 5 of its biggest moons with a low magnification eye piece. I can also see the stripes where the "Big red spot" is located. I cannot see the Jovian Rings, but as I read one requires a rather LARGE telescope to be able to see them.
I am uploading a picture of Jupiter. Don't let it mislead you as I don't know yet how to take pictures where you can see what you really see thru the Eyepieces. The picture looks rather "black and white" but thru the eyepieces you can see colors.
Basically, for the price you pay, I believe is a great starting kit. You can grow later as you acquire more knowledge and know which exact eye piece you want.

..

6006840060008 I recently purchased a Celestron Omni XLT 150 and wanted a variety of lenses and filters to use with my new telescope. The kit gave me a variety of lenses with a wide range of options. I was extremely happy with the quality of optics.

..

6006840060008 not a bad set of ep's for the price, but definitely worth the money. perfect for people new to the hobby

..

6006840060008 The included eyepieces with beginner telescopes are very poor quality glass and usually have very little eye relief. These eyepieces have decent eye relief. While there are certainly higher quality eyepieces available, these give you excellent bang for the buck for any sub-$500 telescope, and would suffice for sub-$1000 scopes. The included 2x Barlow is the secret sauce of this package as a good Barlow is 1/3 the cost of this kit. The Celestron 8-24mm zoom lens is an excellent alternative if you only want one eyepiece. You don't get the range of zoom that this kit provides or the clarity of fixed eyepieces, but it is very convenient to have just one eyepiece for casual viewing.

..

6006840060008 This router would have to be reset every time the power went off, it would not reset itself. Sometimes this involved calling Linksys, and dealing with all of those, not so great English speaking people. Linksys tech and customer service, in my opinion, is a 3 on a scale of 1 to 10. This router only lasted 1.5 years before the firmware quit working. I spent hours on the phone with customer service over 1.5 years trying to repair this thing. Finally they said the firmware was bad, and they would give me a $15 rebate. That was one 30 days ago, and I'm still waiting(And calling every two weeks) Do not buy this router, it's not reliable, and not very easy to use for the novice.

..

6006840060008 I have had this router for about a year now and router management has become a nightmare. When I first bought this router you were able to simply log on to it like every other router and manage it by just going to the IP address. I was able to configure it and manage my LAN with no issues. The wifi signal it puts out is reliable and fast and allows me to use the internet for the most part. Ethernet connections are fast, but if you have to many devices connected the entire network can stop working until you unplug a device or two. I have found that 5 devices using LAN or Wifi at the same time can lead to this.
A year later and router management has become impossible. Now you are no longer allowed access to the router by just putting in the IP in a web browser. You must go to a website to manage your router. There is a local access button on the web site, but either way I am unable to log into the router to perform any kind of management on it because it hangs on a loading screen. So much for being able to manage my router or check router settings on my desktop connected to the very router that Im try to manage.
They have apps for android\iphone as well. Sadly both apps are worthless as I can log on to the router, but it says no devices are connected. Never mind that the ipad that the app is running on is connected to the router via wifi and has connected to the router via the app. The one thing I can do is reset the router password for wifi.
I would not recommend this router to anyone because you cannot manage any of the settings on it. This is a shame, because the wifi is pretty reliable. But since you cant even see who has access to your network in settings or change other network settings it is not user friendly. The one setting it seems to be able to do is reset the wifi password if you use the smartphone app. But that assumes your even able to get it to work the first time you hook it up to your LAN.

..

6006840060008 This remains the best Linksys of many I have owned over the years!
Well worth the price. You DO get what you PAY for with Cisco and Linksys 4200!

..

6006840060008 I am very well versed in networking and wireless technology. The claims that are made by the manufacturer are not delivered by the product. The speed is all over the map as in not consistent. It constantly drops the connection. Mine constantly tries to revert to the guest connection when it drops the primary connection. The only time it is even partly reliable is if you are in the same room as the router. Even then, there are connection problems. There needs to be major firmware improvements. I hope the company makes them. I really wouldn't recommend to buy this product at this time. I am very disappointed.

..

6006840060008 Nice extended range...powerful router!
Very useful if you need wireless internet in a large house/office

..

6006840060008 I had been using a WRT54GL v1.1 Linksys router for about 3 years. It is an 802.11g router and has been rock solid since the day I bought it. I expected the same from the e4200v2, as I assumed it would be of the same (Cisco) Linksys quality that I had experienced with my current router. I did some research and read some of the editorial reviews, and believed the e4200v2 to be a top of the line router. I was sadly mistaken.
I am somewhat of a power user, but, I suspect, that most people looking at this router would be since it has a higher price point and feature set. The hardware specification for this router are great (one of the best on the market), but the firmware is so buggy and the GUI so limiting and such a kludge that it cripples the e4200v2's functionality. When connected, I was getting very impressive throughput and range. The physical design is also very sleek, but I would still prefer external antennae.
To begin with, the web GUI interface is horrible. Linksys recommends using the Connect software, but it is even worse and limiting. There is no logout feature in the web GUI, which I believe is a security issue, and some of the advanced settings are hidden (as in, you have to manually type in the address in the browser's address bar to get to them).
The DHCP client table, which I believe is essential for network status monitoring, is not reliable. Sometimes it doesn't list devices that I can verify are connected to the network. It will also list devices that are not currently connected to the network, which would be fine if there were a connected devices list (which it does not have).
Two 802.11g devices I own would not connect to the e4200v2 if any type of wireless security was enabled. The two devices in question connected fine to a friend's 802.11n router, so I thought it may be a setting on the router. I checked online in the forums and talked with Linksys tech support and neither had a solution. Linksys blamed the devices even though they were connecting fine to two other routers (my old g router and my friend's n router). I also have one 802.11n device that would sporadically disconnect and reconnect to the router (was not a range issue, as I was 20 feet line-of-sight from the router and had excellent signal strength when connected).
There are also several features that I believe a router at this price point should have:
1) Connected devices list with signal strength (mentioned above).
2) Bandwidth monitoring and logging.
3) More extensive DDNS service list.
4) Non-hidden advanced wireless settings tab.
5) Site survey feature, so you can see neighboring network channels.
I did not try any of the media or USB features, as I was so frustrated with the other issues I returned it to Best Buy within a week of purchase.
I would have actually considered keeping the e4200v2 if I had some reassurance that Cisco would fix the firmware in a timely manner. However, the router had the latest firmware, version 2.0.36, which according to the Linksys website was released 01/04/12, so it doesn't look like Linksys is too much of a hurry to fix theses issues. Had I done more research before buying, I would have seen people having similar issues on the Linksys forum. The fact that no one from Linksys has responded to any of those discussions on the forum makes me question even more the priority of this flagship product.
In conclusion, I think this router has great potential, but until they fix the firmware issues, I would stay away from this thing unless you have all newer 802.11n devices and don't mind the other limitations that I listed.

6006840060008 Purchased in Aug 2011 and now in June 2012, it no longer works. To be fair, it is used on long road trips at least once a month and also for about an hour a day, five days a week as my son commutes with me to attend day care. It's been used heavily and for the low price, I think getting a year out of it is not bad.

6006840060008 I like it if I am just carrying my Mac Book Pro laptop, but using it for what it was intended, laptop and iPad together, the bag is tight and leaves me feeling insecure about dropping it. There isn't much padding inside the bag. But, it is outstanding in size and carrying.

Imagine, preserve, enhance your digital media


..

6006840060008 I bought this after getting a new computer with Windows 8 because the older Roxio version wasn't supposed to work properly with Windows 8. After using it for a week, I started having the same problems that I had with the older Roxio version. I burn a lot of DVD's and I could get it to work about half of the time until a few days ago when it rendered itself useless. Either it comes up with errors before burning or it burns the disc and then when I put it in to play it, it says that the disc cannot be played. A company that doesn't offer support for their products is a company that everyone should stay away from. They don't even give you a way to try to get in touch with them.

6006840060008 Purchased to mount a 32" tv in the bedroom, it was easy to install between my father and I, had it up within about 30 minutes and its great having the tv on the wall now. No concerns with weight.

..

6006840060008 Everything is worth it for this inexpensive unit but the 15% tilt.If you don't need it to tilt that much,mount it a little bit lower than anticipated,otherwise you will find that it doesn't point down as much as you may want it to.

You probably already know that solid-state drives are fast. With up to 85,000 IOPS and read speeds of up to 555Mb/s, Force Series GT is on another level. There's fast, and then there's fast. Force Series 3 SSDs have even quicker read and write times when they're installed in PCs that use the latest SATA 3 6Gb/s interface.


..

6006840060008 Very Good Upgrade to Sony Laptop!!!!
ExcellentPurchase

..

6006840060008 Purchased this using a gift card from Best Buy, price is a little higher than other retailers. SSD is every bit as fast I as I had hoped! Would order this brand again if I need one!

..

With a 120GB storage capacity, this Corsair Force Series GT internal Serial ATA III solid state drive provides ample space to accommodate your media. Read speeds up to 555MB/sec. and write speeds up to 515MB/sec. offer fast data transfer.


..

6006840060008 Gives me a windows rating of 7.9. Great speed, super easy to install.

..

6006840060008 I've had the Force GT hard drive for about a month and a half now, and I haven't noticed any issues with it thus far. A build-your-own-computer user will find it easy to install, and the performance is obviously better compared to my old Raptor 10000RPM.
I have not completed a benchmark test on the machine, but I have noticed Windows 7 fully loads all services from the push of the power button in about 25-30 seconds. Seeing how much available hard drive space I have now, I probably could have purchased a smaller size since I also have internal data drive (or for those of you who backup your data to the cloud). I primarily use the hard drive for gaming, and I haven't noticed any lag or load time issues before, during, or after gaming sessions.

..

6006840060008 I will buy this Brand again for my next hard drive upgrade.

..

6006840060008 Its a great SSD, seems reliable and I have had no trouble at all with it, its fast and doubles batterly life. The ony thing is that 120 gigabytes might seem enough but if you are using it for your primary Hard Drive and have no other storage drive it wont be enough.

..

6006840060008 This is my third SSD (two are in my tower and this one is for my laptop). I'd previously bought an OCZ Vertex 3 which I love and get 450mbs read/write. I really wanted another of those but didn't have the funds and fretted a great deal over this purchase. I shouldn't have worried. This drive is just as good and just as fast. It was super easy to install and I'm getting 560/510mbs read/write.
Get one.
PS. Installed it into my Asus G75VW gaming laptop.

..

6006840060008 This is the only SSD I have used so I cannot compare to others. Any operation that is disk heavy like booting or moving files is faster. Regular operations like surfing the web there is no difference.
My system boot time went from about 15 seconds to two seconds from hitting the start button to the desktop.
The drive is good for a laptop because it uses less power and is cooler. For a desktop I don't think it will make as much a difference because boot time is the main difference. I doubt it will have much effect on games. And I always use sleep mode any way so that doesn't matter. Also the price for the size on SSDs is still high.

..

6006840060008 mouse is real comfortable, I have more of slender, long hand and this mouse fits perfect... only time the sniper button is a problem is if my hand slides down it a bit.
If you can buy this mouse!!

..

6006840060008 The mouse is great and it changes the experience of playing your FPS completely. Now I can get a lot more head-shots than previously because of the Sniper button.
I got to play in 3 Operative Systems (2 versions of ubuntu and Win 7) and it worked smoothly on all of them!
I love my new mouse!
Totally recommended. (It is my first mouse of this kind)

..

6006840060008 It also has two buttons on the side i dever realized until a few days ago. So yeahl. It works. I recommend it if youre looking for a nice mouse. It is could for playing first person shooter games or whatevs. I also recommend dayz to play ;) its coo.

..

6006840060008 This mouse is great. Excellent control and feel. Aluminum body so you know its tough. The sides have a sort of grippy texture which i like. The dpi toggle buttons can be customized to do other things. The only thing I dont like is that the sniper button is too far forward. Even with a large sized hand, I have to completely wrap my entire hand around the mouse and stretch my thumb to reach the button. Not a huge inconvenience but it is annoying that its not right where i need it to be

..

6006840060008 This is a solid 9.5/10 mouse for me. I have tried lots of mouse like the deathadder, intellimouse, g500, g5, naga, and the xai. I could not find any mouse that I really enjoy until this baby. Side note: The sniper logo on the sniper button got wiped away down to 15% left of the mark just from using it, not sure if it bothers you but it is odd.

..

6006840060008 I just started playing computer games again with the release of Battlefield 3. At first I was using a basic MS optical mouse, then switched to a Razer Deathadder for more sensitivity, and finally ended up switching to the Corsair M60. This thing has helped me go from the bottom of the leaderboard to about 3/4 of the way up and sometimes even First :) The sniper button is key - it drops your DPI to whatever you set it at (mine is at 200 dpi). This allows you to make more headshots from further away due to more accurate scoping. I highly recommend this product... I'm temped to try out the K60 keyboard now. I used the software once to program buttons, and haven't had any issues.

..

6006840060008 Now, let me start by saying that a 5700 DPI mouse for less than $80 is a fantastic buy for anyone with that much money to begin with. Honestly, if you need a mouse this sensitive, there is no reason to spend too much more on something else.
The only REAL complaints I have are that my big hands don't quite fit. It's hard to explain, but basically, in order for my thumb to be in the right position for the buttons, my fingers need to hang over the edge of the left and right buttons. Other than this, all the hardware features are well thought-out and solidly built, and ALL of the buttons can be re-programmed by the software.
SPEAKING OF WHICH! The software, in essence, WAS broken when I first got the mouse (about 1 month before posting). That's not to say that the disk was broken (there was none), it means that it plain didn't work as intended. That said, it didn't, and still doesn't, interfere with virtually anything.
The software now has a public beta version for both the M60 and it's sister the M90 that actually does work, and I am pleased to report that it really does make the mouse a must buy. However, it's not easy to find the new beta software, and the V1 software was SO bad, I can't help but note it in my "compatibility" section.
Overall, if you can get used to it's unique shape, and find the right version of the software online, this might just be the best $70 you ever spend on PC hardware.

..

6006840060008 We purchased this item to place in my 4 year old son's room. It worked great during the night, just like we hoped it would. This week, after just under three weeks of use, the tank cracked and is completely unusable. I contacted the manufacturer, Crane, to let them know what happened and how disappointment I was in the quality of item, especially since it was intended for use by children. The response I got back was simply a link to the replacement parts available for order on their website, with no mention of the actual reason I contacted them. I purchased the replacement tank, as that was my only option, but emailed them back letting them know I was now also disappointed in their level of quality service as well. I also noticed that although you can make purchases on their website, there is no ability to leave reviews. This was definitely a One and Done purchase of a Crane product.

..

6006840060008 I would recommend this product to any parent interested in changing the humidity in a room. It's easy to set up and portable. It's one gallon size takes up some room, but if you already have kids that kind of comes with the commitment. Definitely use distilled water as it will cut down on buildup of scale.

6006840060008 My wife and I brought this, because she's been decorating the house with an oriental theme, and a red dragon would go well with the rest of the decor. We're amazed at how good this humidifier is, and how long it lasts. While I'm away at work during the day, I leave the humidifier in the living room, and put it in the room before going to sleep. I change the water in it once in the morning, leave it at a medium setting, and it doesn't empty out until the next morning! That to me is awesome!
My wife and I are used to a more tropical weather, so we've been cranking up the heat in the winter, and needless to say, we've both been sleeping way better with the humidifier.

..

6006840060008 Did what it's supposed to do. It is easy to maintain.

..

6006840060008 The humidifier was very easy to put together and fill. Is very easy to use. One "fill" can last over 10 hours (I've never tried to let it fully run out, though).

..

6006840060008 Very good item. It's easy to clean and to take parts apart. The cool mist helps me and my wife sleep better during the nightime.

..

6006840060008 Bought fir my sons nursery and works great, we love it!!

..

6006840060008 Works good but the mist looks the same no matter where I set the adjustment knob. Only way to get the mist low is to turn the knob slowly till it just starts to produce mist. Otherwise the mist doesn't seem to adjust. Does produce white coating on furniture with my tap water, had to use filtered water. Make sure to empty/wipe daily, it gets slimy quickly.

..

6006840060008 Since I have been using this humidifier, I no longer have the dry mouth symptoms. It is quiet, and once I fill it with water, it lasts the whole night. Well worth the $50.

..

6006840060008 I've returned this humidifier to best buy to get a new one 3 times. They would spontaneously stop working. I give up. I am currently looking for one that can last more than a year

..

6006840060008 I have had the humidifier running on low for the past three days and only topped off the tank once. I have not tried on a higher setting to see how fast it runs out. As soon as you put the tank of water on and crank up the setting, it starts to work.

..

6006840060008 I was having nosebleeds from the dry, warm air in our apartment during the winter. My doctor told me to get a humidifier to use. After doing research on the internet I found out that our local Best Buy had this one in stock. It has helped tremendously and is very reasonably priced. There is a re-filling and also a weekly cleaning routine to follow, but I am very pleased with my purchase.

6006840060008 Great product. I've had a few humidifiers and this is my favorite. Very quiet,don't hear it running. no messy filters to clean or replace.

Otherwise the mist doesn't seem to adjust. Does produce white coating on furniture with my tap water, had to use filtered water. Make sure to empty/wipe daily, it gets slimy quickly.

..

6006840060008 Since I have been using this humidifier, I no longer have the dry mouth symptoms. It is quiet, and once I fill it with water, it lasts the whole night. Well worth the $50.

..

6006840060008 I've returned this humidifier to best buy to get a new one 3 times. They would spontaneously stop working. I give up. I am currently looking for one that can last more than a year

..

6006840060008 I have had the humidifier running on low for the past three days and only topped off the tank once. I have not tried on a higher setting to see how fast it runs out. As soon as you put the tank of water on and crank up the setting, it starts to work.

..

6006840060008 I was having nosebleeds from the dry, warm air in our apartment during the winter. My doctor told me to get a humidifier to use. After doing research on the internet I found out that our local Best Buy had this one in stock. It has helped tremendously and is very reasonably priced. There is a re-filling and also a weekly cleaning routine to follow, but I am very pleased with my purchase.

..

6006840060008 Great product. I've had a few humidifiers and this is my favorite. Very quiet,don't hear it running. no messy filters to clean or replace.

Keep cool with this Crane EE-5607 oscillating tower fan, which features 3 speeds for customizable settings and a multifunction control panel that helps simplify operation. The included remote allows you to control the fan from a distance.


..

6006840060008 Looks great in the pic, but in person craftsman ship and materials feel very cheap. PIcture makes it look as if its entirely covered in stainless steel when it actually is only one slab covering about 1/3 of the tower. But worst of all the highest setting for the fan is barely a wavering blow not strong enough to blow out a candle. Returning at my earliest convenience.

Crane Owl Cool Mist Humidifier - Cool Mist, Ultrasonic - 1 gal - 2.10 gal/Day - 250 Sq. ft.


..

6006840060008 We purchased this Item for our 2yr old daughter. It was unfortunate we woke up to soaking carpet and furniture. Even after moving it to 3 different locations and all 3 times soaking carpet.
So, we returned it.
BTW: No ceiling fan were on during the time it was being used.

..

6006840060008 Inexpensive, works well, cute. What else needs to be said?

..

6006840060008 this was perfect for my granddaughters owl decorated room. she is too young to use medications for allergies and sinus so a cool mist humitifier is a life saver to sleep soundly.

Crane POLAR BEAR Cool Mist Humidifier - Cool Mist, Ultrasonic - 1 gal - 2.10 gal/Day - 250 Sq. ft. - 32 W


..

6006840060008 nice design, looks good in the kid's room. humidifies the air as described in the product listing. why don't they make reservoirs that fill themselves? :)

..

6006840060008 My kids are loving it because of frog character. It does good job for kids small room

..

6006840060008 It is easy to clean and operate.
No noise when operating

..

6006840060008 We purchased this item to place in my 4 year old son's room. It worked great during the night, just like we hoped it would. This week, after just under three weeks of use, the tank cracked and is completely unusable. I contacted the manufacturer, Crane, to let them know what happened and how disappointment I was in the quality of item, especially since it was intended for use by children. The response I got back was simply a link to the replacement parts available for order on their website, with no mention of the actual reason I contacted them. I purchased the replacement tank, as that was my only option, but emailed them back letting them know I was now also disappointed in their level of quality service as well. I also noticed that although you can make purchases on their website, there is no ability to leave reviews. This was definitely a One and Done purchase of a Crane product.

..

6006840060008 I would recommend this product to any parent interested in changing the humidity in a room. It's easy to set up and portable. It's one gallon size takes up some room, but if you already have kids that kind of comes with the commitment. Definitely use distilled water as it will cut down on buildup of scale.

..

6006840060008 This humidifier works really well. I would recommend it.

..

6006840060008 Really cute. Kids love it.
Does its job for one small room
Satisfied with this product

..

6006840060008 I would recommend this product to anyone with kids or without works great!

..

6006840060008 I bought this for my cousin who was expecting her first baby. Their nursery theme is elephants. They love this product. It is perfect for their new bundle of joy. Light weight, reasonable size, and great price.

..

6006840060008 My wife and I brought this, because she's been decorating the house with an oriental theme, and a red dragon would go well with the rest of the decor. We're amazed at how good this humidifier is, and how long it lasts. While I'm away at work during the day, I leave the humidifier in the living room, and put it in the room before going to sleep. I change the water in it once in the morning, leave it at a medium setting, and it doesn't empty out until the next morning! That to me is awesome!
My wife and I are used to a more tropical weather, so we've been cranking up the heat in the winter, and needless to say, we've both been sleeping way better with the humidifier.

The Creative D100 is a modern day boombox which delivers wireless audio from any of your Bluetooth-enabled wireless devices. It opens a whole world of possibilities unbound by wires and blends harmoniously into any environment, be it music sharing at the skate park or impromptu partying at the beach. You can even listen to music from non-wireless MP3 players via the integrated AUX-in port.


..

6006840060008 Two things: first, this speaker needs to be plugged in to an outlet, so the speaker itself is not too "portable". It's for people like me, who want the SOURCE (like my tablet) to be portable. Second, I've gotten one in the store on sale for 35 dollars and one for 50 at regular price, so buy it in the store instead of online.
Anyhow, I keep the speaker in my kitchen (somewhat central in my house) and it rocks. Great sound, I believe two 3" drivers and ported. Easy to hook up.
I'd recommend this product enough that I've bought it twice- one for my wife and one for Father's Day for my Dad.

..

6006840060008 I was searching for an iPad dock but nothing really stood out, so I started looking for bluetooth options for speakers. Using bluetooth technology, this can connect not only to my iPad but also to my phone, iPod touch and laptop. The sound it fantastic, of course I don't expect THX theater quality, but it is loud and clear enough for my bedroom and the occasional outdoor party. It can run on batteries, so portability is great. Also, it looks great!

6006840060008 Creative really did it. I purchased this card same day I took it back. When you talk on the microphone there is delay echo therefore you can not say a word because it confuses the person...And creative does not have answer for it.. Stay away from this product

6006840060008 Sound like 1970's quality, very low sound. No regular electric power cable, USB power only. I can't setup the wireless speaker far away from power source. It doesn't make sense to buy this product. I don't want anyone to get the same mistake I did. I rate this product 1 star generously. I returned it next day.

The Crock-Pot Cook & Carry Slow Cooker is an easier way to take your slow cooked meal on the road. The easy locking lid with rubber gasket will help you get to your final destination without making a mess. Features removable dishware safe stoneware, 6 quart capacity and stainless steel finish to compliment any decor.


..

6006840060008 I love this crockpot. It is a perfect starter for a new kitchen or small family. The suction/lock down kid makes it ideal for transportation to parties, events, or back to the refrigerator.

..

6006840060008 I have wanted one for a long time so when Best Buy decided to offer it for $19.99 I jumped at it. This Crock Pot is easy to set up, (not much to do), easy to use, and seems to be very durable. It is worth it getting one.

..

6006840060008 I love cooking now with this crock pot. I am new to using crock pots and did not enjoy cooking until now!

..

6006840060008 This is a great slow cooker and was priced at a bargin.

..

6006840060008 We use the crockpot at least once a week. It has made countless gallons of soups and chili. Has yet to have dinner ready ok time. It's the perfect size to complement any kitchen or chef no latter the experience level. Highly recommended

..

6006840060008 I bought this crock pot online and had broken the glass insert.Went online to find a replacement insert and found for just a few dollars more I could buy another new one, so I bought it .while waiting for the shipment to arrive Wal-Mart ran a sale on one that was a 7 quart ,this one was a 6 quart for less money same brand .Knowing best buy price match guild line wouldn't match the price I bought it from Wal-mart .this is a great crock pot

..

6006840060008 I have had my crockpot for less then two months. It was very easy to use. Recently the bowl crackec and I will be retudning it. I would have never thought that would happen so easily, but luckily I purchased a replacement plan.

..

6006840060008 Great buy for the price! Heats up pretty quickly. Easy to use.

..

6006840060008 Our old Rival 6qt Crockpot met its demise after falling off the counter and making an abrupt landing on the kitchen floor. The controller knob snapped off. It was more than 20 years old. This new one is oval and holds 6qts. No bells and whistles, just a basic high-low-off crockpot. It does a better job with whole chickens, turkey breasts and vegetables than our old round one. Feeds 6 easy, with a few leftovers for lunch the next day. I'm looking forward to many years of use.

..

6006840060008 This slow cooker is great for everything: chili, barbecue, roasts, etc. It's easy to clean and was on clearance at my local best buy.

..

6006840060008 
Slow cooking in your Crock-Pot Slow Cooker provides you the flexibility to prepare a meal early and then have it cook all day. You can carry out your full day's activities and still enjoy a nutritious, home-cooked meal in the evening. It's a healthier, more cost-efficient and convenient way to serve tasty, satisfying meals. This modern, stylish slow cooker with flat digital panel uses programmable cook settings on HIGH with 4 or 6-hour selections and LOW with 8 or 10-hour selections to conveniently cook around your schedule. After cooking time is complete, the Smart-Pot Slow Cooker will automatically shift to WARM setting to keep food at ideal serving temperature.


..

6006840060008 The way it was worded, it gives you the impression that you could change cooking temperatures during the cooking process. Like set on high for 2 hours and then have it go to low for 4 hours. After cooking time, then it goes to warm.
It will not do this. Or we cannot figure out how. Very disappointing. I was excited, as I like to start all my slow cooking on high and then down to low to finish it up. I thought what a handy way to have it do it on it's own. Only reason I bought this.

Crucial Adrenaline 50 GB 3.5" Internal Solid State Drive - SATA


..

6006840060008 I was a bit worried after reading reviews from other sites on this product but I was pleasantly suprised when the setup and installation went so easily. My home built over clocked quad-core loads windows and everything else at least four times faster than before. The SSD installs just like any other hard drive and my machine recoginized it right away. I went to the crucial.com website, entered my code, downloaded the software and rebooted. The second time I booted it went from the log in screen to completely loading my home screen with everything on it within 30 seconds. This product works exactly as advertised.

Whip up delicious dishes easily with this Cuisinart Advantage 5511-BK cookware set that features 11 pieces, including saucepans, skillet and more. The aluminum core ensures even heating, while the nonstick finish provides easy food release.


..

6006840060008 it's just a great set. the interior has a nice nonstick coating. the lids fit nice and i love the heat resistant handles..

..

6006840060008 I had earlier purchases of Cuisinart, but this one i like the most. good nonstick reliability

..

6006840060008 i enjoy cooking with this set, non stick is great.

..

6006840060008 Im in love with my new cookware set ....They are all I use now...

..

6006840060008 i bougt this item on christmas sale and i think it was a good deal.

..

6006840060008 I am very glad I bought this set. The color is wonderful, and the quality is very high! Quality non stick cookware.

..

6006840060008 Cuisinart is a well known name so I expected this cookware set to be of good quality, really be non-stick, and be visually appealing. And I got exactly what I bargained for. The RED color cookware gives the kitchen a pop versus the traditional black or titanium colors. I'd recommend that other people purchase this cookware set. Thus far I haven't had it for very long but so far so good.

..

6006840060008 These pans perform as described; nothing sticks to them and they are very easy to wash!

..

6006840060008 Great price . wonderful looking . love them ......

..

6006840060008 My wife has really enjoyed using these pots and pans since we purchased them. We previously had pretty outdated and mismatched items, so this has been a very welcome upgrade. She likes how the surfaces of all the items feel, and thinks they will last a very long time.

Cook your favorite soup at home with this soup maker that features a 48-oz. hot liquid and 56-oz. cold liquid capacity. The 4 blending speeds and 3 heat settings allow you to control how your soup is made.


..

6006840060008 This machine broke the first week during use. It sounded cheap, looks cheap, plastic gears and components. Disappointed with Cuisinart.

..

6006840060008 No Recipe book to help you use the the applicable dials and buttons. The manual explains the features but it would help if there were recipes to apply. Chops good for smoothies, I will test to see if it will make almond butter, cashew butter, However, it's difficult to clean the blades unless you remove from jar. The rubber gasket looks like it will take on mold after awhile, I will continue to check for that. I chopped garlic and the insides smelled until I allowed it to set in bleach and water. The drawback is that you can't immerse the jar in water to clean. Jar is heavy.

..

6006840060008 Its a great idea. Being able to make blend and heat soups and other dishes in one unit. Units such as the Thermomix and others have successgully done it for many years around the world. So when I noticed this 2013 product at Best Buy with a 3 year warranty I thought it was a safe bet. I was wrong. After 3 normal everyday uses of my machine it stopped blending. The motor in the blender does not appear to be powerful enough for the job it was intended to do. It struggled to blend from the moment I got it of the box. I am currently trying to get it fixed underwarranty. The Cuisinart warranty is not worth anything. They dodge and duck, hinder and avoid to ensure that it will cost you more in the end to get it fixed than the products worth.

..

6006840060008 Purchased it and thought it would be nice for making soup (that is what it is sold for). We had particularly bad luck. It is slower than a crock pot and will scorch thick soup also. Good ides but POOR design

..

6006840060008 After reading the great review in ShopSmart magazine, I thought I would give it a try. We made one of the soup recipes from the booklet enclosed with the blender. It was just average tasting. Then, I tried a sauce, same result. An immersion hand held blender would do the same job with less clean up.
We love to make smoothies in our house, but I was disappointed that it took several attempts to completely liquefy the frozen strawberries or any other frozen fruit we tried out.
I really had high hopes for this dual purpose blender, but may end up returning it.

..

6006840060008 The soup maker feature is really getting a workout around our house. It is amazing how quickly it churns out soup for my wife and I. There is a recipe booklet with it and it is nice but wayyyyyy too small. Need more soup recipes!

..

6006840060008 This heated blender by Cuisinart is genius! First of all, it still functions as a normal blender for cold blending. But, giving it a dual purpose to include soup and sauce making...well, who wouldn't want that!? I have been using my blender for almost a year now, so I have gone through all the seasons and used it for smoothies and soups. Now that the Fall season is officially back, I have already gotten back to making warm, savory soups, and my kids have been requesting their favorite hot chocolate. They no longer want the pre-packaged kind...they want it made in the Soup maker and blender using milk, cocoa powder, and chocolate chips. Sometimes I add a drop of peppermint, or orange extract to give it a different "twist"! Using this product for soup making is so simple. It has a "stir" function if you want a more chunky consistency. The soups come out perfect...and there are a lot of soup recipes out there, so the sky is the limit! It comes with a basic recipe book to get you started, but really, you can create your own with ease, once you get a feel for the ratio of liquid/veggies etc. that are needed. Soup is so good for you, and it's a way for me to get some veggies into my kids! Add some crusty bread or biscuits with it and you have a simple meal for your family! I have made cream of brocolli, creamy tomato-basil, carrot/curry, French onion, Asparagus, Potato...all have turned out delicious! It's kind of like the story from Stone Soup...you probably ALWAYS have things on hand in your pantry or in the fridge, in a pinch, to throw in and make a delicious soup. Give this a try...you won't be disappointed! Makes a great gift too!

Cuisinart's 4-Cup Coffeemaker is now available with a stainless steel carafe. It's compact enough to use for a small household or second home. Automatic shut-off after 30 minutes, so there is no need to worry when you leave the house in a hurry.


..

6006840060008 Good purchase.The heating portion gets dirty and starts peeling with spills. It is stainless steel goes well with the other kitchen appliances and is durable

..

6006840060008 I love coffee, and I'm always looking for a great coffee maker. This one is perfect because of the steel jar. It does not break when I wash it, and it last forever.

..

6006840060008 sturdy, makes two great cups of coffee. but i dawdle between cups and when i go back for the second cup the unit has shut off, requiring reheating in microwave. could make one cup at a time, but seems
like a waste of filters, and time

..

6006840060008 I think it looks great compared to the all white makers or clear carafes but i dont leave mine out when im not using it, but if i ever did it matches my stainless steel appliances great ... any way i have a plug near my sink so i just use my faucet to fill the coffee maker up with water and it works perfect for me ... after the coffee is made i just pour it slow into my mug and it does not leak, if you pour to fast or tilt it to far when it is filled with coffee, it does leak out the seam but most 4 cup carafes do that ... just pour slow ... it makes great coffee for me and then i just rinse out the carafe when im done and put it away ... the only issue is for ALL 4 cup makers is that they use 6 oz as 1 cup and most mugs are 12 oz or even larger so you need to understand you are gonna get 2 mug fulls of coffee

..

6006840060008 This coffeemaker is perfect for my tiny NYC-size kitchen. With limited counter space, this coffeemaker is perfect. I've had it about a month and it works perfectly.

..

6006840060008 This is the worst design I could imagine. It's like the manufacturer must not have even tried it out before selling it!!! The carafe design is horrible. It is impossible to pour water or coffee without spilling it everywhere! The water seems to spill out between the rim of the carafe and the carafe. There's a mess to clean up after filling the resavoir and after pouring coffee. It is also hard to fill the resavoir because the lid doesn't open wide enough.
I would have returned this after the first use if I hadn't have thrown the box away without trying it. Big mistake!

..

6006840060008 Using a normal coffee cup only makes about 1.5 cups. Top of carafe is hard to get off. When pouring water into coffee maker, unless you hold the top down when pouring water leaks down the side of the carafe all over counter. Very disappointed. I got it as a gift so I didn't dish out any money for it which was good.

..

6006840060008 The automatic shut off is a great feature. Nice coffee
maker for the price.
One little flaw is the black paint where the carafe sits, is already wearing off after approximate 2 months of use. It shouldn't make any difference in the longevity of usage, and doesn't show until you remove the carafe. That is why it is rated 4 instead of 5.
The coffee tastes great and the attractive and compact design looks great on the counter.

..

6006840060008 it's fast & makes good coffee but not as hot as i like.

..

6006840060008 I never bought a coffee maker with a stainless steel carafe. If has a nice look in the kitchen and the size was perfect for my needs.

..

6006840060008 
The Cuisinart Compact Toaster is not just smaller than standard 2-slice toasters, it's better Streamlined and specially designed to sit sideways or facing forward on kitchen counters, the LED touchpad controls and a 9-setting LED backlit browning dial are within easy reach either way. That's a nice position to be in.


..

6006840060008 One side of the toast browns while the other side burns. The very thing that I was replacing when I purchased this toaster.

..

6006840060008 I have gotten perfect toast and toasted bagels a dozen times so far

..

6006840060008 5 stars for this toaster. I already had the 4 slice toaster but my son wanted a 2 slice for his apt.

..

6006840060008 Even though this is an inexpensive toaster, do not buy it. Spend a little extra money and get one that will work correctly. I have this and am very unhappy. It burns bread on the lowest setting. The only way around is to watch and end teh toasting cycle before it's complete to prevent the burning.

The easy-to-use, large capacity Custom 14 Food Processor speeds up all your cooking from quick weeknight meals to weekend celebrations.


..

6006840060008 I've only had this food processor for a few weeks, but it's pretty amazing.
Chopping: It's like lightning! Chops and purees even a small amount of food in its large bowl.
Slicing: Slices veggies and fruits very thin, very fast. If you're looking for picture-perfect slices you have to go one piece at a time, but if you just want some slices for say, pizza, this baby'll slice it up in no time.
Grating: Used it to grate some hard cheese for pizza -- no fuss, no muss.
Dough: The dough blade is great! I always dreaded trying to mix pizza dough and other doughs by hand but the dough blade makes smooth, well-blended doughs in no time.
Yes, it's a pricey machine but so far, I think it's worth it. It seems to be very sturdy and well-made and I plan on having this food processor for a long time.

Cuisinart CCJ-500DG Electric Juicer - 300 W Motor - Dark Green


..

6006840060008 Great to use, certainly better than squeezing by hand, a cinch to clean up

..

6006840060008 It's old technology that still works fine. Simple to use, push and voila...
the only thing is this product is limited to citrus fruits.

..

6006840060008 Its a good product for its price. Very handy. Its good for small families because you will have to clean it after 2 glasses of juice else it won't flow properly.

..

6006840060008 I like the product. mainly because I can juice my lemons and limes. without making a huge mess...

..

6006840060008 I was looking for a quality orange juicer and Besybuy employee showed me this product. I have been using 3-4 times a week and I really like it.

..

6006840060008 Great little machine. We use is primarily for making lemonade in the summer but it's been fine for Orange juice now

6006840060008 My recommendation is that do not juice every orange until it's bare to the skin do some until you get 70% of the juice from each half first and then do the remaining from all the halves. Fresh OJ is the best thing, I usually get the OJ and throw in some frozen mixed berries and mix them for an amazing concoction. There's so many varieties of oranges or there, I buy Sunkist kind, what kind do you buy ?

..

6006840060008 Have used it almost every morning. Easy simple to use and does a great job.

..

6006840060008 We have a small orange tree that produces LOTS of oranges. We make fresh orange juice most mornings to avoid discarding the excess oranges. Initially, I used a traditional manual juicer, but it was a pain constantly emptying the reservoir and I couldn't get all the juice/pulp out of the oranges. This little juicer makes it so much quicker and easier. It is super easy to clean up and doesn't take much space. I may only use it for a few months out of the year, but it is well worth it to me. I've only had it a couple months so I don't know how long it will last, but it seems to be well made.

..

6006840060008 Works really well for juicing. Just keep the extra pulp setting open or it will clog.

Create your favorite frozen yogurt, ice cream and sorbet with this automatic dessert-maker that simultaneously produces 1 quart each of 2 different flavors or up to 2 quarts of 1 flavor.


..

6006840060008 Easy to use. Directions are clear. The ice cream almost tastes like gelato. The sorbet is also excellent. Haven't made the frozen yogurt yet, but that is next! The recipes in the enclosed booket is great.

Cuisinart DLC-6 Food Processor - 8 Cup (Capacity) - Chrome


..

6006840060008 Cuisinart food processors are highly rated and this one has been great so far. The price was the lowest anywhere too.

..

6006840060008 Would recommend this to anyone looking for a good food processor. Great for quick salad setup. Clean up is a breeze!

..

6006840060008 Works well, cleans easily, and stores easily. What more can you expect.
Plus because of it we are eating more and different veggies. Which is good for our health.

..

6006840060008 This food processor is a nice size for most uses, and has sufficient power...it has several blades, making it very versatile when preparing foods...is easy to clean, and is attractive! I am very pleased with the quality for the price!!

..

6006840060008 I don't know why I haven't bought this sooner! Super easy to use, comes apart quickly, and very easy clean up.

..

6006840060008 Don't think about it, just buy it for those cooking projects you have always wanted to do. This will do the job and very well.

..

6006840060008 The suction cups are a great idea, we have granite counters and it holds well and very quick, we make Pico and salsa and its great.

..

6006840060008 This is my first food processor, and I did a lot of research before purchasing it. I've not used it much yet, but they few times that I have, it got the job done in a fraction of the time it would have taken to do by hand. So far very pleased.

..

6006840060008 The size and quality were great for the price. I returned it for the next model up for a little more money and a varied size feeding tube.

..

6006840060008 I paid really good price for this food processor. (Good quality and powerful)

Cuisinart's Metal Classic Toaster has a smooth brushed stainless housing with polished chrome and black accents. Its custom controls let you defrost and toast bagels and bread -- just the way you want them!


..

6006840060008 Purchased as a gift for our son and the toaster performs as advertised and as the reputation states.

..

6006840060008 Works great and easy to use. Replaces many past toaster ovens which are messy and heats bread, etc inconsistently. So far so good!

..

6006840060008 Toasts great and like the different settings. Very easy to use and clean.

..

6006840060008 This toaster is the mack daddy of all toasters....sure, you can spend more or less, but fully functional and easy to use...simple and elegant lines lead to an expectation of the best toasted bread, bagels, and pop tarts. I like the boring, dull finish which reminds me so much of the toasters of the 1960s....I would buy another toaster just like it, but probably wont get the chance to, as this one will last forever...gotta go, time to make some toast.

..

6006840060008 The functions are value added. Already utilizing the frozen and cancel features plus the toast controls are awesome! The design looks great in a small kitchen where countertop space small. Blends well with other Stainless Steel appliances. The only downside to stainless steel is that it requires wiping down with a stainless steel product or All Purpose Pledge

..

6006840060008 The more toaster reviews you read the more confusing it gets. Read reviews of a specific toaster on one website then on another and you think you are looking at two completely different products. So I decided to take a deep breath and order one I like the looks of. Well this happens to be a very decent toaster, browns the bread evenly and consistantly. Did not try toasting more than 3 batches of toasts on the same - light setting and all three batches came out pretty much the same color. Can't ask for much more from a toaster. The slots could be longer though.

..

6006840060008 Wanted just a toaster instead of small oven and this fits everything!

..

6006840060008 It works well. However, when you toast smaller items like english muffins they are more difficult to get out.

..

6006840060008 The product looks good and simple to use. The slots are wide
for bagels especially.

..

6006840060008 It looks great on my kitchen and is very functional. I've only had it for a couple of weeks so I can't really comment on its durability. I've actually had someone comment on how nice it looks (and toasters aren't usually attention-getting). Recommend highly!

..

6006840060008 
Our Metal Classic 4-Slice Toaster delivers innovative looks and spectacular performance. Two control panels each toast two items at a time, to any shade you want. That means you can toast thick sliced breads at the same time you're doing bagels! Feature two 6-setting browning Dials and dual Bagel, Reheat and Defrost Controls with LED indicators.


..

6006840060008 Not even my 81 year old mother, who will probably burn the house down one day, can burn toast in this toaster! It evenly toasts. I can have lightly browned toast and she can have dark toast... no need to toast twice, try to guess and make it pop up, etc . We hand slice bread so it can handle thick slices of bread, bagels and that sort of thing with no problem. Before, she would toast something twice and on the third try, attempt to guess when it was right and suddenly there would be smoke and it was a disaster. This one does it right the first time.

..

6006840060008 This is my second Cuisinart toaster. I loved the first one so much that I am replacing it with another Cuisinart toaster. The only difference is the new one is a 4 slice toaster and the old one is a 2 slice toaster.

..

6006840060008 I recommend this product for the price and versatile

..

6006840060008 Very pleased with this toaster and would recommend its purchase

..

6006840060008 My old toaster broke and all my kids wanted for Christmas was a new toaster. Even after opening all their toys they were still looking for the toaster. I surprised them with on a couple weeks after Christmas and they love it!

..

6006840060008 We can enjoy different level of crusts on the same time while it is still crispy.

..

6006840060008 I haven't opened it yet, but it's pretty and will look nice only counter.

..

6006840060008 Looks very nice and it works great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

..

6006840060008 Looking for a simple 4 slice toaster and saw this model at BestBuy. Light weight, 4 slice and easy to use. That is all I wanted in a toaster.

..

6006840060008 great toaster . Easy to use, convenient four slice toasting. Toast comes out perfect evry time.

ProCenter 1000 Center Channel Speaker-the heart of a spectacular Home Theater system The ProCenter 1000 is Definitive's "Better" center speaker in the acclaimed Pro Series. A ProCenter 1000 along with four ProMonitor 800s or ProMonitor 1000s and a matching ProSub makes a complete ProCinema system. All the components of the system are packed and sold separately allowing you to mix and match Pro Series components to build the system that best suits your needs. Don't let the ProCenter 1000's small size and affordable price fool you-it is a remarkably sophisticated product with huge sound. The 1000 incorporates many of the same technologies as Definitive's top-of-the-line models including BDSS drivers, pure aluminum dome tweeters, and planar pressure coupled mid/bass radiators for home theater sound quality that will astound you.


..

6006840060008 Sound quality was my first priority, but having beautiful white speakers to match my decor was a very close second! I had to hunt around for specs and went onto the manufacturer's website to see that they are so efficient that they will handle a 4 ohm impedance. Because of the driver sizes used, they actually have a tonal resonance that matches the pro monitors 800 better than the 1000 satellite speakers, so save yourself some money. The 1000 satellites match up with the 2000 center speaker better!

Easily heat water for your tea, coffee or other beverage with this DeLonghi KBO1401BK 1.7L electric kettle that features a flat, stainless-steel concealed element for optimal performance. The washable antiscale filter helps keep water pure.


..

6006840060008 I've been looking all over for an electric kettle that stands out and finally came across this DeLonghi. Absolutely love the shape and it's worked great so far. Boils a couple minutes faster than an older generic kettle that's since became garbage. It's a little pricey but you get what you pay for (in terms of look so far, hope it goes for durability as well).

..

6006840060008 
Enjoy rich coffee with this DeLonghi DCF6214T coffeemaker that features an aroma button, which enhances your coffee's flavor and scent. The pause 'n serve function lets you pour a cup of coffee before the pot is finished brewing when you're in a rush.


..

6006840060008 All would be great if the coffee pot did not spill each and every time anytime something is poured from it. It does not matter if it is water when filling or coffee when serving. Everyone who uses it has to clean up a puddle when through pouring. It is definately a fault in the design of the pot.

The progressive electronic browning control on this DeLonghi CTO2003R 2-slice toaster makes it easy to select the shade of toast you want. Reheat, defrost, one-side bagel and cancel functions allow simple customization.


..

6006840060008 I admit it, we bought this toaster because it looks cool. And in that area, this toaster is a winner. But after you get over how pretty it is, you start to feel like you might have paid a lot for the form and missed out on the function. The lever that is supposed to lift the toast up so you can retrieve it without burning your hands... does almost nothing. The slots for the toast are smallish, and if you use the bagel button you're going to end up with one very burnt bagel (just use a low regular setting to avoid this). Also, and this is still mystifying to me, the product image shows a round, black knob on top that I assumed must be for lifting the toast out without burning your hands. But the toaster arrived at my door with no such knob either on it or in the box waiting to be assembled (I checked 3 times). This was a disappointment. Overall, I would call this toaster adequate, but if you buy it, remember you are paying for the looks.

This espresso and cappuccino maker features a durable stainless-steel boiler and self-priming operation to make your favorite beverage quick and easy. The 48-oz. water tank is removable for easy filling.


..

6006840060008 We got this to replace our Espressione Cafe Retro after 6 years of spotty service. I loved the way the old one looked but it was a bit temperamental. Still, when it worked properly, it made good espresso.
The DeLonghi doesn't look as good or feel as solid as our old machine  also you can't put as many grounds in it so it's a bit weaker  but it's working as it's supposed to so far.
Decent value for the money if you like this style of machine.

..

6006840060008 Overall, I am very pleased with my DeLonghi - Icona Pump-Driven Espresso Maker. I enjoy cappuccino every morning.

..

6006840060008 I would definitely recommend this machine if you are looking for a beginner machine, makes some really good shots and good foamy milk

This DeLonghi kMix DCM04BL coffeemaker features a 10-cup capacity so you can make multiple servings at once. The one-touch control offers simple use.


..

6006840060008 The DeLonghi kMix 10-cup coffee maker is an easy-to-use, easy-to-clean coffee maker with a contemporary style. I really like the sliding lid for the water repository. It uses #4 filters and brews quickly.
The carafe could be designed better. The spout is designed such that you cannot pour out all the coffee (or pour out all the water when you wash it), and it was several days before I realized the lid could be detached from the carafe. (It happened to come off when I was washing it.) The included instructions are minimalistic. After several months of use the light on the front started to blink. There was nothing in the manual to indicate what this meant, but I found reviews online that said the light blinks when the coffee maker needs to be descaled.
Despite the less than desirable design of the carafe, I would recommend this coffee maker.

..

6006840060008 I bought this for my parents. They love the speed at which it brews their coffee but aren't too crazy about the lip on the coffee pot. They said it doesn't pour nicely into the cup and makes a bit of a mess. Too bad....I would have never paid this much for a coffee maker for myself. For the price you'd think it should be relatively flaw-free.

..

6006840060008 Previous DeLonghi espresso maker from Target within few months stopped dripping. This one is beginning to drip very slowly.

..

6006840060008 Espresso was excellent. The steamer, despite previous reviews, made a great silky foam.
Unfortunate that the gasket broke so quickly. I'm still waiting for the part a month later.
I can't give it a rating as I only used it once.

..

6006840060008 this product is too good. I would have accepted something a lot worse. I expected coffee. I got coffee. but good coffee. very. very. very good coffee! it didn't have to be this good. but it is. I'm a little scared of its potential actually and that one day it may rise up and take control creating some form of coffee themed dictatorship with delicious steamed milk.
but yeah. its really good.

..

6006840060008 Great little machine. It looks good on the counter but really suprises you with how good of a job it does at making your favorite coffee house drinks. It is very easy to clean. Steams milk very fast and makes good foam. Make sure you have a good burr grinder for your coffee, took me a few tries to get it how I like it.

..

6006840060008 I have always been intimidated by the idea of making my own espresso and lattes but decided to give this machine a shot after reading reviews on it over the web.

6006840060008 Previous DeLonghi espresso maker from Target within few months stopped dripping. This one is beginning to drip very slowly.

..

6006840060008 Espresso was excellent. The steamer, despite previous reviews, made a great silky foam.
Unfortunate that the gasket broke so quickly. I'm still waiting for the part a month later.
I can't give it a rating as I only used it once.

..

6006840060008 this product is too good. I would have accepted something a lot worse. I expected coffee. I got coffee. but good coffee. very. very. very good coffee! it didn't have to be this good. but it is. I'm a little scared of its potential actually and that one day it may rise up and take control creating some form of coffee themed dictatorship with delicious steamed milk.
but yeah. its really good.

..

6006840060008 Great little machine. It looks good on the counter but really suprises you with how good of a job it does at making your favorite coffee house drinks. It is very easy to clean. Steams milk very fast and makes good foam. Make sure you have a good burr grinder for your coffee, took me a few tries to get it how I like it.

..

6006840060008 I have always been intimidated by the idea of making my own espresso and lattes but decided to give this machine a shot after reading reviews on it over the web.
It is super easy to use, clean, and maintain. Takes me about 10-15 minutes tops to make 2 lattes each morning.

..

6006840060008 This machine ROCKS! very powerful.
worked great, fast and easy to use...

..

6006840060008 Really easy to use. The only down side is that doesn't swivel.

..

6006840060008 I dont know how i went so long without this!! I love how clean it makes my floors feel and so quick!

..

6006840060008 I love this steam cleaner! It works so well on my hardwood floors. I love how easy it is to set up and use. The cord is long enough and the water "tank" is enough IMO. Excellent product!

..

6006840060008 Love it love it love it... That is all I have to say :)

..

6006840060008 My daughter bought one when she was training her puppy to clean the tile from accidents, that was two years ago. She loved it and still has it.
We bought a family lake home last year and I decided to get one for cleaning the tile and wood floors so people wouldnt have to do it on their hands and knees. Everyone loves it. It gets used at least one a week on about 1000 square feet of flooring and we have had no problems with it at all. Two of our family members have bought them after using mine and love them.
I am going to buy another one for our home to clean my entry rugs and wood floors.
I wouldn't hesitate to buy this product.

..

6006840060008 First of all, the day I was expecting my steam mop, the delivery guy just dumped the product on my doorstep. What was strange is that I was in my living room where my front door is located. Didn't hear a knock or anything...just shuffling of feet and the sound of the delivery truck leaving. This was not bestbuy.com's fault so I'm not going to point them out on this..
BUT when I saw the package, the product was shipped in its original box. The company should know by now that people in shipping services are not the most careful people in the world. The box itself was flimsy and it appeared that it went through a lot. Anyhow, nothing was cracked nor were there scratches, but I feel that it could have been packaged to prevent potential damage.
SO when I filled when I assembled the steam mop (as per instructions) the unit still did not work. The light didn't even go on..nothing. I waited a few minutes thinking that it just needs time (item is supposed to start releasing steam in 30 seconds). As I mentioned before, It didn't look damaged by the shipping, yet I have no idea why it didn't turn on. To my dissappointment, it didn't work so I went directly to the store and traded it in with the Dirt Devil Gator since they didn't have this item in stock. Got a refund and costumer service was excellent. My overall review is that product look painfully flimsy and seemed like it could break after a few uses even if it did work. The base of the mop stick which connected to the steamer made weird noises which didn't sound too good (it wasn't cracked or anythng though). I personally would not recommend buying from this site, or even any other online site. I am also not confident in this product itself. Not sure if you guys still want to buy it, but hey..maybe it will work for you guys.

..

6006840060008 I purchased the dirt devil steam mop (black) with much excitment thinking I was going to have clean floors, however after using it just three times it quit working. Waisted my money on this product. It was hard to push, ran out of water to quickly, too small of water tank, two long of cord and the list of warnings went on forever. I believe this product should be jerked from the shelves so customers can spend their money on another brand that will work.

..

6006840060008 I purchased this with doing my carpet in mind. Have used it so far to mop the tile (Have alot of it) and it does a great job. Decided today that I would attempt the carpet and WOW. I was fortunate enough to get this for $30 and the value is unbeatable. yes I am spending a bit more time probably then I would with a more costly unit but now I know when I want to upgrade I will defiantly stick to steam mops that are reasonable. So far I have seem a lot of complaints that after 2-3 xs they didnt work I havent had that problem at all. This cleaned my carpet and believe me when I say it was dirty (had a sick 18 yr old cat) its cleaner than I imagined. I fully recommend this. Going to get one for my daughter who is just moving out on her own.

..

6006840060008 Got a "deal" on this steam vac for $30 on sale. Used the unit two times - on the third use, the unit would turn on, but would not produce steam. Best Buy warranty = 30-45 days. Must contact Dirt Devil, spent hours on phone with 'customer service'. Offered to replace if I mail in old unit cord and model sticker.
Would NOT purchase again - does not work that good on tile floor. I prefer my traditional mop. Difficult to fill water, feels flimsy, doesn't store easily, doesn't seem like mop heads will last very long.

..

6006840060008 I have a 10 ft. by 18 foot floor I wanted to keep clean. Used product twice and worked fairly well, a little hard to push. Used only bottled water as directed. On the 3rd use it would not steam at all! Followed all directions. Now have to cantact Dirt Devil for warranty and they are not help full. Should last more than 2 floor cleanings for 180 square foot floor. Product also feels cheaply made at pivot joint and in handle.

This Elite Classic EPM-250 popcorn popper features a stainless-steel kettle with a 2-1/2-oz. kernel capacity and a built-in stirring system for thoroughly popped kernels. The pull-out popcorn tray lets you easily access popcorn.


..

6006840060008 This popcorn popper was a Christmas gift for my husband. It is a good little popper---little meaning only pops 1/3 cup kernels at a time, for bigger appetites it does take a couple of batches. Difficult to let the popper cool down and than warm up for the next batch. Beats the flavor of microwave popcorn.

..

6006840060008 We love this little machine and use it a lot. The kids love watching it pop. It fits nicely on top of the cabnet, and looks good when not in use.We are very pleased with our purchase.

..

6006840060008 it is fun t o look at it, but the time and effort spent for such a meager amount of popcorn will relegate it to the garage

..

6006840060008 We love it! Super easy to use and clean.....fun for the kids to use. Highly recommend!

..

6006840060008 I tried to return this coffee maker. Even with a filter there was a lot of coffee grounds in any cup. The manual says to use "coarse ground coffee." Most commercial coffee is a fine grind. I did not want to buy a coffee grinder. Best Buy would not let me return the machine.

6006840060008 This is an Android 7" 4.0 OS, 4GB memory tablet + 5GB Cloud Storage for files, videos, music, etc.
If you are in the market for a good android tablet I would recommend the Ematic Eglide 7" Pro III multi touch screen tablet. The easy to use functions are displayed well and are ready to use with a slight touch of your finger..or if you have a capacitive stylus that works too.
I had my Android Ematic Eglide for more than 2 weeks and luckily had no problems.

..

6006840060008 I bought an ematic tablet that failed right out of the box. Sent it for repair ($14 expense) and it took 6 weeks, only to be not working (same problem) right out of the box again. I don't think they actually did anything to it! I'm in the process of trying to retrieve my investment; wish me luck!

Enjoy crispy food with this Emeril FR7015001 fryer that features 1000W of power and an immersion heating element for efficient operation. The automatic filtration and drainage system utilizes built-in storage container for simple cleanup and reusability.


..

6006840060008 This is a great deep fryer for the money. I like how the oil is filtered then stored in its own container. The gauge for the oil life is a nice addition as well. Every thing is dishwasher safe with the exception of the element

..

6006840060008 This fryer is awesome. I filter the oil and clean the fryer after every use. The oil lasts so much longer and food tastes better. Added benefit is that I am not eating everything out of my fryer for a week or two anymore just to get the most out of the oil before it goes bad. Everything is easy - I just put everything in the dishwasher for easy cleanup except for the heating element, which I wash by hand.

Emerson GQ100 Karaoke System


..

6006840060008 This machine is a total piece of junk. Most of the times it won't read the disks, when it does it skips around, displays only part of the lyrics and doesn't follow them. Wouldn't even work with the disk that came with it...which by the way, is a bunch of really really lame songs like Happy Birthday and Auld Lang Syne with background singing by someone's junior high choir.

This flatbed scanner can restore faded color photos with a single touch. Create enlargements up to 17" x 22" directly from film at up to 6400 dpi resolution.


..

6006840060008 Works well as advertised. Generally produced usable results.

..

6006840060008 Bought to help scan in family photos. It is a long-term project, just a few each day. The Epson scanner does a great job recognizing the photos, 35mm slides,and negatives.

..

6006840060008 It does exactly as advertised. It is a wonderful scanner. Would recommend to anyone.

..

6006840060008 it is a good scanner for printed material, good color, easy setup
I bought this scanner to scan photos, 35 mm negatives and documents. It works great for photos and docs but is useless for negatives.
when you scan negatives, at any resolution, scans are unfocused and images are blur
Dont buy if you want scan negatives
Frames for films are fragile and dont provide good support for negative .Frames has control marks, then, you cant use a strong support like glass or acrylic.

..

6006840060008 So far so very good with this scanner. I've scanned dozens of photos and hundreds of slides so far. It scans 4 slides at once and set to 3200 dpi it only takes about 3 minutes to do it. Comes with Photoshop elements which is more software than I'll ever need. Overall I'm very happy with this scanner. I would have given 5 stars but it came with lint or dust on the inside of the glass from the factory.

..

6006840060008 Sof far so good. I've only used it to scan a check to deposit to my bank. Hope the slide scanning function works but haven't tried it yet. Set up was quick and easy. I'm delighted so far.

..

6006840060008 Probably not as cheap as some all in one printer / scanners, but the quality, spped and features more than compensate.

..

6006840060008 It is a nice scanner, does a good job on documents and I've scanned about 100 35mm B&W and color negatives with great results. The included Adobe Photoshop I really really like. Only one small complaint; the film holder is a bit flimsy.

..

6006840060008 My 5 year old Visioneer 9020 died so I first bought a Canon 8800F but returned it because I could not get a clear scan no matter what I did. Bought this and have been nothing but happy with it so far. Everything I have scanned has been very clean and clear with good color matching. I should have known to make this my first pick since I have an 8 year old Epson 1160 printer and a 3 year old Epson all in one; both have been flawless with great results and I have never even had to clean the heads on the 1160 model. I highly recommend this scanner for all but the extreme cases. Great job Epson.

..

6006840060008 My old scanner would not work with Windows Vista so I bough this one and its great. Scanes fast and lines up your photo for you. I tried tilting the picture out of square and it comes in scaned square every time. I can haRDLY WAIT TO START RESTORING SOME PICTURES.

..

6006840060008 I'm very happy with my new Epson scanner. What I intend on doing is getting an external 35mm film adapter to work with it. I'd recommend this item to anyone............!!!!!!!!!!!

..

6006840060008 It's excellent to be able to either push a button or control it from the desktop. The software used is easy to understand--i.e. user friendly. Scans quickly and good quality.

..

6006840060008 I was a little skeptical when I saw this Epson scanner for a fraction of the price that other scanners were going for. I use the scanner for personal items, like scanning documents and pictures. I am very impressed with the quality of the scans and the ease of use. I definitely did not sacrifice quality for an economical price!

..

6006840060008 This product scans fine but only in pdf and photo format. If that is all you want, it is fine. I have not returned the product since I need a scanner and I have separate fax and laser print machines.

..

6006840060008 Easy to set up and use. Gives good quality for the price. Have had it for a month now and no problems using it so far.

..

6006840060008 I bought my daughter this same scanner to use in her dorm room. I was so impressed by the quality of the scans, I purchased one for my office too. Easy to use, quiet and does not take up a lot of space.

..

6006840060008 The scanner performs all the functions as advertised. It is ieasy to install and use.

..

6006840060008 I do agree with other remarks I've read on this scanner that the cord placement is extremely odd. But for the price and the quality of the scans, I'm willing to overlook it. Plus it's fast to scan, love that.

..

6006840060008 Totally outrageous scan quality for the price. It takes a while to figure out how to use it. It is not as simple as my older scanner, even though the resolution is much greater.

6006840060008 
For personal use in the home/home officeShreds 7 sheets per pass into 5/32 x 1-7/8" cross-cut particles (Security Level P-3)Features wide 9" paper entryMesh bin shows when basket is full


..

6006840060008 works good for home use- bills, important docs, etc

..

6006840060008 This shredder works much better than the higher priced ones that I have purchased in the past..It has a metal basket to catch the stuff that is shredded which allows you to see when it is full and needs to be emptied....so far so good....

..

6006840060008 It gets the shredding job done. I'm happy with it so far.

..

6006840060008 Great home shredder - shreds quickly and the basket base lets you know when it needs to be emptied. Only negative is it will only shred things 9" wide. Shred chute could be wider.

..

6006840060008 I like how quickly it can be used and can handle 5-10 pages at a time.

..

6006840060008 It's easy to empty the basket. You don't have to do it every 2 seconds, either. I can go 2-3-4 days without having to empty it.
Putting it back together after emptying it, half the time I couldn't figure out which way the basket should go. Once I knew which side was the back, I put a sticky label on there saying "back," and now I have no trouble knowing how to reassemble it.
I like that the shreds aren't little tiny pieces. If anything falls onto the floor as I'm in the process of emptying the shredder, it's no big deal, easy to pick up the few shreds. Then I put a plastic bag over the basket, turn it all upside down, and the rest is simple.

..

6006840060008 I had been looking for a new shredder for use at home. You hear so much about identity theft these days. This shredder shreds into very small pieces. It is easy to use. I've not had to use it too much so far, but it will certainly get a good workout at tax time. The price was also very good. It will also shred credit cards, which will certainly come in handy.

That's how you turn everyday life into a social, achievable, awesome path to fitness.


..

6006840060008 You set it up once and it tracks automatically. Resets at midnight. Uploads to electronics automatically by just opening app. You do not have be techie for this device to work for you.

..

6006840060008 I don't leave the house without the Fitbit! It challenges me to beat my number of steps from the previous day!

..

6006840060008 I bought 2, for my wife and I. We compete daily on who has more steps and actually gets us to move more. Easy to use and gets the job done

..

6006840060008 Bought this so my wife and I can work on being more active. They have us competing on who has the most steps each day so in essence it works. Synced very easily with our HTC M8 and Samsung Galaxy Note 3.

..

6006840060008 I am excited to get to use it and track my progress. Phone app is handy as well.

..

6006840060008 This is great for the price it is a little sensitive when walking so as you are setting it up it is actually counting activity even though you are not doing anything; outside of that the tracking is awesome.
It seems to be pretty reliable so far and it is very easy to use...the one negative was in mine you really had to jam the battery in to get it to hold in place while you locked the door. On top of that once it was in you would think it was not because you really have to tap the screen hard to get it to turn on...That is a plus and a minus..good for if you drop it it can handle the impact bad just for being a pain haha.
other than that if you wanted a simple tracker for a lot less money than fuel bands, and all the other watches and trackers out there priced at $100+ more than this is the item for you....It is definitely worth it for the cost difference.

..

6006840060008 Bought these for my parents to use, as they are avid walkers. They LOVE these...hubby did the computer set-up for them, as the Fitbit website can be tricky. My parents are already competing against each other to see who walks the most.

..

6006840060008 I would give it a better rating if I still had it. The app was really great, not crazy about the battery. The grip as you clip it on your cloth is not secure. I would clip it on my bra and somehow I lost it :(

..

6006840060008 This is a great pedimator yet the screen can be hard to read. I gave this to my mom and she loves it.

..

6006840060008 I purchased the zip in March and I am addicted to IT!
It is very easy to use,synchs with any phone and holds me accountable to daily goals. It tracks steps,calories,miles, and "active minutes". The zip in small and easily clips to your pants or bra strap.
I recommend a FITBIT to anyone who loves to move or wants motivation to move more.

..

6006840060008 Very good camera. Very good price. Very good product. Have other
Fuji cameras.

..

6006840060008 I am happy with the size, performance, picture quality and the 20x zoom of such a small camera. I like the fact that it is adaptable to many situations. Many features included are found on more expensive SLR type cameras. A great buy.

..

6006840060008 I've had 2 Fuji cameras previously that were very good. I wanted a smaller and lighter on this time. The video button is in a position that you will turn it on as you are snapping a photo. While balancing the camera, your finger in on the flash, the wrist attachment would not thread so it was unusable. After having the photos printed (at a shop - not a home printer) I felt the quality wasn't any better than my previous cameras although more pixels and zoom. I returned the camera. The saleman stated Fuji camera quality had declined in the last few years and recommended a Cannon. Right now I'll stay with my S800.

Capture high-quality photos with this Fujifilm FinePix F800EXR 16.0-megapixel digital camera that features EXR Auto for snapping up-close subjects. The 1080p video mode lets you shoot high-definition movie clips.


..

6006840060008 I bought the earlier version of this camera (F70 EXR) about 4 yrs ago, it was a bit more than I wanted to spend, but the reviews on various camera sites were great. It's certainly not been a "pampered" camera as it is thrown in my purse without a camera case, but it is always ready to take a picture whenever, where ever you need. The most impressive thing, to me, is the optical zoom feature and the stability control -- you can zoom in (not all the way) then edit the picture on the screen by zooming in, adjusting the picture (right/left), then cutting it without losing any of the picture quality. I've taken pictures of cars in motion, then zoomed & cut -- WOW! The pictures are great! Not ALL the pictures are clear, but with extra memory, you can pick & choose which ones to keep & which ones to get rid of. Overall, the best small, compact, digital camera I've ever had.
It is pretty scratched up now (with living in my purse for all these years), but has held up very well. I always charge the battery when I know it'll be used; the battery seems to give about 3 or 4 hrs of continuous use, or 200 (+/-) pictures. I've used mostly the EXR setting and only used the video once, so I can't really comment on much of the other settings or video quality. There is a setting that will take two pictures at different settings so you can pick the best one which is a pretty neat feature.
Just happened to see the "newer" version and thought I'd share my experience with the "older" one...

..

6006840060008 Bought this camera on line and shipped to home, so I didn't get to try it before I bought it.Pictures never looked as good in replay as they did in the screen. Image stabilization was sub par thru the full zoom range. Trade it for a Canon Powershot SX260 HS and I am very happy with it.

..

6006840060008 The picture quality is good, but what is impressive is that this camera can shoot 320fps. I was able to film a swing of a baseball bag and could actually see a ripple in the arm of the batter gradually move across the body.

Capture high-quality images with this Fujifilm FinePix JX650 digital camera, which features a 16.0-megapixel CCD sensor that enables you to shoot crisp photos and high-definition videos. Face detection helps create stunning portraits of loved ones.Memory card sold separately.


..

6006840060008 I got this camera on sale, which made it even better. The picture quality is very good. The video quality is also surprisingly good. It has lots of features and modes, kind of like the more expensive cameras. I did have some issues with getting the flash to work: even on auto, it wouldn't always use the flash in low-light settings, leaving the pictures dark. Besides that, though, we have had a good experience with this camera. We took it on vacation with us and came home with some great photos.

..

6006840060008 This camera is a good value and the ease of use made it the perfect camera to buy my elderly mom for her birthday.

..

6006840060008 Very nice camera looking wise & using it is very easy. My kids all use it.

..

6006840060008 I would buy it again. I wish I came with a memory card. The pictures are very good for an everyday camera

..

6006840060008 Simple camera with minimal features. Not recommended for night photos. Good to use in Day light and easy to carry.

..

6006840060008 I rec this as a gift. It is an ok camera nothing special. Has good features but not enough zoom.

..

6006840060008 I really like the ease of use on this camera, but not formatting my sd card, cost me to forfeit some important shots on my vacation. Stay away from the HD, takes up too much space on your card.

..

6006840060008 I won this camera as a door prize at a staff banquet and the dang thing didn't power up when I took it out of the box. I thought "oh the battery is dead" so I let it charge all night long (about 12 hours) and still no power. It works when plugged in, but that's it. I thought it was the battery so I bought a new battery and it still will not power up at all. I don't have the original receipt (but I have a copy) because it was a door prize. Bah hum bug!

..

6006840060008 Good camera for teenager. Easy to use and inexpensive.

..

6006840060008 Overall great product, cheap and very user friendly.

Snap vibrant photos with this Fujifilm FinePix S2980 digital camera that features a 14.0-megapixel 1/2.3" CCD sensor and dual image stabilization for image clarity. SR (Scene Recognition) AUTO optimizes camera settings based on your surroundings.


..

6006840060008 We got this camera on sale during the holidays for around $100, so it was a great price. We love the camera, but wish it could snap a bit quicker because it's really hard to catch a 2 year old in a certain pose before they have moved onto 10 different things. The picture quality is very good, but the LCD screen appears grainy at times. We had our second child this week, so I was snapping pics like a crazy man and the batteries lasted a week even when leaving it on too long while downloading the pics to my PC.
Overall - a good camera for the price and we are happy with our purchase.

..

6006840060008 This camera was easy to use right out of the box. Batteries have a reasonably long life.

Capture detailed photos with this DSLR camera that features a 6-scene SR AUTO mode that automatically adjusts the camera's settings based on the surrounding conditions. CCD shift image stabilization makes it easy to shoot clear photos.


..

6006840060008 This camera is amazing, especially for the price. There are cameras that cost double and triple for the same exact features. There are modes that are point and shoot that take great pictures. It also has modes with custom setting for the more advanced photographers. Get professional looking pictures every time! I love photography, and I have small children, this camera gives me the opportunity to incorporate my hobby into my everyday busy life. Don't spend the $ on the pricier cameras, this one is top notch!
-excellent in all lighting
-great battery life

Capture stunning images with this 16.2-megapixel Fujifilm FinePix SL1000 BLACK digital camera that features optical image stabilization for sharp, steady shots and records video in up to 1920 x 1080i resolution for arresting picture quality.Memory card sold separately.


..

6006840060008 The camera is great. I wanted a high quality, super zoom and that is what I got. Due to the tendency to have shaking issues with any camera that has a significant zoom, I often use a burst mode. By taking several pictures at once, you are more likely to get a steady shot that is where you want it in the frame. The SL1000 has a shortcut button for burst mode (no more searching through the menu to find the feature). Best of all, Best Buy price-matched Amazon, plus I had some reward dollars from a previous purchase, making it even cheaper.

..

6006840060008 Very good camera for the price range. Bought it as a backup and carry all the time camera to my NIkon SLR.

..

6006840060008 My wife had been researching cameras for quite some time and hinted that this is what she wanted. I then checked my BB store and found that this model had to be ordered online, which I did. Camera arrived a few days later and she is learning about it every day. Very satisfied with it and I was very impressed with the time of purchase and delivery.

..

6006840060008 I was able to be in the 2nd to last row in auditorium for my daughters Christmas Play and get close up shots. Even though she couldn't stand still for a good shot, I was able to get several photos my iphone would not have been able to get. Still learning.

..

6006840060008 This is just the camera I was looking for. I needed something that was easy to use to get the perfect shots of the kids from everything to great portraits to sports motion shots. Didn't have a lot of money to spend on an expensive camera. I also didn't really want too many features that I wasn't going to learn how to use. The picture quality is excellent and this is great a camera for someone who wants a little more quality and zoom but doesn't want to spend too much money.

..

6006840060008 Good camera for this price! I would recommend to my fiends!

..

6006840060008 This camera takes very nice picture's. Its very easy to use. Has several functions to choose from. No need to buy extra lens. The dslr world is in trouble with a camera like this out there.

..

6006840060008 You really not need more lenses as a 50X Optical + 2X digital covers most possibilities of lens needs. I Love it. Also has hot show for the Flash, and a 3" TILTING TFT-LCD, Great . . .
IT IS A GREAT CAMERA.

..

6006840060008 It is a good all around camera and is compact so it fits in any pocket comfortably.

..

6006840060008 I was apprehensive about buying this camera, but since taking my first shots with it, I can't say enough good things about it. I was very impressed by the quality of the shots and the level of detail even in zoomed pictures. I take a lot of concert pictures, and provided the band is lit from the front, it works great. If your subject is lit from behind, it will struggle a bit to focus and the result isn't that great. If you have sufficient light, you will not be disappointed....well, at least I wasn't.

This digital camera features protection from water, shock, cold and dust, so you can take it on outdoor adventures. The rubber grip helps ensure you'll always have a firm hold on the camera. The 2.7" LCD is easy to see even in bright conditions.


..

6006840060008 When taking pictures at night the pics were blurry.
And the zoom feature is horrible.
Do not buy!!!

..

6006840060008 Great companion camera for those hairy situations when you don't want to risk damage to your hugely expensive digital SLRs. Has all the usual bells and whistles that make it easy to use, and the panoramic mode is especially fun.

..

6006840060008 I used it on a cruise it had clear underwater pictures in rough waters but it's difficult to turn on and it's slow. It's not bad for the price.

..

6006840060008 Bought the camera along w the extended warranty that Best Buy offers, 18 months later took the camera to Hawaii n it stopped working!

..

6006840060008 Bought the camera Jan 2012. Used it until the first time brought into a pool in September of 2012. Before I got in I very carefully check to make sure it was closed correctly. Worked for awhile and then filled up with water. Returned to factory on warranty. They sent a new one. I asked why it failed and they said it happens. First time I brought the new replacement camera into the water was July 2013. Again, I check the camera very carefully to make sure it was closed correctly. Was in the water handling the camera like an eggshell. Went two or three feet under the water and little bubble came out the top. Called Fuji, explained what happen. They said its past the one year warranty. Said I could pay to have it fixed.
Before the water ruined it, the camera was terrible. On auto, exposure is too low inside or outside. Takes five seconds for first picture, so candid shots impossible. Even when people are posing, they are wondering why haven't you taken the picture yet. If anyone is not standing very still they will be blurry. Camera struggles to find focus. 25% of the time or more the picture is out of focus.

..

6006840060008 Planning a trip to hawaii and wanted a do it all camera. Chose this over a go pro because the price is great and it has a viewing screen. I tested this camera three times underwater in a pool. With good lighting conditions, the pictures come out great. Otherwise, it's equivalent to a bad camera phone at night. I reached the bottom of a 12ft pool and it still recorded and took pictures with no problem. Above water level, it takes great shots and crisp video. The panorama function is inmpressive compared to the one found on my galaxy note 2 and old kodak point and shoot. The camera also has the ability to keep the flash on indefinitely so you can use it while recording a video. I am very impressed with this camera. Just make sure you keep the switches on the memory card and battery door in the locked position. It does have the tendency to open easily but you'll be fine as long as its properly locked.

..

6006840060008 Overall good camera for the $. I had a waterproof Olympus in the past and it didn't last too long. This one seems much sturdier takes good quality pics and video. It takes a while to turn on and shuts off by itself quickly. Battery has decent life. Used mine for 4 days before I had to charge it. Love the charger, no cords to get in the way.

..

6006840060008 I have 3 cameras. This is the camera I take when we are on the river, at the water park or the pool. I wouldn't have captured as many memories as I have without this waterproof camera. I use to have to stay dry on the sidelines to take photos, but now I jump right in the water with the action. I also like its size. It fits in my pocket, or I latch it to my belt loop. I like to think of this camera as my sports camera, but to be honest it isn't fast enough to take action shots. I'm going to upgrade to a Fujifilm XP60 simply for the burst shooting feature. Oh, I do love the battery also. I can recharge it on the wall outlet, and it last for several days of picture taking-over 600 pics and several videos easy. But I wish it had a longer zoom without adding bulk to the camera.

..

6006840060008 I am a professional scrapbooker...don't want to ever miss a GREAT MOMENT...but realistically can not always SAFELY carry a professional camera..this works out !!!

6006840060008 Perfect camera for the average user. Good "bang for the buck". The drop and water resistance capabilities allows for less worries.

..

6006840060008 I bought this camera because we are always outdoors and with now 2 kiddos it has to be water and shock proof. I have used it in the pool and at the beach and it has worked great. The only bad thing I can say about it is the battery compartment. You have to make sure you lock it right because sometimes it closes but if it doesn't click then its not properly closed. Overall I like the camera

..

6006840060008 Was a birthday present for my 10 year old granddaughter. First time out she took to Disneyland and got great pictures. Easy to use, great picture resolution. She took pictures while on ride and they were in focus. Color was accurate.

..

6006840060008 It's a waste of money.
I bought this camera for the waterproof feature. My family and I spend a lot of time in the river over the summer. The picture quality wasn't what I was hoping for and I shelved the camera over the winter. When I brought it back out, the battery charged properly, but the camera refuses to turn on. I was extremely careful and followed the directions to a T, so I know there is no water damage and I didn't bump it on anything. Right now I'm in a pickle because I paid cash for it, the best buy I bought it at failed to put the purchase on my account, and since it's been 10 months I don't have the original receipt. So far it's been a huge waste of time and money. I recommend finding a different brand of camera altogether.

..

6006840060008 first used this on a cruise, very impressed with the results using the auto setting - easy to switch to beach, underwater, night, etc
the underwater video was incredibly clear with true colors
very satisfied

..

6006840060008 I got two of these for the kids. They are easy to use and very strong.

..

6006840060008 Bought the camera for a recent vacation to capture moments from our cruise. It worked for about 15 photos then went black screen. Didn't get any photos of our vacation. Upon return, best buy stated return policy is only 14 days. So I'm stuck with a camera that doesn't work. It was sent off for repair but no info for over a week.

..

6006840060008 Was great I give it a 9 ..I like how small It is and it fits in any bag I put it in.water proof is good .

..

6006840060008 i have worked in very harsh environment's that most digital cameras could not withstand the abuse. this camera can.

..

6006840060008 We bought this for use on a trip to Hawaii. It performs as advertised but if you have big fingers it is a bit too small. Overall there are a lot of options, but many are buried under multiple menus. Overall works great as advertised.

Outdoor enthusiasts, we've mapped every hill and valley for your next great adventure. Now with more detail than ever, TOPO U.S. 100K covers the finer points of the outdoors, with topographic maps comparable to 1:100,000 scale USGS maps. TOPO U.S. 100K includes terrain contours, topo elevations, summits, parks, coastlines, rivers, lakes and geographical points.


..

6006840060008 This topo map is of little value in a hand-held unit because the resolution is too high. If you descend to the level of a geocache search, you are below the level of the topographic markings. Also, the shading and appearance of the map is useful only at very high elevations.

..

6006840060008 
This microSD card provides detailed maps of Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio with topographical and hydrographical detail that is ideal for hunting, hiking or camping trips. The search function allows you to locate points of interest.


..

6006840060008 Was told by Garmin rep. that I needed to purchase Topo 24k Great Lakes in order to navigate through the trails in the Huron National Forest in MI. Total waste of money, does not recognize 99% of the trails. Do not buy for ATV trail riding/navigation.

This environmentally friendly LCD monitor is both Energy-Star and EPEAT Gold certified. Along with an energy-saving Eco Mode, the monitor offers impressive image quality with a 16:9 aspect ratio, 5ms response time and 20,000,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio. The wall-mountable monitor features a Kensington security slot, user-friendly graphical OSD menu and direct-insert horizontal connectors.


..

6006840060008 I was on travel and my laptop display failed. I went to the Best Buy to buy a temporary fix (another monitor). This monitor was inexpensive and fit the bill. It doesn't have the resolution of the laptop but allowed me to use my laptop. When I returned home, I plugged it into the desktop computer as a second monitor and it is very handy.
For a low cost secondary monitor it is perfect and will work in a pinch as an external monitor for your laptop.

..

6006840060008 I'd keep shopping if I were you! The picture just doesn't look LED quality. Have seen better now that I have this one.

..

6006840060008 For the price this monitor is better than expected. Graphics work well, only downside is the lack of usb connections to connect peripherals.

..

6006840060008 If you want t a basic monitor that woks get this one.
If you are looking for a very good monitor then buy something else.

..

6006840060008 Kept going off at random times. Also, it can not be tilted for better viewing.

..

6006840060008 I purchased this unit to replace a monitor that had failed. The intended use is for e-mail, word processing and Internet browsing. I had to return the first AOC monitor I purchased due to a defective on-off switch. The second one works well for the intended purpose. The fact that the on-off switch was defective right out of the box makes me wonder about AOC's quality control.

..

6006840060008 I bought this as a stand in monitor for a mac and had to return it the quality was so poor, resolution is terrible, colours are washed out and no tilt, feels like it was made from the same plastic they use for crisp packets, returned it for a hp 22inch for only 40 more and the difference is incredible, for a few extra quid you will get something a lot lot better..

Tote your effects processors, recording equipment and sound modules with this Gator Cases rolling 3U rack bag that features nylon material for a durable design. A retractable handle and recessed wheels allow simple mobility.


..

6006840060008 I have used a lot of cases over the years but this is my first soft sided rack case. I'm extremely pleased with every aspect of the product. It allows me to provide power conditioning with a Furman for both my effects unit and my amp. All I need to grab for a gig is my amp and this rolling bag (which allows me room to pack a couple of stomp boxes and cords) and I got everything I need without overloading my car or breaking my back. Totally worth every penny.

..

6006840060008 
Play back video and photos directly on your camera with this detachable LCD screen that features an integrated speaker with volume control.


..

6006840060008 The LCD bacpac gives a great view of what the camera is seeing. It also makes menu adjustments much easier than using the small screen on the front of the camera.

..

6006840060008 Nice to have. The new HERO 3 comes with wi-fi. You will be able to use your smartphone to see what you are recording without having to buy this. However, you won't be able to use your smartphone underwater so this is nice to have in certain situations and environments. You can also playback pictures and videos while using this item.

..

6006840060008 We love our Go Pro and have been using it to make sailing videos and golf videos but now our video quality has really doubled since having the screen bac-pac addition because we can actually see what it is we are recording and we can be sure to get the shots we are going for.

..

6006840060008 I mostly use my GoPro to take pictures of my weekends with my family. Before I would just point and click and hope I had a cool shot. Now with the BacPac, I can see what I am shooting, I can reveiw my pics and videos right there on the spot. and makes it easier to toggle throught all of GoPro's settings. AWESOME!

..

6006840060008 Bought this for my friend since he has the GoPro cam but needed this piece to complete the set. No complaints.

..

6006840060008 Got the product to increase the function ability for the go pro. Love it. Makes recording videos alot easier. Although its great for viewing and stuff, it kills the battery life and makes it die faster. It also increases the weight and makes the go pro bulky but its still manageable. Overall i like it enough to keep it. I just wished it had easier access to the menu instead of clicking through a bunch of stuff to get to the view/playback screen.

..

6006840060008 I am using this with a gopro hero hd, I taped continuously for just over an hour with the screen in place and not one bit of trouble. It requires the most updated firmware from GoPro but that was a very short process including downloading the video manager program. The video manager program will tell you if you need an update but the directions are clear on how to do it.

..

6006840060008 Works well, video looks good. very handy. Kind of expensive. This is the only way to see what you're doing with the GoPro, on the go. The set-up gets bulky, and you need to use the expanded cases to fit. LCD uses lots of battery.

..

6006840060008 great accessory for the camera since you actually get to see what you are filming

..

6006840060008 OK, the major short-coming of the GoPro is not having a way to see how you are framing your shots. This does exactly that, and then you can remove it to get more battery life. As stated, no need for a better quality LCD since you can't focus the camera. It's good enough for what you need it for. Anything better would just cost more. It is nice and durable, attaches easily, and comes with an extended back for making it fit. Go GoPro!

..

6006840060008 
The 11.0MP digital still resolution and Protune video mode of this GoPro Hero3 camera make it easy to capture high-quality photos and videos. Built-in Wi-Fi allows you to control the camera from a compatible device or Wi-Fi remote (not included).


..

6006840060008 You can take HD videos like the Pro's underwater, in the snow, at dusty sports, in the rain or where ever you want because the camera is protected in a strong plastic housing. The camera is easy to remove and it charges with a USB cable.

..

6006840060008 My son wanted one for the past two years. We bought the GoPro Silver this Christmas which is the middle priced unit, but has all the functionality my son needs.

..

6006840060008 Bought it to take pictures of the grandkids....and it does a great job. The problem seems to be trying to keep it charged, connecting to a TV and editing the video.
I will have the camera fully charged and put away. I go to use it a day or two later and it might work....or it's dead....and needs recharged.
The original mini- HDMI to HDMI I was sold was not the correct one. Went to the store and spent an hour getting one to work there. Purchased it, got it home and tried it....didn't work. I'm used to hooking up my laptop to the TV and have no problem doing so. Not totally hopeless doing some things.
I downloaded an editing program recently but need to spend some time learning more about it.
I wish companies would spend the additional money to include a manual instead of having to find everything online.

..

6006840060008 Very easy to use and the price was right too. Recommend getting other mounts also.

..

6006840060008 THIS GOPRO IS GREAT FOR THE ON THE GO SHOTS THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO GET WITH ANOTHER TYPE OF CAMERA. IF YOU WANT ACTION AND ADVENTURE SHOTS THIS IS THE DEVICE FOR YOU.

..

6006840060008 Bought this for my husband. He does MB races and is always watching his buddies GoPro videos. Now we watch his videos. He loves it!!!

..

6006840060008 The go pro is a great camera. The early ones were the worst with sound quality. This one has greatly improved but is still not fully there. The functionality of the app for smart phones makes it so easy to use and make sure that you are getting the right shot.

..

6006840060008 If you are going to do extreme sports buy this camera. But for anything else it is not worth it. $200 + 70 (back panel [so you can see what you are actually doing]) + more for the mount + this + that, you know what I mean and let's not talk about the "one" button for everything. Don't get me wrong it is a good camera but expensive and not practical for normal user.

..

6006840060008 Great camera for athletic teens. Easy to use. I recommend it.

..

6006840060008 Got these for gifts and they loved them. takes great videos and are easy to use.Can't wait to see what they do with them next!

..

6006840060008 
Enhance your video and photo capture capabilities with this GoPro Hero3 CHDHE-302 camera that offers up to 5.0MP digital still resolution and features built-in Wi-Fi for controlling the camera from a compatible device or Wi-Fi remote (not included).


..

6006840060008 Great camera for someone that wants to capture their adventures. The small size is very convenient. And the waterproof case is an added bonus.

..

6006840060008 bought this for my daughter - she loves it - used it for water sports on Jamaican vacation.

..

6006840060008 I loved everything about the camera, including the wi-fi feature. The only downside is that if you forget to turn off the wi-fi it will drain your battery. The battery life is OK but I wish it would be a little better but will most likely call for a bigger case, so the size it is now is great.

..

6006840060008 I really like this camera. It is easy to use and very versatile with all the different accessories. I love the playback on a phone feature. The accessories are expensive and the lighting is a somewhat poor, otherwise a great camera.

..

6006840060008 Bought it as a gift for young teenager. Easy to use and durable.

..

6006840060008 all around it's a great camera but taking photos it's not very well but for video its great if it had a zoom probably be a better camera.

..

6006840060008 Great for adventure and everything outdoors. So many accessories and attachments for this little camera. So many Professional athletes even use and love this camera.

..

6006840060008 works great and battery life much better with battery bacpac

..

6006840060008 We had a great time with our gopro's. My clients love wearing then while participating in all of the events we had set up.

..

6006840060008 I use this camera for my pilot training to review my flights and lessons. It works absolutely fabulously! I highly recommend it!

..

6006840060008 
Protect your HERO3 or HERO3+ Edition camera on land and the water with this GoPro AHDRH-301 replacement housing that features a waterproof design up to 197' to allow you to capture sharp, dazzling images above and below the water.


..

6006840060008 this is the standard accessory, the price is reasonable

..

6006840060008 Case works great and is reasonably priced to allow ownership of a spare case.

Hamilton Beach Big Mouth 14 Cup Food Processor (70570) - 3 Speed - 500 W Motor


..

6006840060008 I apologize but all I can say is it serves it's purpose very well

..

6006840060008 Due to the short bowl shaft that covers the shaft for the blade, any slightly liquid material overflows out of the large capacity bowl all over the machine and counter. Also there are many seams the way the food processor is constructed and all the stuff gets stuck in the seams. I called Hamilton Beach directly and was told that the food processor was not meant to hold any liquid type ingredient. SO BEWARE if you plan on using it for other than solids.

..

6006840060008 I like the different speeds And the large size and the large opening

..

6006840060008 I really like this thing! A real workhorse and easy clean up. Makes cole slaw in a snap!

..

6006840060008 Great machine and very well worth the price. I wasn't sure how much I'd use one so didn't want to put out big bucks. This one does it all! I wanted the French fry blade but wasn't listed but indeed, it came packaged with one. The suction cups really have suction, it's a breeze to clean and looks pretty impressive on the kitchen counter!

Hamilton Beach Big Mouth 67650A Electric Juicer - Black


..

6006840060008 I was just looking for a basic juicer and this one fits the bill. It comes apart easily for cleaning, however the filter is somewhat difficult to clean. It has been great so far.

..

6006840060008 TRYING THIS AND WORKS FINE. OF COURSE YOU DONT WANT TO STUFF EVERYTHING THAT'S BIG AND DONT FORCE IT SO IT DOESNT BREAK!

..

6006840060008 I was looking for an inexpensive juicer since did I want to invest in a more expensive one. Pulls juice of out fruits and veggies easily and to the max. The pulp that remains is dryer than that of other juicers I've tried. Easy to set up and easy to clean. I have recommended to several friends.

..

6006840060008 Xcellent product for the price,only complaint is i don't fell like I get most of the juice out of certain things like fruit but for the value it's a great juicer!!!

..

6006840060008 I wanted to start off small for my first juicer and after reading all of its reviews, I decided to go with this one. Everything was great until it stopped working a few weeks after I purchased it. I'm guessing it was the motor that went. I didn't want to buy another one, I upgraded to the Breville juicer( the one in the Joe Cross documentary-fat, sick and nearly dead) and I haven't had any issues thus far.

..

6006840060008 We bought this 2 months ago, and still have a blast making new juices and coming up with new recipes! This thing rocks

..

6006840060008 I love my juicer, it works great and cleans up easy.

..

6006840060008 This juicer is very easy to use and assemble. I love it!

..

6006840060008 I have made many different types of juice! Great flavor!

..

6006840060008 Great product for the price. Very well satisfied except that it is bulkier than we thought.

Breakfast They say breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Unfortunately, mornings are hectic for most people, especially families with children. So how do you cope with hunger pangs at breakfast time? If you're like most people, you have to rush through the meal, gobble down whatever's handy in the kitchen, or grab a quick, on-the-go bite.That's where the Breakfast Sandwich Maker by Hamilton Beach comes to the rescue. It's all about making a fresh breakfast sandwich you can grab and go. Just choose your bread and layer on the fixings: egg, cheese, precooked meat, or the ingredients of your choice. In five minutes or less, your perfectly assembled breakfast sandwich is ready to eat. You can customize your breakfast sandwich with a practically endless variety of fresh ingredients. Now you know why everyone who loves breakfast sandwiches wants this product in their kitchen!


..

6006840060008 Cool machine...fun to use....one step process without making a mess in the kitchen....kids love it!

..

6006840060008 The maker works wonderfully in making english muffins with eggs, cheese and any meat (sausage patties work best). Has it for three months. But, this week it just stopped working. Nothing happened. Just stopped working. Will try to get warranty repair, but as this price, not sure if it's worth mailing it in.

..

6006840060008 Great for a quick hot breakfast on the go
Great space saver.
Easy to assemble . Quick cleanup.

..

6006840060008 I can't say anything negative because it really is a useful item

..

6006840060008 I would recommend this sandwich maker to everyone.
It came highly recommend to me.

..

6006840060008 Great and easy way to make breakfast sandwiches. I have no problems with it and will be purchasing more for gifts!

..

6006840060008 This is a great buy! it is a great sandwich maker that is very easy to use and you can make a great breakfast sandwich in a matter of 5 minutes. It is easy to clean as well. I simply love it!

..

6006840060008 This is the easiest small kitchen appliance to use PLUS it makes a great sandwich.

..

6006840060008 This is a cool way to make an egg mc muffin & know the ingredients are what you want & not some processed junk. You do need to wait a few minutes between sandwiches because the heat for the egg drops. Will have to leave the top up for a couple minutes so the egg will cook & the bread won't burn.
My 7 year old grandson thought it was neat so this gets a thumbs up!

..

6006840060008 My husband loves this product. He makes breakfast sandwiches for all of us and they are delicious. He wishes that they would make a double sandwich maker.

..

6006840060008 
How does a coffeemaker work without a carafe? Quite well, thank you. Instead of pouring from a carafe, you just press your cup against the button to fill up. To keep coffee tasting fresh, the BrewStation coffee maker has an insulated tank and a gentle warming heater to keep coffee hot without scorching the flavor. Your last cup tastes as fresh as the first.


..

6006840060008 This product works wonderfully for me. I make coffee for a living and I really enjoy the coffee and iced coffee it produces! For the price I wasn't expecting anything grand but i was pleasantly surprised.

..

6006840060008 Was unable to return, no I would not purchase this coffee maker again, Not what I expected, I had the 4 cup and this is totally different.

..

6006840060008 Had another coffee maker that kept breaking parts off of it. I like that it does not have a carafe and dispenses one cup at a time with out The more expensive individual servings of coffee.

..

6006840060008 I bought this to replace a 10 year old electric percolator that finally died Was not sure of the after drinking perc coffee for so long Man I have to tell you why did I wait This unit uses less coffee and brews it stronger If you like it good and strong throw a extra scoop or two and set on bold Great machine for the money

..

6006840060008 
Modern look, same delicious coffee tasteNothing beats a cup of cafe-quality coffee at sunrise. No matter if you are brewing coffee for one as you head to work, or for your whole family on a weekend morning, we have a stylish Hamilton Beach Stainless Steel Coffee Maker with the ideal size, features and design for your coffee needs.Hamilton Beach offers you a wide variety of stainless steel coffee makers: single cup , 10-12 cup, the BrewStation line with unique one-hand dispensing, and even a full line of stainless coffee percolators for the old-school coffee lovers out there. If you are seeking an attractive, stainless steel coffee maker with great features and delicious, fresh-brewed coffee taste, Hamilton Beach is the right choice for you.


..

6006840060008 This is our third Hamilton Beach Coffee Maker. We love the no carafe design. The old one was working fine, but slow, and we had let it get pretty gunked up, so decided that at the $40 price we could make the purchase of a new one. We especially like the container that you fill with water and then just "plug" in to the unit. That was my only complaint on the old model - too many spills and a narrow slot to pour water in. The new coffee maker has solved this problem and still has the other features we loved on the old one.

..

6006840060008 I am very satisfied with this coffee maker, it is easy to operate and makes good coffee. It is pleasant to the eyes . I am dissapointed that I cannot clean the internal parts, filter basket and coffee chamber in the Dishwasher, but it is still a good unit for my purposes.

..

6006840060008 The settings are easy to do. The lift off and fill tank are great and easy to put on and off. I like the flat bottom filters. Easy to fill. The dispenser makes it fast and easy to get that first cup in the morning. No mess!

..

6006840060008 Easy to fill the water container; easy to fill your cup with no glass carafe to break; keeps coffee hot (you can program it to stay warm up to 4 hours).
We love it soooo much we bought a second one to have as a backup just in case something happens to it. Usually when I find a product I love and I have to replace it, it' slither been modified or discontinued. Didn't want to risk that with this great coffee pot!

..

6006840060008 Will not last long. Cheap plastic. Took 10 loads to get the plastic taste out.
Side fill is very good feature.
I would pay a lot more for a complete unit made out of stainless steel!
Design is very good!

..

6006840060008 Great coffeemaker. Easy to use and looks good on the counter. Sleek design.

..

6006840060008 This is a great coffee pot for the price. No worries of a carafe, just fill your cup and go.

..

6006840060008 THIS IS A GREAT COFFEE POT- I BOUGHT THE EARLIER VERSION AND USED IT TIL I BROKE THE HINGE OFF THE LID- I WAS REALLY GLAD TO SEE THERE WAS A NEWER VERSION THAT IS MORE DURABLE AND EVEN EASIER TO USE THAN THE OLD VERSION. NO MORE POTS TO LIFT OUT AND POUR- JUST PLACE YOUR CUP OR LARGE TUMBLER AND AS EASY AS 1-2-3 COFFEE IS IN IT WITHOUT ANY MESS!!

..

6006840060008 No pot to clean or burn. Makes good coffee. Like the removable water tank. Coffee could be a little hotter, but overall happy.

..

6006840060008 Easy to use. I really like the water reservoir, not too many things to take apart early in the morning. Makes good coffee for price. I mainly bought it for the dispenser, great for grabbing a cup out the door.

Hamilton Beach 44755 Coffee Maker - 12 Cup - Stainless Steel


..

6006840060008 I am disappointed that the clock won't keep time no matter how often we correct it. We can't set it to make coffee before we wake because of this. I will be returning it.

This Hamilton Beach Power Deluxe 64699 stand mixer delivers 275W peak power to help ensure your recipe's ingredients are thoroughly mixed. The 6 speeds can work through many batters and doughs, and the mixer unlocks from the stand for handheld use.


..

6006840060008 beaters don't reach bottom of the mixing bowl and the bowl does not turn automatically when mixing. Beaters are hard to remove for cleaning

..

6006840060008 It's a basic simple mixer easy to use, attach or dettatch from its stand. The glass bowl is great ! The base dish will rotate and there's the manual button that can move the dish and bowl from center to closer to the edges to mix the stuff better. Light mixer if you want to go handmix.
It's not an all grown up mixer, but I bake quite often and those do the job fine.

..

6006840060008 to date I really like my kettle. I read reviews on amazon but bought from best buy. I would recommend reading the programming instructions. If I could change anything it would be the way you set the clock and timer. It takes a bit to do and if you need to unplug which is recommend when not being used you have to start all over, would be nice if they could add a batter spot that would hold the time, timer and temp setting. Other wise I love this kettle. heats up fast, ( a full pot about 5 min) I will note that if you are a light sleeper and your bedrooms are close to the kitchen you will hear the kettle turn on, its not very quiet, but we have gotten use to it. I also like to programmable temp for tea, hot coco ... and the heating element is not exposed. over all I am happy with the kettle .

..

6006840060008 I really, really liked this kettle it made warming water for tea so easy for me. I could walk away and if I got busy it didn't matter because I didn't boil away all the water and burn the pot. This was so great for me that I bought two of them, one for my vacation home.
However! This kettle only lasted 2 months at my vacation home and then it quit. I hope the other one lasts longer when I return. Maybe this was just a defective one but I see one other review saying the same. Such a good appliance but....

..

6006840060008 I love the preset temps that I can set with a few pushes of a button, allowing me to brew different varieties of loose-leaf tea at the optimum temperature! Super quick heating time too!

..

6006840060008 The kettle is easy to setup and use. It heats up and keeps the water fairly hot for an hour. It doesn't keep it at boiling but after an hour it is still close enough that a short boil (less than a minute) brings it back to boiling. I liked it so well that I bought it for a Christmas present for my sister.

..

6006840060008 I bought this on 8/26 and today is 10/11. The kettle gave up on me a little over a month. Wasn't happy at all. I at least was able to get another type of kettle.

..

6006840060008 Design is good, pours easily, no spilling.
The different temperature settings are nice since I drink a lot of green tea.
I like that it doesn't shut off immediately once boiling temperature is reached but keeps boiling about 30 seconds longer. Those who don't like that can turn if off before it shuts off automatically.
I cannot rate durability yet for I just got it a couple of weeks ago.
Advise before first use: boil and discard the water about twice as often as recommended in instructions, after that the funny smell will be gone.

..

6006840060008 I love this kettle! I had been researching variable temp kettles for some time, and they all were over $100 and had enough bad reviews to make me skeptical. I came across this one and for the price and free shipping it can't be beat! I especially love that I can program it to turn on at specified times so my hot water can be waiting for me in the morning (I don't like to wait for coffee....). My only complaint is that, after being unplugged, I need to reprogram the time and auto on time. Really not a big deal. I love love love this kettle! Don't yet know about the durability because I've only had it a few weeks

..

6006840060008 i've had it for about a month and have no complains so far
it's great to be able to use both C and F scales as well as setting custom temperatures
there are other brands that do the same, maybe even cheaper but everyone seems to have a complaint about all of them, usually due to cheap materials and poor manufacturing
i took a chance with this and so far I'm pleased

Hamilton Beach Programmable Thermal 10 Cup Coffee Maker (49855) - Yes - 10 Cup(s) - Metallic - Plastic


..

6006840060008 This coffeemaker didn't even last a month! Went to make coffee and it won't even turn on. Completely dead!

..

6006840060008 Coffee does not get hot, pot leaks easily when pouring, have to really shove the lid into place, which given how the lid is constructed, feels like it will eventually break or leak anyway

Hamilton Beach Smoothie Smart Blender (56222) - 700 W - 1.25 quart


..

6006840060008 This blender works awesome. I use it everyday with no issues. My only issue is the lid is hard to snap off.

..

6006840060008 
Hamilton Beach Stand Mixer (63327) - 3.50 quart - 6 Speed(s)


..

6006840060008 This is a very good product for people learning how to bake for the first time, and it's also at a very reasonable price .

..

6006840060008 Overall I think this is a good value. If you're not planning on using it all that often and don't want to invest the kind money for an upper end mixer then this is a good choice.

..

6006840060008 I'm not a heavy baker, so I don't need a mixer that often. But on occasions that I do, I wanted one that does the job. This is an awesome mixer for the price. The flat beater gets great coverage around the bowl while mixing. I found that you have to tilt the head up to add additional ingredients, but that's no big deal. Overall, nice mixer.

..

6006840060008 I got this mixer for Mothers Day and I love it! It is great for cakes and baking. It comes with three attachments, very easy to use.

..

6006840060008 Great product and price. I use it to bake cakes every week.

..

6006840060008 I was hesitant about buying this item after reviews on other websites. I'm so glad I made this choice. Great stand mixer without the expensive price tag, excellent for baking just like the kitchen aid. I loved it.

..

6006840060008 this is a great mixer, works just like a kitchen aid! stands up to thick bread doughs, cookies, anything i throw at it! LOVE IT!!

..

6006840060008 I used it once to make a cake. I am not a heavy user. I was tired of using a handheld when I wanted to bake. I like the style of the mixer and most importantly, it gets the job done. No complaints.

Designed to accommodate up to a 7-lb. chicken or a 5-lb. roast, this Hamilton Beach Stay or Go 33472 7-quart slow cooker features a clip-tight sealed lid to help prevent spills while you're on the go.


..

6006840060008 We were looking to upgrade from a 5 qt slow cooker to something larger with a "warm" setting. The hinged lid design got my attention, and after investigating reviews and checking one in a store, I was convinced. It's perfect for carrying and setting on a buffet line - everyone else is looking for a place to set their lid! We have already used it every week since we got it.

..

6006840060008 I was excited to use this for my growing family and for bringing food to other locations. I used it once, everything was great. The next time I plugged it in, nothing happened. Tried different outlets, etc. Nothing worked.
The worst part is that my husband threw away the box so I'm stuck with a useless piece of equipment.

..

6006840060008 Got this as a Christmas gift for my wife. The handle on the lid of her previous slow cooker was breaking. She wanted a larger cooker that also had a locking lid. She had not seen this model and style before and was pleasantly surprised. She was even happier when she used it the first time. The 7 quart capacity is just a little larger than our previous unit. This model also fit in the cloth case that we had from the previous unit, to keep it from collecting dust when not in use. Overall we are pleased and hope that the hinges and other parts hold up over time.

..

6006840060008 Bought this a month or so ago and have used it 5 times so far. The size is great for my family of 5. Everything I have cooked in it has been great. The best thing about it is the lid that keeps in the steam. It is also great for transporting. No worries of the lid popping off and your food going flying.

6006840060008 
Hamilton Beach Wave Crusher Blender (58143) - 700 W - 1.25 quart


..

6006840060008 Great blender. The lighter weight pitcher makes for easier handling. Pour spout is great. Easy second hatch for additions while blending. Lid engineered so that drips fall back into the pitcher. Quieter than my 20+ year, second hand model. The only drawback is that the lid fits so well it is hard to pry off.

..

6006840060008 Is a nice shape blender, price is very good, does the job as expected.

..

6006840060008 Wow the price was great for this blender. Works so much better than my old one. Quick as can be. Easy clean up too

..

6006840060008 so far so good....every blender ive had never chops ice, and never mixes ingredients well..

..

6006840060008 This blender and similar I have owned (having the spicket type spout) are very good for daily general use. It does not do ice quite as well a a more powerful one, but eventually grinds it up.

..

6006840060008 If you are looking for a blender under 50 bucks that does a good job at blending fruits and vegetabes, this is the one to get. It has a nice glass picher with great pour spot and comes in black.

..

6006840060008 It is a good blender for it's price. The glass contain makes it easy to clean.
The blade is sharp. Really a powerful tool.
But it is a little bit too noisy when use.
All in all, good for the price.

..

6006840060008 FOR THE PRICE OF THIS BLENDER, YOU CANNOT DO BETTER. AMAZON SELLS IT FOR LESS BUT BB MET THE LOWER PRICE. FREE SHIPPING TO STORE NEAR YOU. BRAND NEW ITEM- LOOKED BRAND NEW.
GREAT REVIEWS ON AMAZON AND GREAT WARRANTY. TOO CHEAP FOR YOU- GO SPEND $300 AND BE DISAPPOINTED.

..

6006840060008 We tried this for Smoothies and other stuff and it just not run at all

..

6006840060008 I love this blender. Its awesome for making smoothies. It has an awesome lid never seen it on other blenders. Cable storage. Strong glass. Good price!

..

Powerful and versatile yet easy to use. The Harman Kardon AVR 1700 has virtually everything that you want in an audio/video receiver. Do you want sheer power? The AVR 1700 has 100 watts per channel. Want a variety of entertainment sources? The receiver includes vTuner Internet radio, DLNA 1.5 and AirPlay for wireless reception of your music and HDMI inputs for DVDs, HDTV, Blu-ray Disc media and video games. How about a system that's easy to use? A mobile app, remote control and intuitive menu system offer sheer simplicity. With all of these features and famously superb Harman Kardon audio, the AVR 1700 offers spectacular entertainment.


..

6006840060008 For my needs this was to be a nice product. It had a nice sound to my ears, and handled all of my AV needs.
I fought with it a long time to be able to use the AirPlay feature as it was difficult to setup, and required several reboots of the receiver to get working. This was the primary reason I purchased this over other offerings.
Other than that it worked well for 1 year. Then it would only go to a flashing amber light when powered on. Trying to work with their support has been a nightmare. I doubt I will ever resolve this or reach any type of satisfactory solution.
Unless something amazing happens in the future I doubt I will be purchasing their products again.

Listen to your Bluetooth-equipped device's audio through a compatible home entertainment system with this Harman Kardon BTA 10 Bluetooth adapter that memorizes up to 8 different devices, so you can quickly access your music.


..

6006840060008 I bought one BTA10 unit (GG0038-0036424), were able to pair it with an Iphone 4 but could not do it with a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. What do you recommend?
Is the BTA10 able to connect to the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3?
Thanks.

..

6006840060008 Documentation says it works up to 33 feet but if I move more than 3 feet away from it, it begins to cut out. Disappointed.

Get ready to sink some battleships with this Hasbro 38194 Deluxe Battleship: movie edition game, which includes 5 Navy ships and 5 alien ships for hours of play as commander of the alien fleet or the human fleet.


..

6006840060008 Though we did not actually purchase the game from Best Buy i still thought it would be helpful to review. The game is as fun, and easy as the classic, except for set-up. Little kids under about 12 have problems, because you have to enter each of your ships into the computer rather than just playing. Sure you don't have to use those features, but they could have made the game simply sense the ships at that premium cost. Has many game modes, and features. I have been playing one player against the computer, and it is actually pretty fun.

..

6006840060008 I thought it was overpriced. It was easy to put together. It was hard to get the game started and also very repiticious. i guess it had to follow the movie but very drawen out and tedious. I would not recommend it, if you want to play battle ship buy the original cuz this electronic version is not worth it.

Breathe in fresh air with the help of this Heaven Fresh HF 210UV portable ionic air purifier, which features electrostatically charged dust-collection plates to trap pollutants. Germicidal UV light helps create a healthy environment.


..

6006840060008 I've had a few air purifiers in my life and they all have a couple settings for low and high. This does as well, but it doesn't move air out of of the machine, the fans inside don't blow hard enough even on high to blow out a cigarette lighter. I've only had for less than a month but still on the fence.

Easily integrate your 11" Apple MacBook Air and peripheral devices with this Henge Docks HD01VB11MBA docking station that features a vertical design to help save space. USB and Mini DisplayPort interfaces allow wide-ranging connectivity.


..

6006840060008 The concept and the look of the Henge Dock is wonderful. Clean lines, takes up small space on desktop and then computer is also taking up small space on desktop.
But Henge Dock did not work; had only two (2) USB ports; and no on/off switch (to turn computer on/off at end of day you would have to take it out of Henge Dock and then again take it out of Henge Dock to turn it on).
I returned it to store.

Compose custom mixes with this Hercules DJ Console RMX 2 4780729 2-deck DJ controller, which features 2 jog wheels, 8 velocity pads and high-resolution faders for simple operation. The 24-bit/96kHz high-resolution audio ensures production of lush sound.


..

6006840060008 Really a great product, all functions and set up were straight forward. Would recommend it for a novice or semi-pro DJ.

..

6006840060008 First off I want to say I love this product. I have been a DJ for 18 years now and have used many products. I have owned the original RMX for studio mixing so I wouldn't have to connect my turntables and I was not pleased at all with the original RMX. I was going to purchase a pioneer DDJ-SX but didn't want to lose the functionality of my turntables I love so much. I ended up connecting my turntables to the RMX2 with Virtual DJ 7 Pro and it is amazing. I can use my turntables in timecode mode, switch to play regular vinyls and use it as a controller all at once. I used to have a M-Audio Trigger finger mapped to trigger all my cue points, effects, etc.. but the RMX 2 takes care of that all. The cross fader is a little short but It can be adjusted in the settings. I also have an external mixer that will override the cross fader on the RMX2. I use Virtual DJ 7 Pro and feel with video and the ability to map any device on the fly makes it superior to all other programs out there. Not to mention they were one of the first DJ programs to come out on the market. I used to use their software dating back to Atomix MP3 using webcams to control my mp3s, and back when you could only purchase the timecoded vinyls from France! I also used Serato before and it was a great software as well with awesome sound quality but I still prefer VDJ. You get a %50 discount off of Virtual DJ Pro with the purchase of the RMX 2.

Cruise to your favorite tunes with these Hifonics Atlas ATL693 3-way speakers that feature 6" x 9" injection-molded polypropylene woofer cones, 1-5/8" Mylar midranges and 3/4" silk-dome tweeters for a vibrant soundscape.


..

6006840060008 I purchased these to replace some blown factory speakers in my Saab. I have them running on a 4 channel Brutus amp along with 4 inch Atlas front speakers. These are defiantly a improvement over the factory speakers before the factory's blew out. They are clear and produce decent mid bass. I would say if your looking for something to replace some worn out factory speakers these are a great choice. But if your looking for something to really pump up your system you should look more into some Polks/Alpines/Rockford Fosgates.

..

6006840060008

Manage your weight and monitor your health with this body composition scanner that goes beyond a traditional scale with KnowledgeBook technology that measures body fat, body water, muscle and bone mass.


..

6006840060008 This product worked fine at first, but then as I continued to use it I noticed that if I weighed myself multiple times it was different every time, sometimes as much as 4 lbs different. And all the additional features as far as muscle mass, BMI, water weight, etc, doesnt tell you anthing valuable, they are just averages based on your height/weight/age. I will be returning this unfortunately.

..

6006840060008 simple to use, simple to understand. big numbers, easy to read.

..

6006840060008 I purchased the SC-565C. One of the reasons I purchased it was because the website states that it has a Lifetime warranty. When I received the product the manual stated that it only has a 10 year limited warranty. Best Buys website also states that it has 3 modes. Not true. It only has 2 modes Normal and Athlete mode. I looks like should spend more time keeping their website up to date.

..

6006840060008 I train and compete so I need to know how much water weight I have. "Athletic mode" gives me an accurate read out so I know whether to eat healthy or hit the sauna.
To get consistent read outs weigh yourself at the same time (I find the morning to be the best).
Only if you press "Power" does it take the detailed information and store it. Otherwise just step on like any normal scale for the weight.

..

6006840060008 I bought this scale about a month ago, it still works great! Very simple to use. No complaints so far. This scale comes in 2 varieties: one using AAA batteries and the other using lithium ion batteries. I strongly recommend the lithium ion batteries.

Show off your favorite digital photos on this HP DF1010P1 photo frame that features a 10" widescreen LCD and 1024 x 600 resolution for a clear, detailed display. The USB 2.0 port enables easy connection to a computer for simple file transfer.


..

6006840060008 Returned frame has really bad view angles. pictures looked great at on 1 angle.

..

6006840060008 This is a very easy to use picture frame display remote control is nice too and it looks great

..

6006840060008 Picture quality is great and the ease of use is amazing. Accepted a usb and copied files easily

..

6006840060008 Frame damaged, so I had to get a replacement. Could not get replacement to work with my MacBook Pro computer; replacement would not work per instructions in user manual, e.g., "Menu" button inoperable on frame and remote control. I had to make two trips back to Best Buy store and buy an SHDC reader just to get my photos on to digital picture frame. People I dealt with in customer service and geek squad were superior, but I only managed to get a marginal capability (less than I had on my previous digital picture frame 8 years ago). Very good service but a very poor product!

..

6006840060008 Overall it's a great concept for personal
Use in our technological world

..

6006840060008 I have always wanted a digital photo frame but I held out to get a 10 inch display and it was well worth the wait. The color and clear display of the pictures are awesome. I like the fact that I can transfer pictures from my computer on to this device and it holds a lot of pictures as well. Great product.

..

6006840060008 A great digital picture frame. Easy to use and stores photos so you can change them or set a slide show. The features, such as the clock,etc, are nice but make the menu navigation and personalization a bit confusing. Uploading photos is easy though. For the price, it is an excellent frame that gives great quality and ease of use to those who want to change pictures often.

..

6006840060008 We bought this for my sister in law and loaded it with family pictures. She and her husband are totally non tech and had no problem operating the unit. Nice picture, great size easy to set up and use

..

6006840060008 My husband bought this for me as a gift, and then had to spend hours and hours learning how to set it up so that he could present it to me with pictures in it. After, we both worked a couple of hours to figure out the best ways to use it and get pictures on it from the computer. I still don't remember how to do even the simplest thing on it when I wanted to load more pictures. Completely counter intuitive. Just to load pictures takes many multiples of pressing buttons. Horrible!

..

6006840060008 One ofseveral pictureframes. Simple anddies thejob. Nice frame

The Industry Choice in Financial Calculators. The HP 12c Financial Calculator celebrates its 30th anniversary as a trusted tool for business and financial professionals. This robust business calculator delivers powerful processing in a collector's edition package.


..

6006840060008 Great little calculator. Built solid and I expect it to last for many years.

..

6006840060008 Battery life is excellent, numerals are clear, light weight, flat form factor!
Perfect!

..

6006840060008 Good caluculator for work and personal use. Once you learn how to use the HP 12 c it's difficult to go back to using an ordinary calculator. However I question it's durability. I seem to be replacing this calculator every 2 to 3 years which is becoming very costly. I question it's duarability as the same thing keeps happening.....'it just stop working" even after replacing the battery, it doesn't work. If I didn't think the functions were so great, I would not keep replacing.

Safeguard your photos, videos, music and other important files on this HP v300a solid state drive that features an ample 240GB capacity to store your documents. The Serial ATA interface helps ensure an easy connection to your computer.


..

6006840060008 Out of box failure. HP wouldn't replace ssd because it does not have a serial number. Sent unit back for refund could not get a replacement as hp stoped making them. Look to a different brand.

..

6006840060008 First off, let me say, this SSD is fast. It sped up everything and replaced my old 20GB SSD that only held my OS. Now I can at least put a few games on this 240GB SSD and get the benefit for my games too.
However, the installation was unbearable. It was NOT plug and play. I tried to clone my 20GB with the included Acronis software. Not only did it not see the SSD, but neither did windows.
I eventually had to use windows administrative tools to go in and manually format the drive. Then I had to download a 3rd party cloning freeware tool to get it to clone. Ugh.
In the end it worked. I'm happy, but I can see the novice user throwing a fit and returning it. Try to get it to work! For the cost of this drive and the size of the drive, it's worth the headache. Not to mention you get a free 2.5 HDD enclosure with it! I used Macrium Reflect (freeware) to clone.

..

6006840060008 Would recommend for breathing life into any machine!

..

6006840060008 Great update for any Mac it was a great solution for new hard drive that I actually Wore out

..

6006840060008 Awsome for my college student. Great for web brousing and uploading and downloading data. Super fast processor and good space capacity. Recomended to allmy friends.

..

6006840060008 I bought for a HDD replacement for laptop, used the SSD in my laptop, and used the HDD with the SSD External Kit for spare drive. Also works on HP Laptops with the HP Protect Smart and HP Cool Sense Features

..

6006840060008 I got two of these to use for the drives in my RAID for my office PC update, an HP i7 desktop. I also installed an Intel SSD from Best Buy as the operating system and program drive. The whole setup is very fast and the fans never kick on in the desktop. Very quiet! I had an SSD on hand and the enclosure and USB3 cable that came with the HP drives allowed me to use the extra SSD as a transfer drive. I backed up my old RAID from the old machine onto the extra SSD, it took about an two and a half hours. I then restored the backed up files from the extra SSD to the new machine with the RAID set up with two of the HP SSDs and the restore process took ten minutes. Nice time savings! The included enclosures and cables and mounting brackets made the job a breeze.

..

6006840060008 I had too much trouble trying to get it to work correctly with my MacBook Pro so I returned it for an intel 180 gb ssd.

..

6006840060008 This item works! I installed Windows 8 on an HP 8710w with a 120GB HD. Purchased this from my local BB and followed installation procedures. In just a few minutes, the system was cloned to the SSD! I swapped the drives and WOW what a difference! No noise, fast, less heat! No problems at all! If everyone would install the max memory in their system and one of these, their old computer would perform like a new one!

..

6006840060008 So for the past two weeks i was on the look for new SSD , and after countless searchs i came to a conclusion that SAMSUNG 840 is the way to go. as i was at best buy about to buy one i checked their inventory and this ssd was there, i was extremely surprised by the specs and i decided to buy this just because of the specs and that PNY made this .
3 days now and its a solid product , i have new dell with i5 with turbo boost 2.5(3.1ghz) sata II and i got on benchmark result on this ssd 434 read and 128 write speeds!!! fast !
and with 3 years warranty this product is a solid choice .

AT&T; EL52200 DECT Cordless Phone - Cordless - 1 x Phone Line - 2 x Handset - Speakerphone - Answering Machine - Caller ID


..

6006840060008 I am very pleased with this AT&T phone. I needed something my wife could operate. The answering machine is "one touch:.

..

6006840060008 Love the phone great price just second base does not charge phone no biggie. Got cell phone just needed land line

..

6006840060008 We purchased this phone for several reasons, 1-price, 2-design, 3-easy set up. So far it as received A's from us across the board. It is not a fancy phone but it does have the basics in a way that was easy to set up and very easy to use. So far I have had nothing to complain about. Loving it right now!

..

6006840060008 I think maybe this phone sat on a shelf too long before I got it. The batteries in both sets do not last as long as any phone I have ever owned, (at least 5 or 6). So the great deal I got on the phone will eventually be negated when I have to buy new batteries. Other than that, I am happy with the quality all around.

..

6006840060008 I needed a new phone at a good price, and name brand

..

6006840060008 For the price and style, it can't be beat. Enjoy all the features without
any hassle or confusion

..

6006840060008 Not what I expected from ATT. It had most of the features I needed and I planned on having this for a while. Within a year all the phone batteries needed replacement. The volume faded and I ended up yelling at my callers. Calls were dropped multiple times on same call. Very disappointing.

..

6006840060008 Neat, durable phone; however, you can hardly hear the sound with the volume turned all the way up. Probably buy Panasonic or V-Tech again next time.

..

6006840060008 Phone works well, but the sound quality is not as good as I had hoped for.- words are clipped and conversation sounds like in an echo chamber. My brother said that I sounded as though I were on a cell phone. It does have nice features - answering machine, intercom, speakerphone, and caller ID, to name a few..

..

6006840060008 These phones sound great. They set up quickly and features are great.

This compact stereo system features a color-changing cabinet that adjusts to your needs with the touch of a button for just the right atmosphere and a passive subwoofer for impressive audio.


..

6006840060008 We use this device in our kitchen to stream talk radio during the day, and often take it outside on the screened in porch to listen to music in the evening from our iPhones. I love the portability and for it's size it has good sound.

..

6006840060008 This is a very cool product for my teenager. But the second day she used it, it STOPPED WORKING! I have to drive a bit to go to a Best Buy & have yet to bring it in for an exchange. I hope this particular one is a fluke.

..

6006840060008 Bought this for my daughter and she loved it! The speakers are loud and clear and she usually has the lights turned on as a night light. :)

..

6006840060008 i absolutely love this product. it emit great sound quality, and to top it all, the led colors are very cool.

..

6006840060008 This product is a great buy. The sound is good for casual listening. It is portable and small enough to go anywhere. The light changing features make it fun at times, but it can be turned off when needed. Very easy to use!!! I may need to get another one for the kids because they borrow this one all the time.

..

6006840060008 I was pleasantly surprised how good the sound quality is on this. It's very easy to use, and I like that it also charges my iPod. The changing colors are really cool, but it's also great that I can turn them off if necessary. My young nephews love watching the colors in the dark. Great product!

..

6006840060008 Got this 4 my sister for Christmas & her & her kids love it. Any time I walk in their home it's always on. The kids love the way the colors "pulse" to the beat of the music. Can't wait to get one for myself!

..

6006840060008 I bought this ipod player/docking station for my 11 year old daughter, and she really loves it! I wanted something more unique looking than the boring black or silver rectangles out there. It was super easy to use, sounds great, and she really enjoys all the different colors! Overall - great product.

..

6006840060008 I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it. The changing color was a hit. The sound is great and she uses it everyday.

..

6006840060008 I bought one for each of my kids. We were extremely surprised at the sound quaility and they found it "cool" that it had a mode to light up to the beat of the song. It also makes a great nighlight.
Great product. I am pleased.

..

6006840060008 
The iP11 is a great looking way to listen to great sound. Wake or sleep to your favorite iPhone or iPod tunes through high fidelity neodymium driver in a specially designed Reson8 speaker chamber with EXB expanded bass circuitry. Time sync button instantly sets clock to iPhone or iPod time. Line-in jack to play any audio source.


..

6006840060008 Overall a good product, but like so many docking stations It lack in volume.

..

6006840060008 I purchased this because Best Buy advertised this product as having a remote control. I returned the first one and Customer service sent me a second one. The second one also did not have a remote control. The customer service was awful. They did not try to rectify the mistake in Bestbuy.com .
I felt that I was really dealing with "Beast" Buy.

..

6006840060008 Nothing special but if you are looking for something to charge your Apple product with good speaker quality, this is a good deal. I use this to listen to Pandora in the morning and the sound quality is pretty good.

..

6006840060008 I use this unit in my garage mostly when cooking out. I live on a busy street and the street noise is no problem with the unit. I had trouble syncing the time with my iphone but it was very easy to manualy set the time. It was exactly what I was looking for.

..

6006840060008 I had bought this IHOME thinking it would be a great purchase and last a long time... I turned out obviously to be wrong. Within about 2 months the IHOME was broken and unusable. I was frustrated and upset because there went a good $60 bucks out the window. Take my advice and be careful if you buy this product, it doesn't last the time it should.

..

6006840060008 shortly after purchase, the clock function ceased to keep correct time and the change clock time function also stopped working altogether.
emailed product contact resource for instruction on how to correct these problems
they did not provide any assistance
instead they said to return it to the seller
shortly thereafter the up and down volume functions ceased to operate
this thing is a piece of junk not worth your money or your time

..

6006840060008 This will allow you to wake up to your Ipod. Here are a couple of issues I found.
1) You can not listen to your Ipod on Shuffle for sleep mode or any mode. So your songs will always play in alphabetical order.
2)Even on the lowest setting the display is too bright. (I have to turn off the lighted display)
3) This may seem stupid, but the buttons when pressed "click". During normal time its not that big a deal, but at 3AM having to hear that click over and over cause I am turning the display on and then lower or hitting snooze is annoying.
4) No Radio
But It sounds pretty good and looks really good!. OH 1more thing DOES NOT come with adaptor plate for Ipod Nano generation 4 or below. Only generation 5. Does not tell you that. Had to order adaptor from Ihome for $5.99 for my Ipod generation 4.
Honestly, its expensive and for the price either shop around for something cheaper or fess up an extra 20 spot and get a better IHome model. Kinda wish I took mine back when I had the chance.
:-(

..

6006840060008 I bought this for my teenage son for x-mas. He recently told me, "Thanks, I really like this". It was music to my ears.

..

6006840060008 Would really like this if the LED light went one more step dimmer

..

6006840060008 Love this ihome alarm clock. perfect size for my nightstand. easy to use. sound is really loud so if you want it for parties or something u might want to buy a bigger one. sound is really good just doesn't get wicked loud. awesome item!

Enjoy quality sound on the go with these Infinity Reference X Series REF-9603IX 6" x 9" 3-way speakers that feature edge-driven soft-dome tweeters to minimize distortion and Plus One woofer cones for loud, clear audio.


..

6006840060008 Nice speakers. When I first put them in my Tundra I really did not notice a huge difference but once I broke them in for about 1-2 weeks, they really came to life. Very clear mid low to highs and very efficient, crisp sounding speakers without an amp. I'm building this system one step at a time and in the long run, considering going with powered sub or upgrade original HU (or both) to round out the low end. Feel very good that these speaker will sound even better as I upgrade other components

..

Monitor indoor or outdoor locations with this INSTEON 75791 wireless IP security camera that captures images with 640 x 480 resolution and features 60 IR LEDs for clear visuals at up to 98'. The built-in wireless networking offers remote access.


..

6006840060008 I bought this so it over look my van. When I point the camera at it, All I can see was the hood of my van. lol well that won't work for me because I wanted it to see my whole back parking lot. No matter how I try, you can't adjust the view or anything.
The motion detector wasn't too bad. The recording was abit annoying. I had to call tech support for help. You have to turn off a lot of features on your IE or Firefox to get this thing working. When it recorfds, the folder always pop up. So if your typing or doing anything, it'll pop up and you'll have to closed it. You can't even min it cuz it'll pop up again.
Anyway, I won't recommend this to anyone, I return this and got the Logitech 750E its like Day and night!! cost more but well worth the money!

..

6006840060008 Easy to setup and has a decent picture in daylight. Decent night vision range also.
Power suppy cord died after 3 months. Called Best Buy for a replacement and they can't get one. Did not want to climb up and.have to unmount camera from top of business to send back to Best Buy. Found a replacement power cord on Amazon for $14.

..

6006840060008 Camera has a very narrow and far away focus point, great if you want to watch a road 100 feet from your house, worthless in your driveway though. Software is terrible and the setup is still ongoing 2 days later. It created multiple IP addresses and keeps getting confused on which one to use. This also created problems when it would TRY to record, most of the time it would fault out and not record anything. Save yourself the trouble and buy some other camera; not worth the time and frustration this thing has caused!!!

This iON America Air Pro Wi-Fi 1011 camcorder features a waterproof design that lets you capture still images and videos while underwater up to 30' deep. The USB interface makes it easy to transfer files to and from a computer.


..

6006840060008 This is a nice camera with an excellent picture. However it may take awhile compared to other cameras to set up. The instructions are not clear. There are no apps available yet for wi fi use and smart phones. ( after an hour of looking for it I found out they are waiting for approval ) The wi fi podz did not lock properly the first time and I was weary of getting it wet since ther is no warranty for water damage I took it back. If you have patience this is a nice camera with alot of accessories included.
Pros: looks, nice picture, comes with accessories, easy on/ off
Cons : no apps availble yet. not many additional accessories available like replacement lense or mounting options.

IRIScan Book 2 is a portable scanner that allows you to scan books and magazines anytime, anywhere and without ripping pages off. Simply roll your way across the document, and your scan will be saved automatically on the included MicroSD card and ready to be shared. The device completes the I.R.I.S. mobile scanner family, and comes with the cutting-edge OCR software Readiris Pro 12 compatible with both PC and Mac.


..

6006840060008 I actually brought my travel laptop with me to the store, along with an 8GB micro SD card that I bought on Amazon for something like $6, fully prepared to test the scanner in the store before leaving because I wanted to ensure it worked.
I bought a refurbished one that looked good as new for $50. I was very impressed with how it worked. Other reviews say the scanner is "tricky" and "takes some getting used to". I have no idea what they are talking about . This unit is very easy and straightforward to use. This scanner is lightweight and smaller than I expected, another plus.
The scans aren't super crisp, but neither are many photocopiers I might use to photocopy a textbook or cookbook or magazine article. It does the job and for the refurbished price, a no brainer.

..

6006840060008 
This pen allows you to scan words, sentences or paragraphs into your computer from newspapers, magazines, faxes, letters and more. 2 customizable buttons allow you to assign keyboard commands, such as enter or space, for added convenience.


..

6006840060008 The user manual is inadequate to guide the non-geek new user. Basic information is missing, like the manual (buried at the end of the Demo program). Also, helpful things like how to successfully install the software; what to uninstall if the first install fails; and how to get to important screens. Customer support relies on email exchanges, rather than more practical chat exchanges. Answers arrived 1-2 days later. Moreover, the tech support agent did not carefully read the exchanges, so they offered inappropriate and/or incomplete responses. Certain name and jargon used in the manual and by tech support were conflicting. I wasted many hours trying to make it work. For what it is worth, a techie friend eventually did make it work, but I can't afford to keep him on-call at my house. If a device or program is easily learned, logical and helpful for me to use, I'll keep it. But if not, as in this case, I won't keep it.

..

6006840060008 I have only been using this for a couple of months. I am in school for nursing and I have to say. . . This product cuts my study time in half. I don't have to type anything. I can have my slides, book, and notes in front of me and scan all three in conjunction with one another to make one study sheet for tests. It scans almost as fast as I can type, without the whole typing part. Which is really nice. It also scan over yellow highlighter. Which is super convenient! I wish I had this for my other degrees.

..

6006840060008 This is a really useful tool. It is not perfect and has a slight learning curve. It does exactly what it says it does and it is really easy to install and use right away. I do have to go back and edit a little bit but it is still much faster than typing out a book verbatim for outlines and notes especially if the book is dry or technical.

..

6006840060008 I was hesitant at first to purchase this scanner because of the negative reviews I found here. I still went ahead and bought it anyhow. And then when I received it and got it working, it'd show nothing but garbled text. I thought, "oh, just like some rewiews said." I called BestBuy.com to return it but then telephone rep suggested perhaps it was defective. I hadn't thought of that. So I got a replacement. I wasn't expecting anything different for results but, boy, was I wrong. This thing works like a charm. I am so happy I didn't give up on it. Perhaps the delivery carrier was to blame for the defective one, but whatever. This hand-held scanner's worth the price.

..

6006840060008 - Does not scan text clearly
- Does not import text into PC or Mac legibly
Perhaps the other editions of this product function better?

..

6006840060008 I purchased this to take notes of important material for school reference. It does a pretty good job at reading the words, only an occasional glitch or two. The directions leave a bit to be desired, but overall it's a useful tool and I am satisfied with it.

..

6006840060008 
Easily translate words by scanning text using this pen that recognizes up to 128 languages and features 11 language pairs. The voice synthesis feature allows you to hear text you've scanned.


..

6006840060008 This scanner works, but it's technology glitches sometimes and it's best to restore it to factory settings when that happens. The scanning is also a little slow to ensure accuracy and bright lighting is definitely needed to go faster. As a college student, my typing speed is pretty fast and I feel that sometimes I can type faster than the pen can scan, but if you are a slower typer, this pen could be very beneficial to you.

Scooba 390 Floor Washing Robot: Make your floors shine at the push of a button with the Scooba floor washing robot. The four-stage cleaning process vacuums, washes, scrubs and squeegees your floors for a thorough clean. Just fill the tank with cleaning solution and let your robot do the dirty work.


..

6006840060008 This is the second Scooba that I have owned and both do what they are suppose to. Fill it up, start it up when you leave the house and come back to a squeaky clean floor. Only complaint is the price.

..

6006840060008 IRobot really needs to improve the scooba and Roomba cleaning pattern, with the same technology as the braava/mint and neato vacuums. Im sorry but I am not digging this scooba for the price at all, first feel when i took it out of the box was the quality isn't there in the craftsmanship like the roombas, cheep plastic. The performance isn't there for the price due to the fact it misses a bunch of spots, and on my tile floor, the tracks from the tires were awful. When I emptied the dirty water bin it was dirty, but there sure wasn't a lot of dirty water in there, as if it left a lot on the floor, the bin was not even half full of dirty water, for the price the bin should be at least half full of dirty water, it shouldn't miss spots in open areas, and should not leave tire streaks, its a no go for me, bought the mint instead and love it.

..

6006840060008 If you have tile, it will leave a small water trail on the surrounding ridges of the tile. Semi-Noisy
I would imagine if you have hard-wood flooring or laminate it would work great.

..

6006840060008 I was disappointed with Scooba because it does not get the water off of the floor. They will need to improve this feature. I already own the Roomba and love it so thought the Scooba would be as high in quality but it is not.

..

6006840060008 I don't normally leave bad reviews, but since I paid so much for this Scooba cleaning system, I expected it to work. I used it twice, and it worked ok (still got hung up at spots). I used it again today and it is leaving puddles of water everywhere, and NOT picking up any of the water. Contacted I robot and they gave me a list of things to do to try to stop this issue. I could understand if I've used the thing for a year, but I have only used it twice. I'm going to try to return it.

..

6006840060008 The Scooba does a great job cleaning the floor. I was shocked to see how large this model is, but I was extremely pleased with how it performed. This particular model had upgrades to improve battery life and maintenance, which I believe has made it perform much better than the last model based on reviews I had read. It is rather loud , but I usually just turn it on and leave the room. Overall, I'd recommend the product if you don't feel like scrubbing your floors yourself.

The DreamTime Pro clock radio for iPhone and iPod gives you the option to wake to your iPhone, iPod, digital FM radio or the alarm. Every 5 seconds the volume will gradually increase until maximum volume has been reached.

Take your tunes on the go with this Jabra Solemate portable speaker that features Bluetooth technology, so you can stream music from a Bluetooth-enabled source up to 33' away. A built-in battery provides up to 8 hours of playback between charges.


..

6006840060008 Great sound quality especially for the size... take this everywhere with me since it's so easy to travel with. Worth the money.

..

6006840060008 Good sound for the size, but I think most of the newer products are these days. I also have a JBL Flip so have compared them side by side. The SM seems to have a little better bass tones but the Flip can play considerably louder (good tone, no distortion). When I'm at my desk I do prefer the SM because the slightly better sound quality at lower levels, but if I'm in a larger room or it I take it out in the garage to work on a project then I prefer the Flip because it simply plays louder (with good quality sound). Price aside, I think both products each have their strengths but are about equal overall. Given that the SM is 50% more, I can't justify recommending it over the Flip.

..

6006840060008 I was given a Jabra Solemate to review and wanted to share my experience as it really is an excellent portable speaker. The sound is great, I love how far away it can detect the source (answers calls as well as plays music) and it has some other great features. The AV cable is built into the bottom of the speaker so if you want to plug directly into your laptop the cable won't go missing. The "voice" in the speaker is fun, telling the user it is connected and when it powers on and off. Jabra Solemate comes with a bag so you can hear the sound perfectly but take to the beach without worrying about sand.
Great product!

..

6006840060008 I'm impressed by the BIG sound from this little speaker. The sound is clear and rich and continues to be so even at LOUD volumes. The rugged durability is a big plus, as is the splash resistance. Ours was even dropped in the shower (not by me!) and continued to to work perfectly!

..

6006840060008 I received a Jabra Solemate for review purposes. All opinions are 100% mine.
The Jabra Solemate Portable Speaker has made our summer even better. We've used it at the pool to listen to music on my iPhone. It only takes 30 seconds to connect via Bluetooth and the sound quality is amazing. The volume controls are great - we have no problem hearing the music from 10 feet or more away.
I like to use it in my home when cleaning as well. I like that it's wireless so I can carry the phone in my pocket while keeping the speaker in a central location. The durable bag eliminates worry that sand or water can get into the speaker if you carry it to the pool or beach.

..

6006840060008 It is awesome how such a small box can produce such quality sounds! Listening to music where I wanted in the past has always been a challenge. Most of the time you have to find a plug in for whatever device you are using. I know you can play music on some phones and laptop but, really those speakers just do not do it for me! I have been looking for a good speaker with bass! Yes, I am one of those who like to hear and feel the bass while I am listening to music! This speaker has it!
The Jabra Solemate comes with the speaker, USB cable, sound bag, audio cable, AC charger, and a quick start guide. I found it very easy to turn on an use! Really I did not have to even look at the guide. All you do is turn the Solemate on then hold the button up for three seconds for the Bluetooth connection to start. Then, it will begin to talk to you telling you it is ready to connect. As, soon as you are connected it will let you know that also. Very cool and funny at the same time. It is a dark sexy sounding voice to me.
It is so easy to take this with you anywhere! All you need is a bluetooth device with you {and everyone always has a cell phone} and instant connection. You can use the bag to protect it against dust, sand and dirt as well as moisture. Great for taking it to the beach or outside on a high humidity day!
I would highly recommend this speaker! Love it!

..

6006840060008 My husband has been the most excited for the Jabra Solemate. He says it is the best thing ever to bring into our workout room to play music while we are exercising on the bike or lifting weights. It is shaped like the bottom of a shoe on the bottom and very versatile. It is scratch resistant and it comes with a great splash proof drawstring bag that I have already used while the kids played in the sprinkler.
My favorite thing about the Jabra Solemate is that it talks to you. I wonder why more electronics don't? You turn on the bluetooth and it tells you how to connect and then when you connect it to your smartphone, MP3 player, tablet, laptop, or anything that can play music it says it is connected. You can connects via Bluetooth or the cord stored neatly in the bottom. I also like how it makes this low bass noise when you turn it off or on. According to its specs, it has a strong, deep bass from an integrated subwoofer and rich, vibrant acoustics from dual tweeters, the Solemate sounds great at any level. It goes up to 120 dB SPL* (at 0.5). I connected it to my phone and my kids thought it was great how I could turn it up and down through my phone controls or through the controls on top of the Solemate.

..

6006840060008 This little speaker is easy to transport and fits in my hand, all while delivering great sound. The battery lasts and the range is great. It is easy to set up the Bluetooth and with minimal buttons, even my four year old can operate this speaker! Great for outdoor parties or just lounging around the house! Worth the price!

..

6006840060008 Great sound for something so small. It's super affordable too , and I like the different selection of colors.

..

6006840060008 My favorite thing about the Jabra Solemate is the fact that it is cordless. I have a toddler who loves to pull on cords, and a cat who loves to chew on cords. The Jabra Solemate is left alone by my two mischief-makers! The sound quality is also amazing. I use it to replace my laptop speakers when watching movies. I feel like I'm in a a movie theater! :-)

Create delicious juices, smoothies and more with this juicer that features a 3600 rpm motor for powerful performance and an extra-large round feeder that accommodates most fruits and vegetables.


..

6006840060008 I ended up returning this item, do to the fact that I don't have time to bake or cook with the discarded pulp as suggested.
I liked the idea , but thought better to try a type of blender /juicer that will chop up and juice the entire fruit or veggie.

..

6006840060008 This juicer works great and is well worth the money. Tried lots of different combinations of fruits and vegetables. A piece of advise, go easy on the ginger root. Just a little bit gives you lots of flavor. Awesome product.

..

6006840060008 I bought this juicer because of all the great reviews. After 2 weeks of use, the motor stopped running. It would also overheat just from kale and the pulp was always very wet. Since it is covered under "warranty", I sent the juicer back with a money order for shipping. It has been over a month and have not received anything back and apparently my order has been cancelled (for reasons unknown to any supervisors) and they are sending me my broken juicer back. This is the worst company I have ever dealt with and I don't recommend buying any type of Jack Lalanne juicer. I bought a "Bella" juicer since then and it works great. I will never buy anything from Jack Lalanne again!

..

6006840060008 It is a great product, however the container could be larger to hold more of the juice

..

6006840060008 THIS JUICER IS SO EFFECTIVE I USE ONLY HALF OF THE PRODUCE I AM USED TO USING. IT GETS EVERY DROP OUT AND MORE! I REALLY RECCOMEND THIS, ESPECIALLY FOR THE PRICE. I GOT IT ON SALE, BUT EVEN NOT ON SALE THE PRICE IS GREAT.

..

6006840060008 excellent product for those who want to start a change from poor eating habit. Also it is a great motivational tool that will have us thinking a little more about our health, and allow simple access for making a good worthwhile snack supplement. Use it in good health.

..

6006840060008 Good product at a great price..thanks to Best Buy. I researched tons of juicers..and after reading tons of reviews..and checking several out first hand..I ended up with this quality unit.
My wife suggested I check Kohls and Walmart. Both had it available at a decent price, but I am a loyal BB customer..and I thought, why not check there? Anyway..to make a long story short. I am a happy customer. Mostly because..in the end..Best Buy had the better price. Even with $25 Kohls cash I still came out ahead by nearly $20 more dollars!

..

6006840060008 This juicer is really quiet and really easy to use. It is also very easy to take apart and clean. We've used it almost every day since we opened it for Christmas! My husband loves the opportunity to drink fresh and healthy juices! Our whole family gets involved in the juicing process, and my daughter loves to put the fruits in the machine!

..

6006840060008 After comparing other juicers we decided to go with the Jack Lalanne. This is the first time we have juiced and it has been a good experience so far. The juicer was easy to setup and to keep from having a big mess we put a bag in the container that holds the pulp and then add it to our compost. You get of juice and less pulp. I would recommend this juicer to anyone especially if your new to juicing. The book gives alot of great tips and recipes to try.

..

6006840060008 Great juicer for those who are hopping on to the juicing bandwagon. This juicer is powerful and works great.

..

6006840060008 
Create delicious juices, smoothies and more with this juicer that features a 3600 rpm motor for powerful performance and an extra-large round feeder that accommodates most fruits and vegetables.

Carry on conversations with incoming callers from up to 33' away from your Bluetooth-enabled mobile phone using this Jawbone Jambox 40209BBR Bluetooth speaker that features noise/echo reduction and DSP technology for crystal-clear audio.


..

6006840060008 I love the portability of the jambox and the sound quality is great. I just wish it was louder. The sound doesnt quite carry through at parties

..

6006840060008 
Control your mobile phone wirelessly using this Jawbone Jambox 39115BBR Bluetooth speakerphone, which features a call answer/end button for simplified use. DSP technology and noise echo reduction ensure clear audio transmission.


..

6006840060008 The bass is awful and sound quality is rather poor. The BIG JAMBOX sounds much better. This one does't live up to its price tag.

..

6006840060008 I had heard mixed reviews about the Jambox so I finally decided to give it a try. This is probably the worst sound I have ever experienced from a smaller bluetooth speaker. It sounded like a tin can. The buttons would stick together & the unit itself felt cheaply made. I don't know if I was unfortunate in the model I had, but it was simply awful. I would go with the $99 JBL Flips and actually get good sound for a much cheaper price. Take my advice and go listen to it yourself before buying. Everyone's ears are different.

..

6006840060008 My device starting to fail. After searching the internet it turns out this is a common problem with the jambox, where the soldering on the usb connection makes it believe it is connected fails the bluetooth connection. After talking to tech support with Jambox, they acknowledge the same problem but their replacement policy is bad. Be prepared to be hassled and ship your product first and then wait for a replacement. Others have complained that their replacements show up faulty as well. If you want this product, go online and check out youtube to how to properly solder the connection back or prepare to have a faulty unit.

..

6006840060008 The power port inside the box broke after 45 days. The box is now unuseable.

..

6006840060008 I really want to love this product. And I did, until about a month ago. At that time the connector for the USB charger became loose. After some research, I discovered a massive amount of similar complaints/issues. To be clear, my unit was never dropped or handled roughly. The Jambox has a know design flaw with this connection. My unit was 11 months old so it was still under warranty. I had to ship the unit (at my cost) to get a refurbished Jambox (not even my purchased color). I am still waiting for the replacement. Buyer beware.

..

6006840060008 Got it for streaming mp3s and no hands calling in car. Barely could hear it over road noise. Requires constant re-mating if phone is disconnected.

..

6006840060008 I bought it one year ago, and it has been working fine. Sound is great, bluetooth setup easy. Very easy to carry it around on trips, so I do not have to connect my iPhone to other people's speakers.
I am not sure what the "software updates" are about as this is just a speaker. (New voices and such?) I did not try it because the update asks me to enter my computer password. This is akin to giving your contractor the keys and leaving home. Unless the software update is to your computer operating system, you should not have to enter a computer password.

..

6006840060008 I bought one of these the other day for work. I'm not allowed to wear earbuds but I can have a small radio. So I bought this to plug my Creative Zen MP3 players into at work. I listened to it at Best Buy and was surprised at the sound quality with a demo IPod. I took it home and charged it and took it to work the next day. I plugged in my MP3 player and started listening to music. It sounded like junk. The sound was all distorted and the louder it went the worse it got. I turned it to an acceptable level so I could atleast listen to music while I worked. The speaker lasted about 5 hours on a charge and it was dead. I took it home and charged it again and the next day at work same deal 5 hours and the speaker was dead. I work 10 hour days, kinda hard to make it with no music for 5 hours. I did try a coworkers IPod with the speaker and it did sound better. It must have to do with the quality of ITunes Music versus Creative Labs ability to rip music at 320kbs for better quality. Either way, the Jambox was returned. As I was leaving Best Buy I noticed a grey and green box with a speaker called Goal Zero Rock Out Speaker. I looked at it and saw it was like the jambox but for $25 not $150 and the box said it lasts for 40 hours of playing on one charge. I took it home and plugged in my MP3 player and was really impressed with how much better it sounded than the jambox and you can plug in multiple speakers with no effect to your MP3 output.

..

6006840060008 I thought that the Jawbone JAMBOX where very unique in design. And have a nice sound for only having two speakers in them, the bass is great if thats what you are looking for (more than base then the beats The Pill). It also has a unique battery regulator that appears on your phone to let you know how much battery is left in it without having to guess plus it lets you know on its own. Overall its a good device for it size but, could use a little more power in its sound.

..

6006840060008 Everything about this speaker is great for my needs. I use it when I travel and in my office. It's a very small speaker so for it's size it totally delivers. I purchased one for my parents as well and they are very happy with it's performance. Jambox may not be for everyone but it met my needs perfectly.

..

6006840060008 
Take calls from your mobile phone wirelessly with this Jawbone Jambox 39116BBR Bluetooth speakerphone that features DSP technology and noise echo reduction for clear audio transmission. A call answer/end button allows simple control over your phone.


..

6006840060008 This speaker has really nice sound but I cannot get it to go loud enough to hear it from room to room. Also, syncing to IPhone and Surface Pro was a snap but still having a problem with my son's android phone

..

6006840060008 I picked this up on clearance at a local BB store. I needed a mobile speakerphone for webinar purposes, and got this after returning a "Monster" branded model which I returned (to a different retailer) due to poor sound quality of my voice being heard. The Jambox has performed flawlessly. Crystal clear both ways. My "good" review on range has nothing to do with Bluetooth - I rated it on how far you canbe from the speaker without having to raise your voice to be heard (about 8 feet). I use this with jawbone's The Nerd Bluetooth adaptor and a 2 year old Lenovo laptop. I would have rather had the new mini version of the Jambox for its compactness when traveling, but the $100 price savings on the original was too good to pass up.

..

6006840060008 Bought this little guy for my mom, and she absolutely will not share it with anyone. she uses it for everything, phone calls, music in her car, pandora, and uses it for her ipad so that she can have better sound for when she is reading her e-books. if you are going to use this speaker for a party or having people over, i would highly recommend getting the Jawbone Big Jambox because that is going to have the crazy huge sound that you will want with that, and for more personal use, get the jambox. She loves how she can take this EVERYWHERE with her.

..

6006840060008 This little thing has rocked my world. To be honest, I had been eyeing it for quite some time at my other favorite store, who shall remain nameless (Best Buy didn't have a demo to play around with).
At that store, I played around with the demo numerous times, however remained suspicious as the sound was VERY good: Full, Rich, Crisp and Clear. I thought, for sure, this was not accurate and that it was surely rigged; particularly because it was so small...
We all learned in science class, back-in-the-day, that bigger sound required bigger hardware. Period. Not anymore!
The Jambox is my first foray into the land of Bluetooth speakers (yes, I'm slow to adopt new things, because I'm so particular aka "picky') and it certainly did not disappoint. In fact, after I opened the box, it EXCEEDED my expectations.
Firstly, it's heavier than it looks (that was strangely reassuring to me), secondly, it only has 4 buttons, thus it is impossible to be confused about it. Out-of-the-box, the sound is brilliant, but when you enable this miracle called "LiveAudio", well, you have a whole additional level of richer and fuller sound at your disposal. All the tones, nuances from deep bass to higher treble are clearly audible.
Also, you can easily enable or disable this feature. Of course, it comes with a charger, audio cable and a suede-like sleeve to protect your new friend.
Furthermore, when you connect your new little friend to your computer, it will update itself, you can change options, and you can enjoy optional add-ons to make the sound experience personalized. Truly. Epic.
Fear not the price, as I did, because you're getting your money's worth for sure.
EPIC sound in a fashionable little box. 'nuff said.
Enjoy.

..

6006840060008 For my use this is a great speaker and love that it comes in a variety of colors. Love listening to my tunes in the kitchen while cooking. I can put it in my office and set the music I want to listen to vs using the radio.

..

6006840060008 I am still looking for the right portable speaker that will satisfy my specific needs.
It is a tiny speaker, and for its size it has the better sound overall compared to the Jabra SOLEMATE and The Pill by Beats but it has the disadvantage that it is not loud enough, on the field it gets behind the 2 other speakers.
I like to take it all over with me and where it fails the most is in the shower, I cannot hear it when I am taking a shower. It is simply not loud enough.
If it is sound quality what you are looking for, this tiny speakers sounds great at any volume level, but if you need more power, you need to keep looking as I am right now.

Monitor your fitness, sleep and nutrition habits with this Jawbone UP 39907BBR wristband that tracks distance, calories burned, active time and activity intensity, as well as sleep patterns and nutrition to help you achieve and maintain good health.


..

6006840060008 Overall, it's a great product! Does exactly what it says it will do. Great for tracking stats to help one get in shape. It's easy to use & does all the transferring instantly upon connecting to your phone/tablet. The biggest complaint that I have is that it's taking a little getting used to sleeping with it on to measure sleep habits. I'm sure I'll eventually get used to it being on at night & won't even notice that it's there.

..

6006840060008 It's interesting and even motivating to see how many steps you take in a day. Having a goal inspires you a little bit. And it's interesting to see how much and how quality your sleep was.
But the things don't last long. I and 4 friends got one. One person's wouldn't connect right out of the box. She had to replace it immediately. Another friend's lasted about a month before it stopped working. Mine wouldn't hold a charge after 2 weeks (my free replacement is in the mail).
Luckily Jawbone is really nice about replacing your stuff. And maybe the new generation will be a little more reliable. But this version of the Up doesn't hold up well.

..

6006840060008 Do not waste your time and money on this product, like I did. I purchased a blue UP and it stopped working after 3 months. I am still waiting over 3 months to get a replacement from Jawbone. After reading other posts on this product leads me to believe that there are major defects with this version (similar to the previous version). If you are considering purchasing an UP24 (the new version), I would wait 6 months and read the reviews. Now, I have a $130 useless wristband. Inferior product + poor customer service = unhappy customer.

..

6006840060008 Excellent product. Ease of use. Great prcess to assit me in achieving good health.

..

6006840060008 Got one because my wife has one so we can track each others use.

6006840060008 The Jawbone UP is a great item. I'm buying one for my daughter

6006840060008 I enjoy being able to see the physical activity that I have done each day and the amount of rest that I have had.

6006840060008 my brother likes it. .Whenever he does exercise he wears it, kinda enjoy this product.

..

6006840060008 Most people did not believe how poorly I sleep and how active I am and was able to show them. I love being able to track what I do each day and control what i eat and ensure I drink more in a day.

Monitor your fitness goals and sleep patterns with this Jawbone UP 39910BBR wristband that tracks distance, calories burned and activity intensity levels, along with hours slept and deepness of sleep levels, to help you achieve a healthy lifestyle.


..

6006840060008 My purpose for buying this device was to track the amount of sleep I get each night. It takes a long time for me to fall asleep most nights and I feel like I wake up often so I wanted something that could tell me how much sleep I'm really getting each night. This device does exactly that it tells me how long it took to fall asleep, how many times I woke up and it measures my light and deep sleep. The accuracy is a little questionable sometimes, but if your like me and just need to have a general idea this device is great for that plus I also get to see my activity and I can track my eating which helps with my digestion issues.

..

6006840060008 The jawbone UP band is a great motivational tool to keep you active. It keeps a pretty accurate account of your movement for the day and shows you when you need to get off your butt & get more active. The thing that surprised me was how accurate the sleep tracking was. The one downside is when you are exercising in a set position it doesn't track that. Any mat based exercises doesn't register. I have been very happy with mine

..

6006840060008 I love my up band because it motivates me to move, eat right and workout. I would recommend it to anyone that A. Enjoys keeping up with their body an how it functions. What I like about it most is that you wear it with pretty much anything and the colors are a great for everyone.

..

6006840060008 I absolutely love my UP band! It tracks your sleep patterns (deep & light sleep) and how long it takes to fall asleep. It tracks your daily steps and activity level. It also logs foods but I use My Fitness Pal and that app syncs to the UP app so it is really nice. Run Keeper also syncs with it. Great way to really get to know yourself and your daily habits. You can network with friends on the app. Make sure to use the size chart, I had to return my small for a medium, the small is really small. Works great so far, no complaints. If you are not used to wearing a watch, it may take a while to get used to something on your wrist but I adapted quickly.

..

6006840060008 I like it because it's easy to take off and put on, easy to use. Very simple. Gives pretty accurate feed back. I like that there are other apps that can be used with the UP to help you track meals, calories in, other types of workouts, etc...

..

6006840060008 I love my jawbone up. That is until it stopped working 15 days after purchase. Jawbones customer service is great and I had a new one with in a week. I'm concerned that it might be a continued fail though based off of forums. It's a fun technology that gets you moving when it works. But when your band dies its a bit of a bummer...

..

6006840060008 So much fun to be woke up at different times throughout the week.
Great step counter.
Has a wonderful calorie counter with all foods.
So much fun. Wonderful. Love color.

This Jay Turser 200 Series 6-string full-size single-cutaway electric guitar features 2 humbucking pickups for high-quality sound. The volume and tone controls permit simple audio customization.


..

6006840060008 The flame maple and carved top, with all the chrome trim, makes for a fabulous looking guitar. It stays in tune even after a good flailing, thanks to nice tuners and bridge setup. The tone is weak in clarity, but good for high gain sounds. Order up some hot pickups and you'll have the sweet sounds of a two thousand dollar guitar and the looks to match.
Mine looks nicer than my other eleven guitars.

6006840060008 I bought this speaker a few weeks ago and I have been using it every single day. the sound is great for such a small speaker, charges real quick, easy to pair with laptops, phones, I took it to the park people came to me saying where was the music coming from I had it on the floor cause we where cooking out family members where like wow where did I get the small but great sound speaker at best buy so yea it was load not bad at all speaker specially the price I also have the flip from jbl great speakers

Big sound, long battery life and a powerful charging station for devices. The JBL Charge delivers unsurpassed portable audio performance from your mobile devices and tablets. It provides more than 12 hours of playback time from its built-in, high-capacity, 6000mAh Li-ion rechargeable battery, and it can even charge your other mobile devices on the go via its built-in USB port. With two 1-5/8-inch (41-millimeter) full-range drivers and a built-in bass port, it produces full-range JBL sound with exceptional bass. It also wirelessly streams audio from any Bluetooth-equipped smartphone or tablet. The JBL Charge wireless speaker is a portable audio powerhouse for any environment.


..

6006840060008 I compared this with other devices, it came down to that JBL or. Bose Soundlink 2. This wins hands down, great sound for less money. The unit is well built and holds a charge for hours

..

6006840060008 I love bluetooth technology because it keeps getting better and better, and this thing is another example. First of all...you simply can't go wrong with JBL sound. JBL sound was top of the line and kicking' butt back in the 70's and 80's, and they are still going strong. I got this as a gift for my wife and now I'm using it. Such a great price for the quality of sound. It charges pretty quickly and it also has a USB port that enables you to charge your mp3 player while you listen to music. The charge feature is slow but when your mp3 player is dead, like mine is every time I go to use it, it will give it enough juice to keep the music going. For the guys, it's built like a tank, for the women it's simple to use and set up. I highly recommend this unit!!

..

6006840060008 I use this speaker on a daily basis and definitely recommend purchase.

..

6006840060008 This wireless speaker has far better sound than any other wireless out there including Bose. This JBL rocks!

..

6006840060008 For the size it is a great speaker, we take it practice and the whole field is jam'n!

..

6006840060008 Bought mostly for camping and sitting at the beach. Battery lasts a long enough that I don't remember when I last recharged it, so I charge it. And it still works! Syncs really easily to my iPhone 4s. I recommend it if you need sound on a small patio, tailgater, or a radioless boat.

..

6006840060008 I usually do a lot of research before I make a purchase. I definitely wanted something with a speakerphone that would allow me to listen to music, answer calls and have a little more freedom of movement while I did whatever I needed to do. The setup is very easy and the sound is great.

..

6006840060008 My overall experience with it has been great. I did choose this item over the over expensive beats audio it sounds better than that brand. For the price of it I think it is great. Other speaker devices are overpriced for the quality of sound they produce. This product is reasonable with the price. I also like how it is small and looks nice. A plus is that it can charge your phone if you are not near a wall port. Either way I have enjoyed it :)

..

6006840060008 Very happy with my purchase. After listening to many with in the store, this had the best sound for the price.

..

6006840060008 the sales person allowed me to test several while in the store some had better sound quality and others were not as good but for the price i feel the charge gave the best bang for the buck.

..

6006840060008 Needed new speakers to attach for laptop for watching movies, etc. I don't hear well, so I need external speakers. Works great.

..

6006840060008 Problems from the start. Sound was breaking up due to internal loose wire or bad connection.

..

6006840060008 the speakers sound good, and the balance adjusts well. but there is no way to adjust bass nor treble.

..

6006840060008 The sound is great ... when it actually plays. It has an auto-off feature that kicks in only after a few minutes but requires a manual adjustment every time. After only a month this has now turned into a short in the speakers and only plays for a few seconds at a time. Extremely disappointed since the price is higher than direct competitors. Stick with Logitech or something cheaper than this.

With a satin-copper-colored base, this striking and powerful blender is the best choice when it comes to drinks, soups, sauces and dips. The 500 Watt motor spins razor sharp blades that handle virtually any food, even ice. The electronic speed control and a pulse option allow you to have total control over the consistency of your final product. Simply fill the 50oz glass jar with your favorite ingredients and blend it with a simple push of just one button. Features are backlit control buttons for great visibility and a detachable stainless steel blade for easy cleaning.


..

6006840060008 Blender operated great for me until about a year of using it probably a dozen times. The glass jar had a defect causing it to fracture around the base during operation and as a result destroy the motor from the liquid leak. The company would not replace it.
For the cost of the product I would have thought the customer service and warranty would be solid. I found out they were both a joke. The warranty only covers the motor for 1 year and nothing else. Even if there is a defect and the other parts of the product break you have to fork over the money to replace it no exceptions and the costs for replacement are a joke, even if it falls within the 1 year period. I would expect this type of warranty and service out of a cheaper product.
Don't make the same mistake that i did buying this product. It is a waste of money. The blender works but if it breaks be prepared for a company that doesn't stand behind their products.

Purchased to use with Apple SuperDrive for MacBook Pro with retina as power specifications made device appear to be compatible. However, it would not support the SuperDrive. As powered from wall and not computer, external hard drives may stay on all the time, even when computer is shut down. Would only recommend if using with flash drives or mobile devices.

6006840060008 I absolutely love this backpack. Well, I guess I should say my wife does. She is a photographer and she uses this every time we do a session. We bought the backpack originally as a bag to carry around on an overseas trip we did. It was perfect for everything we needed. It was also her carry on for the plane. Everything we needed fit just right inside the bag. Great value, great performance, durable. Kata is a wonderful brand!

..

6006840060008 I just recieved it today, FINALLY, it was supposed to be here awhile ago. First off, although it holds alot, its ridiculously slow, i could have bought several $5 flash drives that hold 4gigs, and been much happier. Right now i am currently just trying to copy 89 pictures and a couple 3minute movies to it manually, its taken over a half hour, and im still waiting. and before you say it, i JUST got it, so i know it has enough memory. I dont reccomend this product, unless you have nothing else to do but sit here and wait.

..

6006840060008 I have Windows 7 64bit on my HP Pavilion laptop. It works fine with the 64bit. I use it primarily for music and just plug it into my car. It's much easier than plugging my ipod in. Good product. It's a 32gb usb, but it only allows for 29gb to be used. Now biggie, who really listens to that much music.

6006840060008 This has so far been one of the best coffee makers I have owned. 14 cups, programmable brew strength, and all the other features, make mornings bearable

..

6006840060008 i all way buy kitchenaid its very dependable and very good product

..

6006840060008 This coffee maker has been a real pleasure to use. Does a great job of making full 14 cup pots but also has setting to make smaller pots and does a great job doing that also. I would recommend it to everybody. It is not cheap but it is not cheaply made either and matches the rest of our Kitchen Aid appliances.

Blend your favorite hot or cold ingredients with this KitchenAid Diamond KSB1575CU 5-speed blender that features Intelli-Speed motor control that offers automatic blade adjustment for efficient blending, even as the density of the ingredient changes.


..

6006840060008 Love,love, love this blender. After researching ALL the different blenders I finally decided on the Kitchen Aid and I have not regretted it. Purchased a blender to mainly make smoothies and this blender does a great job handling veggies and even frozen fruit. Chops giant clumps of ice in seconds. Drinks are awesome! Was a bonus that I could order the color I wanted and got it on sale. I also took advantage of an extra bonus summer percentage off the price. From start to finish my shopping experience was a pleasure. When I picked up my blender it was carried to my car by a polite sales associate. Really nice since I have to walk with a cane. I will definitely shop Best Buy again!

..

6006840060008 I had smaller KitchenAid countertop appliances. I gave those to my son and upgraded to the larger ones. Love the blender, but be careful when you wash it because the blade and pitcher are all one piece.

..

6006840060008 Works great, arrived on time and powers through everything. Will turn ice cubes into snow. This will be the last blender you buy.

..

6006840060008 I use this to make smoothies out of frozen fruit and it works great. The motor on this is very powerful and I have had no problems at all with this blender. Highly recommended.

KitchenAid 4 Slice, Manual High-Lift Lever Toaster with LCD display with digital progress bar, extra-wide 1.5 inch slots which will accept the thickest bagels, breads or pastries, adjustable shading control which regulates browning of the toast, and a TOAST/CANCEL button.


..

6006840060008 This replaced an aging toaster and with the new features it has it works really good.

..

6006840060008 Needed a new 4-slice. Saw this one on a daily deal at really good price. Received in timely fashion with no package damage. Does a really great job on a variety of things one would toast.

..

6006840060008 Great overall toaster. Looks nice next to my stainless steel appliances. Love using the "bagel" feature to toast the tops of my bagel while warming the bottoms. Cooks levels 1-8. So far I haven't gone above level 3 or it will burn. Great buy!

..

6006840060008 I always like kitchenaid products. This is a great toaster

..

6006840060008 Nice wide spaces and a great toaster. Love the looks.

..

6006840060008 I would buy this toaster again for myself and as a gift.

..

6006840060008 Excellent toaster! Toasts your bread exactly how you like it

..

6006840060008 never have this quality. now I can toast my english muffins and heat cold French toast \s and waffles.

..

6006840060008 I picked this toaster up on a daily deal. It looks great and works great.

..

6006840060008 My grand kids make many of their own meals using this toaster. No more fighting for a slot and they can make whatever they want and it fits! Great purchase after living with an old 2 slice.

This stylish hand mixer features a 7-speed electronic digital control that includes two slow stir speeds and one high whip speed. Soft start electronic control adjusts to the resistance of what you're mixing for smooth, consistent operation.


..

6006840060008 This mixer feels flimsy and shakes during use in a way that my old, cheaper, but no longer made, mixer never did. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be anything better without taking a huge jump in price. So this one seems the best of a bad lot.

..

6006840060008 Got this for my wife to replace a hand mixer that was 20+ years old. Looking forward to 20+ years with this one!

..

6006840060008 
Grinder attachment greatly expands a stand mixer's flexiblity
Ideal for grinding meats, grating cheese, making bread crumbs and combining dips, salsas, spreads
Grinder can be used with any KitchenAid stand mixer
Includes fine and coarse grinding plates, tips, and recipes
Most parts dishwasher safe for easy clean-up


..

6006840060008 I like all the options for the kitchen-aid stand mixer.

..

6006840060008 The wife loves it! We plan on using it a lot. It'll be great for doing tomatoes..

..

6006840060008 Came home made ground beef and the best taco ive had... Fresh beef with better flavor...

..

6006840060008 This is one of least inexpensive accessories for a kitchen aid mixer, so it is a good starter accessory. Since other accessories can run in the hundreds of dollars,Mathis is a low priced starter accessory as you get accustomed to your new mixer. Best buy actually had the lowest price out of all the websites I looked at,so I was delighted to get it there!

..

6006840060008 Easy to use, works great with mixer, I love it alot

..

6006840060008 The electric grinder saves time over using a hand grinder, however you have to take the time to cut the meat into chunks that the grinder can handle.

..

6006840060008 This attachments fits perfectly, does exactly what you would expect of it. I had a little difficulty figuring out how to take it all apart for cleaning, but worked it out without too much trouble. We started at a lower speed and gradually worked out way up as needed. There is a certain amount of learing curve, but we caught on fairly quickly.

..

6006840060008 This accessory grinder for foot stand KitchenAid mixers is a great addition to increase the versatility of your appliance. It is easy to mount and easy to clean once you have finished. The plastic screw core makes it look a bit less durable than what would be expected of this brand.

..

6006840060008 If using Kitchenaid stand mixer, this a a great companion for more options.

..

6006840060008 Wonderful grinder, very quick attachment. This is a very good addition to my kitchen. A lovely workhorse.

KitchenAid 2 Slice, One-touch motorized lift control Toaster with LCD display with digital progress bar, extra-wide 1.5 inch slots which will accept the thickest bagels, breads or pastries, adjustable shading control which regulates browning of the toast, and a TOAST/CANCEL button.


..

6006840060008 Toasts for bread and bagels. It will burn if you use the top two settings.

..

6006840060008 I purchased this toaster 2-1/2 years ago. It's only received light use by one person on weekends. I bought it because of all the features and it looked great, so imagine my surprise when I went to use it today and it popped the GFI outlet. Thinking perhaps the problem was with the outlet, I tried using it on another outlet that is on a different circuit. Again, the GFI popped. Now I have a hardly-used, great-looking toaster that doesn't work. Am totally disappointed in this product and will not recommend.

..

6006840060008 This toaster looks great and works well, with everything you could ever want from a toaster. Crumb tray, bagel/"keep warm"/defrost/reheat settings, 7 levels of heat, mechanized lift (because pushing a lever is so straining on the hands), bright blue LED display with auto dim when not in use, and beeping when the toast has finished.
The complaints in regards to the beeping being too loud, is somewhat warranted, but nothing I found to be too concerning.
As to what it actually is supposed to do -- toast, well it does that fairly well. Better than any $15 toaster I've ever used, but not by much.
More like 3.5 stars but only whole numbers allowed here, so decided to round down.

..

6006840060008 This toaster works as expressed in all the documentation. It easy to use and also looks good on the kitchen counter. I would definitely recommend this toaster.

..

6006840060008 I love this toaster. Love the motorized lift mechanism, the bells that sound when toast is done (never had that before) and everything is toasted to perfection. I retired and like toast most days. I had to play around with level for browning to find the perfect shade, but for me it varies with different breads. I have nothing negative to say about this toaster and I have had plenty of them over the years. I simply love it!!

..

6006840060008 The toaster works very well. Just noticed once that the toast was browner on the outside, the same for both slices. But most times it seems to toast evenly. Other than that this toaster does an excellent job.
There is a single beep when the toast is done. Not annoying but seems unnecessary because if you're close enough to hear the beep then you're close enough to hear the toast pop up! But at least the single beep isn't annoying like I've read some other brands are.

..

6006840060008 It was well worth the wait and sure beats buying a cheap toaster ever 2-3 years this will last and is perfect for the decor in my Kitchen I also like the facts it Beeps as your toast is done so you know

..

6006840060008 it's nearly brand new but being a KitchenAid I have every expectation that it will be reliable over the long haul. I like that it senses the frozen breads and toasts them fully and the bagel setting that only fully toasts the cut side. No mishaps or problems so far.

..

6006840060008 This toaster had such great reviews and my only real complaint is that both sides do not brown evenly. One side browns nicely and the other side browns very little.
For the money spent, it should work much better.

..

6006840060008 Seems to work fine with two pieces of bread, but with only one piece it burns one side and barley toasts the other. We tried single slices in both sides of the toaster and there was no difference, and no, we didn't have it on the bagel setting. I ended up taking it back to Best Buy. We're currently using our old Black and Decker again, we have to watch it so that it doesn't occasionally burn the toast, but at least it toasts evenly! Didn't have it long enought to rate the Durability.

..

Bring homemade variety to spaghetti night when you use the attachments to make your very own linguine, fettuccine and pasta.


..

6006840060008 I bought this for a Christmas gift for a family member and they love it! Works great with the KitchenAid mixer they got last Christmas! Now they want even more mixer attachments!

..

6006840060008 A lot easier to make larger amounts for holiday meals!

..

6006840060008 I bought this for my wife despite the reviews of people not liking the product, not easy to use or too difficult to clean. We have not experienced any of those complaints. The rollers are terribly easy to use, cleaning is a bit of a chore but it really isn't that bad. I spend about 10 minutes getting all three attachments as clean as new.
Great product, works wonderfully as advertised and my wife was very happy with it. It was expensive but worth it thus far.

..

6006840060008 It's heavy duty and keep on going? Easy to use, hooks right up to most any kitchen aid mixer

KitchenAid Personal Coffee Maker with Optimized Brewing Technology and a small and tall design, perfect for any space. Removable water tank to easily add fresh water. 18 oz thermal mug and gold tone filter included


..

6006840060008 It's just alright. I bought it to stop drinking plain coffee out so it does the job, but I'm not thrilled with this purchase. It works as promised but I wonder if the water isn't quite hot enough to brew the coffee at a more desireable temp.

..

6006840060008 This is my second KitchenAid purchase. I love my new coffee maker. It's stylish, easy to use and I don't have to buy coffee filters anymore.

..

6006840060008 Having come from a $29 coffee maker with a timer that took way to long to brew, I was a bit concerned that this coffee maker, without a timer, would leave me standing and waiting for coffee. This was not the case! A 16 oz cup of coffee takes about 2 minutes to brew and after learning how much coffee to use, makes a great cup of coffee.
It is easy to fill the water each night and add coffee to the filter. I do have to pull the coffee maker out from under the cabinet for two reasons during this process. You add coffee by swinging the tray from right to left. I have a cabinet to the left so it would not open if I did not pull the coffee maker out on the counter further. Also, when I brew in the morning, there is a vent on the top rear of the coffee maker. Steam comes out of that and would saturate the bottom of the kitchen cabinet, which over time I could see being a problem. Pulling the coffee maker out from under the cupboard for brewing resolves both of these issues.
Previous cheap coffee makers would last about a year in our house. I am hoping this one last much longer.

The KSB560BW Tabel Top Blender has the unique pitcher shape, patented blade and powerful 0.9 horsepower motor provide fast, consistent blending that can crush a pitcher of ice within seconds. In fact, this model is the most powerful premium blender currently available.


..

6006840060008 Size is great to get job done. Pineapple juice was so much easier in this machine. LOVE the color great addition to my pink kitchen collection. Wish they had more

..

6006840060008 This is my first KitchenAid product. After my daughter had lower jaw surgery I knew that I would need a very good blender to prepare her meals. This blender is so easy to operate and clean. I love it.

..

6006840060008 Bought the blender for my mom and she loves it. She's making smoothies, shakes, and anything and everything possible. She is crazy about the color since her kitchen is primarily white so the tangerine is a nice splash of color. It came right on time.

..

6006840060008 I looked at several blenders online and in-person. I finally settled on the KitchenAid KBS560 for its design, technical specs, price and reviews. I use the machine to make iced protein drinks. The "crush ice" function does what it says, which is great for ice only. I use the "Stir" speed to make smoothies. It does a good job of crushing the ice at this speed without shooting the drink into the lid of the pitcher. The smoothie comes out super cold with only very small pieces of ice - the way I like it. The plastic pitcher seems durable and its mechanical parts fit tightly into the pitcher. There is no slack between the blender base and the pitcher either, which tells me that machine is engineered for durability. This is a good buy.

..

6006840060008 I am very disappointed with this blender. I read a lot of reviews and it seemed to be a great blender for the price. It is not. It barely blends basic smoothies and I can't believe how loud it is. I was trying to avoid spending $500 on a blender but so far I can't find one that can do the job spending less.

..

6006840060008 I love that there is one piece, it makes for easy clean up. Also since I have another KitchenAid product they look very stylish on my counter. I love the red color.

..

6006840060008 This blender was not on sale and still 1/2 the price of buying it in Canada. Great deal and great Kitchenaide blender

..

6006840060008 This is a great blender for daily use at home for fruit smoothies, salsas, milk shakes and more. I use this blender just about everyday and have owned several other brands and this is really the best I've ever used.

..

6006840060008 This blender is a work-horse. Whips up smoothies, margaritas, milkshakes without breaking a sweat. The blender jug is wide and light and easy to clean. The blender itself is heavy and very very solid. A great blender, and a quarter the price of a Vitamix or a Blendtec

..

6006840060008 I like the size of the pitcher. My old Kitchenaid is still working very well but the pitcher is too small for meal replacement smoothies, however this one is perfect.

6006840060008 I haven't had a camcorder for alot of years, but this one is very simple from the first time I picked it up. It has nice definition, and it's so simple.
I pop it in my purse and go, and it's great for getting videos of the family, because they are only smiling if they are short videos!
It's a nice price, too.

..

6006840060008 I chose this for shooting my swimming technique. I placed it in a variety of places from the pool deck to the bottom of the pool. It was solid in each area. The one drawback is the lack of a wide angle lens. But remember, it is a very inexpensive camera. Wide angle lenses are going to run on higher end cameras. The picture quality was magnificent and its ease of use is simple!

..

6006840060008 The Kodak ZX5 is a great out of the box camera. It was easy to understand right out of the box. Liked the Waterproof feature so when my daughter is Kayaking, she does not have to worry about it getting wet. The upload feature to Facebook or other sites was also great to quickly add information to sites. While the resolution is not the hightest in the class, it is good enough for quick videos for a device that slips into your pocket.

..

6006840060008 Use this to video offshore fishing in the Gulf. WOW!! The videos were great. Easy to shoot, and easy to hook-up to TV and replay. Didn't have to worry about salt water and fishing hands. Just rinsed it off. The best sdhc cards I've used in it are PNY Class 10's, 20mb/s. The sandisk extreme did not want to format. There are optional lenses available, and they work. The wide angle worked great on boat.

..

6006840060008 We bought our camera for vacation and love it!!! The only disappointing thing is that we could not use it to video inside some attractions because of lack of lighting.

..

6006840060008 
If you're going to live with no limits, you need a digital video camera that can deliver the goods in full 1080p HD. The KODAK PLAYSPORT Video Camera / Zx5 is up for the challenge. We built it to take on the most extreme lifestyles with an insanely tough design-we're talking shockproof, dustproof, and waterproof to a depth of 10 ft. And built-in image stabilization smooths out even the roughest ride. Whether you're carving up the mountain or pulling stunts in the skate park, the PLAYSPORT Video Camera / Zx5 is up for anything. And with a touch of the Share button, shocking your social network couldn't be simpler. Show the world why you're So Kodak. We dare you.Memory card sold separately.


..

6006840060008 This is a really fun device to play with, very versatile and easy to use. Do not expect something "professional" but this totally is up to the challenge to most of the other cameras out there.

..

6006840060008 Purchased to use during our Carribean vacation...even though it did lock up during usage at a show I managed to get in working condition in time for our sting ray and snorkeling outing. It worked to my expectation and then some!!! Easy to use; light weight and for the price what else can you expect??? Some other vacationers with expensive cameras were jealous :-) They had issues with batteries, view finder, ease of use and camera weight. Can't wait for next underwater experience!!!

..

6006840060008 Takes fast photo's, great underwater pics, Used it for a wedding and it took great video.

..

6006840060008 We purchased this camera because of its underwater capability (up to 3m) and use it during our Hawaiian vacation to film our snorkling excursions. It did great in filming land scenes during a variety of activities and the features and quality of video is outstanding. However, once I got it into the water, to film some great looking fish along a shallow reef, the camera froze up! None of the buttons would work and the camera would not turn off even after rinsing thoroughly in fresh water per the instructions. I noticed that the LCD display was discolored due to the seepage of moisture and the camera lens had water droplets condensed all over it. The camera also got very hot at this time. I opened the SDHC memory card door to get the flash card out and when I blew into it, a spray of water blew back onto my face. I finally got the camera to turn off by pressing the "reset" button per instructions found in the manual. It took over 24 hrs to evaporate all the water in the camera and return the LCD display to normal coloration. I was disconcerted by the fact that the user's manual anticipates this water leakage and gives trouble-shooting instructions on what to do--but that did not work! When I put the charger on the camera it again would not turn off unless I pressed the reset button. Also, the latch on the memory card door will now not close and is stuck in the open position. I went online and discovered that these symptoms are common to this camera (e.g., refer to reviews under "black" version of this camera). The camera is useless now and my only hope is to buy a separate memory card reader to extract the approximate 4 hrs of land video and still pics that are on the Class 10, 32GB memory card. If this does not work, then all our vacation activities (which included a helicoper tour, zip lining and sight seeing to beaches and the volcanoe) will be lost. By the way, our son bought the same camera and took it to Maui for their 10th wedding anniversay and the same exact thing happened to him: fine on land but once in the salt water the camera froze up. Fortunately, we were able to tell them what happened so they took HD video camera back-up with them (we did not). Do not buy this camera unless you intend to use it ONLY for filming HD on land for which it performs extremely well. The fair rating is primarily because this camera cannot be used for its advertised underwater use. Very disappointing and frustrating for a Kodak product. We are returning ours for a refund.

..

6006840060008 I bought this to take on my family's trip to Universal Studios and the Orlando area for vacation. It was extremely convient to slip into my pocket and carry around. Most people think it's a cell phone. I was fun to use in the pool and water parks. The battery life was decent and lasted entire days walking around theme parks. I stood in line with someone else who had purchased the black version before his trip and he seemed to be enjoying his.
The only complaint I have is the lack of a flash. The picture quality wasn't good under low light. I think a flash or some sort of light would have helped with that.

Sharing pictures has never been easier than with the M580 Digital Camera. Kodak's Share button lets you instantly tag pictures for uploading to YouTube, Facebook, Flickr and Kodak Gallery sites, plus e-mail too.Memory card sold separately.


..

6006840060008 I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday. He loved it! This camera had everything he wanted and it was at a great price. Tagging is great on it and the pictures are so crisp and easy to up load. Kodak easyshare is so much fun.

..

6006840060008 This was my first digital camera and was recommended by 2 few friends. It was very basic and easy to use. My only problem was when using outdoors on a sunny day I couldn't see anything on the LCD screen except a reflection of myself. It turned out that both of my friends had older versions of the EasyShare which also had viewfinders, but the newer version does not. I returned the camera and got a Canon with a movable LCD screen and a viewfinder.

..

6006840060008 The camera works very well. Sharp pictures and very little blurs. The only disappointment I had was that the commercial made it appear that the camera didn't have to be connected to a PC to load to wherever the user wanted to load it, which you do have to do once you've installed the software.

..

6006840060008 didn't like it. and my computer didn't like it. complicated.

..

6006840060008 Left in the camera, the battery goes dead in less than 3 days, have to make sure it's charged each time before you use it. My other Kodak cameras never had this problem. Also have to reset the time & date each time the battery dies. If you take the battery out, it stays up, so it's not the battery.

..

6006840060008 We had our first digital Kodak camera, CX7430, for almost 4 years, it was a great camera for only 4.0MP. We then bought a M1033, which we loved. It took great pictures and video, but ended up only lasting a year and a half. It stopped working and was too expensive to repair. So we bought this M580, and ended up getting our money back. The first one I had, had bad pixels on the view screen. It took terrible, blurry pictures. Also, had a hard time using the auto focus with room lighting. It took great pictures out in the sunlight. I decided to take it back and figured the first problem was a fluke, so I decided to try another one of the same model. It had the same problems!!! It seemed like a great buy, with lots of features for a low price, but it was just a terrrible experience and I probably will not buy another KODAK camera.

..

6006840060008 I bought the M580 to replace an old Kodak DX6490 4 megapixel model that I've used for 10 years and loved and to supplement my SLR. Took the M580 to Orlando for vacation and it took a few good pics and then stopped working. Maybe it was the humidity, but there's no excuse for the camera not powering on. When it decided to work again, the outdoor sunny pics were good quality, but not great. Indoor flash pics were not as good as my old Kodak.
I can't recommend this camera even though I'm a fan of Kodak. I'm returning it and will choose a Canon to match my SLR.

..

6006840060008 Overall I could rate this camera very high(IF IT WORKED)...I got this camera for my family vacation in June and it Worked AMAZING!!! I loved how easy to use...portable...GREAT pics! However.... a few days before vacation was over it stopped working (Would NOT turn on). I returned it to the store (had a two year warrenty) and they ordered me a new one and i got it a few days later. Took it home .... the pic quality was awful!!! Then one day it said " View obstructed, remove lens cap"......um! this camera has no lens cap!!! And then it wouldnt turn off! SO....I took it back again!!! I choose not to get it replaced and paid a little bit more for a Cannon Power shot SX120....its baulky but i have no complaints. great! i repeat GREAT!! pic quality and zoom. Video is amazing also. ...the Kodak is great if u dont want it to work when u need it and if u like to make frequent trips to the store for returns :)

..

6006840060008 My first digital camera was a Kodak, when that one broke I went to a Sony only to be disappointed, so for my next camera i went back to Kodak and got this one.
I am thoroughly impressed with this camera! The picture quality is excellent, I love the lens it uses. The camera is very compact and the 14 mega pixels is more than I need, and the zoom works great. The different scenes are fantastic, it has something for every type of shot I want. My favorite is the panoramic shot, It looks awesome and is really easy to use.
This camera is also very advanced, I love the face detection and the camera's ability to detect and tag faces, I also appreciate the fact you can switch between a red eye pre-flash or red eye digital correction.
Overall I love this camera, and I am very glad I switched back to Kodak!

..

6006840060008 I've had Kodak film and digital cameras for years and never steered away from them because of their great quality and ease of use cameras until i purchased this Kodak M580. I purchased this camera about 1 months before a trip to Las Vegas and because of my trust in Kodak i put the camera away for my trip and continued using my older Kodak camera ( not a smart idea on my part ). Trip came and the M580 came out with horrible grainy, blurry and out of focus pictures no matter what i did ! I tried different setting, tripod and even letting someone else take the pictures and nothing. I would say 7 out of every 10 pictures were unusable, which is odd because id never had a problem with a Kodak camera. I figured it to be defective and switched it out for another one of the same model and it to gave me the same results. So having had this bad experience with Kodak i decided to finally move on from them and i would SUGGEST YOU DO NOT BUY KODAK till they bring back the quality they once had.

Record special moments with this camcorder that features high-definition video playback for vibrant images and a Share button and pop-out USB arm for easy file transfer, so you can e-mail videos and photos to friends or post them online.


..

6006840060008 I like this camera, and have fun with it in the pool and in other water sports. The camera is not great, however, for normal use out of the water.

..

6006840060008 Great little cam ... The kids have had it in the pool at least 20 times. Works great when mounted in the car. Easy to use, easy to operate.

..

6006840060008 Water under the screen first time in water, kiddie pool. What a joke.

..

6006840060008 this work well for us and is our only vid camara (takes stils as well for a bonus). We can take vids on cards then store the cards with lables so we have a "perminate record" for insurance etc. Also take vids for fun and move the vids to the computer HD or to the clowd. I thought an internal HD would be a better deal -- not so you can get many hours of vid on a 16 gig card
Good value, simple to use, we like it.

..

6006840060008 Got this and the "non" waterproof Playful for my birthday. Took this one to mexico with us on our vaca, and it took great video outside and in the pool! I just wanted a reasonably priced portable water proof video camera, small enough to carry around for spontaneous videos, and that's exactly what I got! Easy to carry, Easy to use, took it on wave runners and got great still pics also! Love it for what it is.

..

6006840060008 I am a camp lead over the summer for a swimming camp and I let the kids take this into the water as a reward. They have to rotate turns so it's fair and they all really enjoy seeing hat they look like under the water. I think it is a great tool to have and have recommended it to many others already.

..

6006840060008 I received an email today requesting feedback.
This camera arrived very quickly and we were excited to use it. I trust Kodak. It was the only brand of camera that my parents bought while I was growing up and one of my favorite gifts as a child was a Kodak camera for my 8th grade graduation.
After taking video in a 6 ft depth pool for about an hour, the camera shut down. The instructions indicated that this is normal (???) and advise the customer to open all of the "doors" and leave it open to dry.
Done.
Fast forward one month.
The camera not only doesn't play the video taken on the first day, it doesn't work at all.
I am disappointed in the product. I would not suggest purchasing this camera to anyone I know.

..

6006840060008 Just okay. Just an average, beginner-type product. Don't expect it to last long for what I paid for it.

..

6006840060008 Used 1 time and the screen was distorted from water. Glad I got my SD card out and was able to save that.

..

6006840060008 I purchased this camera for my son for his 8th birthday. The first thing we did was take it to the pool, where he used it under very close supervision for nearly four entire minutes before it stopped working. There is water underneath the screen, inside the memory compartment, underneath the plastic lens cover, and everywhere else there isn't supposed to be water. This camera was a huge disappointment.

Get up-to-date weather information for more than 60,000 locations in the U.S. and Canada with this weather forecaster that provides up to a 4-day forecast, including chance of precipitation, hours of sunshine and wind speed so you can plan accordingly.


..

6006840060008 I should have researched this more before buying it. I wanted something that would give me (in order of importance) the outside temp, the inside temp, and a 1-2 day forecast. This does all that, but the outside temp isn't readily visible...you have to wait for it to scroll across at the bottom - AFTER the forecast or any weather advisories/watches/warnings scrolls across.

..

6006840060008 A little over-priced. Would prefer brown wood rather than red wood for the frame. It's a bit slow waiting for the words to roll across the screen. Otherwise, excellent info.

..

6006840060008 
This weather forecaster provides audible forecasts and plays your choice of news headlines, entertainment, sports and more so you can prepare for your day. 4-day weather conditions with daily high and low temperature forecasts help you plan accordingly.


..

6006840060008 Gave this as a gift and it was a big hit. Forecast and large display windows are nice features.

..

6006840060008 Have only had this product a couple of days. So far it's working great. Was very easy to set up and is very easy to use. One of the main reasons I purchased this was because I wanted a weather station that would display both indoor and outdoor temperatures. I checked out several different weather stations, and decided on this one. I should have checked the manufacturers website...the LCD does NOT toggle between time, date and indoor temperature as stated in the product description on the Best Buy site. That is my only complaint so far with this product.

..

6006840060008 My husband works in the snow removal business and this product lets us know what the weather is in areas other than our own. Saves unnecessary trips in the middle of the night!

..

6006840060008 I had been wanting a weather station for some time, and found this one after doing some research. It has a stream-lined, easy-to-read display that is not cluttered with lots of information I don't care about or even understand (barometric pressure readings?). It was fairly simple to hook-up to the internet and my router, and I was able to get it registered with no problem. It has the ability to report on five different locations (for a small fee good for the lifetime of the device), so I can keep up with the weather across the country wherever my family lives - very cool!
The audio forecast uses a computerized voice, which isn't too bad, but it is prone to clipping off the end of sentences and mispronouncing the names of cities and other words in the available audio feeds. Speaking of audio feeds, don't buy this for the news, sports, etc... feeds; the selection is poor and consists of the computer voice reading from short news articles. But if you want a desktop weather station with a small footprint, which also serves as a clock and calendar, this device may be for you.

With the LaCie CloudBox, you've got everything you need for storage and backup. Just copy and paste your most files to your CloudBox, and they will automatically be backed up online daily. It's that simple: your data is backed up on a local hard drive and again in the cloud for double protection. The CloudBox includes a one-year online backup contract for 100GB, which can be easily renewed.


..

6006840060008 I work from different locations and I often need to have my data available no matter what. This is why I purchased the CloudBox. Apart from a 100GB NAS drive with automatic backup software you get a very nice pro cloud backup service (also 100GB). I felt it was a pretty good deal. It's for sure less expensive than other cloud services that I've used in the past. The data is conveniently available anywhere in the world from any computer with a connection to the Internet. The data is encrypted and password-protected, of course. This solution is ideal for my work.

..

6006840060008 I purchased this network drive only recently, but I already feel very positive about it. After the files are copied to the drive, I can turn off my computer and relax. The Cloudbox automatically backs up my data to the Cloud after encrypting it (128-bit encryption). To set all of this up one doesn't have to have any specialist knowledge. The only thing one needs to do is to set up the software which is supplied with the drive. It's a very convenient and secure backup solution!

Style and set your hair with this Laila Ali LADR5604N1 dryer that features a soft bonnet and ionic technology to dry a variety of hair styles, as well as process chemical and conditioning treatments. An included case offers compact storage.


..

6006840060008 Compact hair dryer with bonnet is a great space saver. I purchased to replace my broken hood dryer. The bonnet dryer works great. It gets very hot and dried my hair quickly. The drawback would be the hose seem a bit short therefore making it hard to move around and turn your head while drying. Also the locking mechanism for keeping the hose attached to the dryer doesn't work very well. When turning my head while sitting under the dryer the hose became detached a few times. That was annoying because I had to keep placing it back in. Not easily done since the hose gets very hot. But overall it works great, its portable and doesn't take up a lot of space.

..

6006840060008 I needed something that can dry my hair quick. Well it works awesome!! I check out a few hair dryer and decided on this one. The color of is nice to look at. Laila did a good job on choosing the color of this dryer. It along with what it say it could do, sold me on it.. If you want a dryer that can travel with you and dry your hair quick, This is the Dryer to get. The only problem to me is the hose is a little short. Other then that Great Bonnet Hair Dryer!!!

..

6006840060008 A great product. I love it that I can move around while my hair is drying and not having to sit still.

This ceramic heater features 2 heat settings, a fan-only setting and an adjustable thermostat for custom comfort. The carry handle and compact size offer versatile tabletop or floor use.


..

6006840060008 I purchased this heater for my office. It definitely keeps me warm.

..

6006840060008 This is a compact heater which generates satisfying amount of heat considering its size. Because of its size it is very handy to be carried everywhere in the house. I purchased it to replace my old tower oscillating heater which only blows cool air without generating any heat (actually according to the online reviews this is quite a common problem for those types of heaters). It does not have tilt protection though, but that is not a problem for me. However, comparing with my previous tower heater, I will have to put it on top of a stool to heat up the area about half of my height. But consider its price, it is quite worth buying.

..

6006840060008 Great product. I use it in living room in an apartment and within 30 min to 1 hr it heats up the room with from (67 to 72F). Less noisy than other traditional heaters. Very comfortable when using it during night times when you need to sleep in your room.

..

6006840060008 Great for a small space,can be set to a certain temperature so it doesn't overheat. Is easy to operate and move from place to place

..

6006840060008 Produces the perfect amount of warmth for a bathroom without central heat. Compact size makes it unobtrusive when not in use.

..

6006840060008 This little heater is well worth the money. It is small, even smaller than expected but boy does it warm a room. It gets the room so warm sometimes I wish it had a timer. I use it in a one bedroom apartment, and it gets the rooms pretty warm ( the main room that it's in and any other rooms with doors open). I can have my apartment's thermostat turned down and as the room warms up the thermostat shows the temperature is increasing. Great investment, and even with a cold winter my electric bill is to my liking.

..

6006840060008 I bought this for my daughter to use in her apartment. This heater works great in a small area.

..

6006840060008 its a great product to have and it heats up pretty quickly. can save heating costs. easy to use,

..

6006840060008 it is a great little heater I would tell others its a good heater for a small room

..

6006840060008 Despite the low humming noise it makes while working, this heater does a great job heating up a room! No need to max it as it will get very hot! And the thermostat works wonderfully. Definitely recommended!

..

6006840060008 
Stay warm with this heater that delivers concentrated warmth for a comfortable personal space with automatic overheat protection and a cool-touch housing to protect your home.


..

6006840060008 Compact in size, fair price, arrived within promised time. No set up required other than finding right spot to position it. Good value for money

..

6006840060008 I bought this heater to set on my desk at work. Its quiet, very small, and perfect for a desk top. For the price, it was a really great purchase. Keeps me warm while I work. The only thing that would make it better is if it had a few more features like a high low switch, and possibly an auto shut off safety feature. Otherwise, excellent little heater.

..

6006840060008 I just purchased this drive to use with my Lenovo IdeaPad Yoga 13. The description says it was designed for the IdeaPad notebook, which is why I chose this one. It comes with Corel Burn.Now software to be used for burning CD/DVD's, however, the software is not compatible with Windows 8! I verified this with the Corel support representative who suggested I purchase a different application. So, I will likely return this product to get something that comes with a compatible user interface application.

As a business professional on the go, it's important that you ensure the work you do on your netbook or notebook is secure and protected. And with a busy lifestyle, there's no time for the hassle and complexity of a traditional backup solution, and no room to carry an external hard drive and cables with you. Developed with this in mind, the Lexar Echo MX backup drive is an easy-to-use, ultra-portable drive with capacity meter, which provides a convenient way to quickly and automatically back up and protect your files on the go. The drive is available in 8GB, 16GB, 32GB, 64GB, and 128GB capacities.


..

6006840060008 I bought my Lexar Echo MX USB drive primarily for storage capacity. With 128GB, it more than fulfills my requirements for a flash drive. I don't use the backup software so I can't review that aspect of my purchase, but I'm sure it works fine. I believe it came formatted in the FAT32 file system, but I formatted it anyway using the HP USB Disk Storage Format Tool,, v. 2.1.8. See my review of the Lexar 64GB USB drive and Windows 7/exFAT/FAT32 file system issues for USB drives larger than 32GB. It wasn't that long ago when an external hard drive requiring a USB cable had a 16GB limit, so technology has come a long way in a short period of time.
If you're looking for a quick, easy, lightweight backup/storage option for your laptop (or even desktop, if you still use one), you can't go wrong with this device. I don't really like the sliding cover for the connector so I use a cap from another USB flash drive to keep it protected. The storage indicator bar showing how much space you have used and have left to go is really helpful, as well. If you think the $140 cost is pricey, consider that this USB drive originally cost $500 when it first came out.

..

6006840060008 I bought this TV for the basement to watch it during the workout. Initially I was upset that this TV does not have an audio output - usually LED TVs don't have good speakers - but this one is producing a pretty good sound. The picture is very good too. Simple remote control. Does what it supposed to.

..

6006840060008 Used as a reception area TV so we're probably not too critical. Only issue is the wall mount on the back of the TV is recessed so my existing mount did not work. I had to buy a new mount (costing 25% as much as TV!).

..

6006840060008 excellent low cost choice. good picture despite low pixels. cheaper then local sears too.

..

6006840060008 I needed a low cost TV for a family member and this one was perfect. Looked good and worked great.

6006840060008 This is our first move to a LED TV and we like it. We started out with the 22", but found it was just too small, then the 32" came up on sale at only $50 more so we bought it. It is hard to evaluate the HD features of this TV as we do not have HD on our cable and have not watched any HD movies via our computer. There is an HDMI port to which I have hooked up my computer to watch a movie (non HD) and it worked great. For some reason our DVD player will not work with this TV, but it could be because it is so old. I find the picture a little dark at times and have switched preset types (usually on cinema and vivid, sometimes standard). I have not experimented with the color beyond that as it seems fairly complex. I really haven't noticed the visual blur you can get with a 60Hz LED TV (there was a fair amount of visual blur on the 22", also 60 Hz). I have watched the Super Bowl on it as well as the Winter Olympics. (I do not know if HD sports will have more blur as I haven't watched any HD sports so far.) So, if you are looking for a less expensive TV with a good to great picture quality, then this is the TV for you. Before I bought this TV I researched manufacturers and LG came up as one of the better ones in Consumer Reports. So far I have not been disappointed, but it has only been 3 weeks. There are the following connections available: component/composite, HDMI, USB, and cable/antenna (RF). There is no connection for external speakers or headphones. The reason I rated the features at 3 is because there is no connector for headphones/external speakers (when it was advertised as having them) and there is no direct internet connection, you have to access through your PC.

..

6006840060008 Easy to set up, great picture for the money and can find nothing wrong with it. Has good number of inputs.

..

6006840060008 Gift for family a great price wish I would have got bigger love the picture good quality

..

6006840060008 This tv is great for a bedroom when it isn't in that much use. It is overall a good product for the money!

..

6006840060008 I first tried a Vizio 32" --very poor quality; tuner very poo functionr with a cable box; --returned it
The LG is a first class set; well built; excellent electronics

..

6006840060008 This TV is perfect for those wanting basic functions for a TV located in a secondary room. Has pretty good picture quality and average sound

Take your Apple iPhone 4 or 4S with you wherever you go in this LifeProof case that features a full IP-68 rating and has been designed to military specifications to ensure protection against water, dust, impacts and shock.


..

6006840060008 This does what it says. I've jumped in to a lake with my phone in my pocket and my phone is perfectly fine!

..

6006840060008 Other than screen cover bubbles it does what it's suppose to.

..

6006840060008 This is actually my second one, the last one was with my iPhone and I left it on the back of my truck, I found my phone about a mile down the road and was ran over more than once and in the rain,, the cover protected my phone with minimal damage, highly recommend this case.

..

6006840060008 I'm happy with the case. Phone seems protected. I've put it through it's paces (short of throwing it on the ground) and the phone hasn't had any issues. The case takes the brunt of everyday use and looks to protect against occasional extreme missteps as well.

..

6006840060008 This case helps you not to worry about getting your phone wet or if you drop it. It's not that bulky and fits in your pocket. Price is a little high but it is worth it.

..

6006840060008 What an amazing product. Lost my iPhone5 by dropping it in the ocean, so I now use Lifeproof! This is an awesome case and it is 100% genuine. Sooooo many fakes and counterfeits on eBay. Yes it is about $80 bucks but how much is a new phone? BUY THIS CASE AND IGNORE ALL OTHERS!

..

6006840060008 It was easy to put together. My son loves the color. It seems to be holding up great! I can't always hear when a call or text comes in but volume is fine when talking. Overall great value and seems to do what it says!

..

6006840060008 My son bought this case to protect our old iphone that was given to him and it has been a great investment.

..

6006840060008 Worth the cost. A couple of years ago my oldest son jumped in a pool with his phone in his pocket and no lifeproof case; ruined the phone. A week ago my youngest son did the same thing with this case on his phone and no damage done.

..

6006840060008 Life proof case works great. Underwater pictures are awesome!!

..

6006840060008 Won't do sentences, Not much good to me now for what I need it for.

..

6006840060008 I bought this in preparation for my trip to Thailand. Figured out how to use it to translate in to Thai from English (or to use it's canned phrases), but could not figure out how someone in Thai was to use it to translate back in to English for me!!

The LS-60 programmable communicating thermostat operates via a high-quality, easy-to-use touch screen. To program or adjust your LS-60, simply touch your finger firmly to the screen. The screen will automatically light up and you will hear a "beep." Do not use a sharp or metallic device; it will scratch the screen.


..

6006840060008 I do love this thermostat. Was about to pay the same price for one that wasn't even wifi compatible. I can set different programs for every day of the week or for a set of days. My old thermostat only would let you set a specific program for days, and then one other for weekends. I was always having to adjust the settings. I also think that the temperature gauge on it had expired. The temperature never seemed right. It was either too cold or too hot. This one seems to get it right. Follow directions exactly if you are going to add the wifi modlule. It can only be setup through Lockstate Connect. I tried doing the free route and no it does not work !! Finally I only gave it 4 stars due to the fact that there should be some sort of base around the whole unit. It looks strange when it's mounted.

Cool to the max:You can keep your cool thanks to the virtually silent, tilted fan with a large grill.Very comfy:More comfort when using your laptop on the couch, bed or floor.Low energy:The USB-powered fan uses minimal energy to help save your laptop battery for the things you want to do.


..

6006840060008 The product works as advertised and the price was right. Don't know enough about the differences in other cooling pads to say whether it would or would not be worth it to pay for additional features. From my perspective, this product works and that's what I was looking for.

..

6006840060008 My cooling fan helps a lot in keeping my computer from over heating.

..

6006840060008 Its easy to set up, your computer will work better, cause it will be always in a Good temperature.

..

6006840060008 This pad runs great! The fan is really quiet. It plugs into the computer for power. My husband liked mine so much he went out and purchased one for himself. I would highly recommend this product!

..

6006840060008 Had this for about 6 months. It worked great during that time, but one day it stopped working. The problem is that the cable is frayed by the selector switch. Have to play with the cable to get the fan to turn on.

..

6006840060008 3rd one i bought - they break kind of easy and so it's a little pricey for a piece of plastic

..

6006840060008 My laptop always ran hot. With this product, nice and cool. The cord stays out of the way. Laptop does not slide and stays put on my lap. Great product for the price.

..

6006840060008 It does what it is suppose to. Plus the bonus of being able to turn it off and on without having to disconnect and adjustable speeds are a very nice bonus.

..

6006840060008 I have used it both on a table and also used In bed. Works great to keep your legs cool by moving air around if the laptop is on your lap

..

6006840060008 Excellent at keeping your laptop cool and running efficient. Great price for the craftsmanship.

A laser mouse with hyper-fast scrolling and a keyboard with an integrated LCD give you the speed you need. And the control you crave


..

6006840060008 Well I owned this set now about 3 yrs. It is still working just as good as the first day out of the box. Ths cutomization for the keyboard and mouse are great. I have had to change the batterys in the keyboard once since i bought it, the mouse lasts about 5 days before you need to put it in the charger. I do really like this set-up for a desktop. Doesn;t work very well for laptop use. the keyboard is quite large along with the mouse. I does work on a blanket which was a nice surprise. It is a bit costly for what you get but if you purchase on sale then it is a good deal.

..

6006840060008 A lot of extra bells and whistles.(shortcuts) not necessarily for the non-geek, lol, but it does work great!

..

6006840060008 As a professional photographer, videographer and graphic artist of 48 years and a computer user since the Atari 1600, I can say I have never used a keyboard or mouse that was better than these. Well worth the money.

..

6006840060008 I love this product and it works well on my computer - had no trouble with set-up, but six months after purchase, the "mouse critical" power icon came up and after 24 hours of charging, I could not get it to stop sending me the message. E-mailed Logitech and since it was still under the manufacturer's warranty, they sent me a completely new set (including keyboard), no questions asked, and technical support was very helpful and pleasant to deal with. Another seven months goes by - same problem. Now it's out of warranty and I'm either going to have to purchase another one or buy a different model. Haven't decided what to do about that yet. It would also be helpful if the LED function on the top of the screen had some back lighting. Would recommend, but with reservations.

..

6006840060008 I use this setup to control my laptop while connected to my HDTV from across the room. Works well at distance (connectivity) but seemed to be a tiny delay with the mouse, which is fine for normal computer use but I play video games so the delay is painful. Very satisfied with the battery life on the mouse and the rechargeable nature.
Very satisfied with the setup.

..

6006840060008 I'm an average user and so far is been great in meeting my expectations but for the price should be better, in terms of the screen not being in color and while the lights are off hard to see the keys on the keyboard and screen! but mouse being rechargeable was a nice touch. Battery life is very good and if you have the extra money to spend I don't think you will find any better!

..

6006840060008 Gamers or people who have their computers connected to their TV need to get this keyboard/mouse combo. I'm like 10 feet from the computer and have no issues. The shipping was super fast to an APO, took like a week to get here.

..

6006840060008 Great keyboard and mouse. I'm connected with Bluetooth, and it works great! Initially I was getting some disconnect issues, but I played around with the computers "sleep" settings, and I'm happy to report that solved the issue.
The price is a bit steep, but you get what you pay for here. I had a MS wireless keyboard and mouse, and it had a radius of about 5 ft. which was worthless for my home theater setup. This keyboard/mouse puts my previous wireless setup to shame.
I've had this up and running for over a week now, and the mouse hasn't needed a single recharge even with heavy use. The keyboard isn't rechargable, but it appears it'll go roughly 180 days before needing new batteries (according to the on-screen estimate). Incredible!
Zero complaints other than the screen on the keyboard being nearly useless in a very dark setting... However, it works great in normal lighting.

..

6006840060008 This keyboard and mouse have worked without any problems. I have a new computer with windows 7 home premium 64 and the keyboard and mouse were very easy to connect.

..

6006840060008 The mx Revolution is an awesome mouse which is why I bought this setup, but it's old technology that doesn't use a micro usb to charge during use like the mx performance. The keyboard is pretty typical for logitech. Great feel and useful extras, but the whole setup at like $180 is far too much. A better setup is a g15 keyboard and a g5 mouse which is what I ended up with after returning these items. The wireless novelty just isn't worth it.

Change the grip. Change the weight. Customize the LEDs. Even use on board memory to take up to five mouse profiles with you to the next LAN party. In every way, the G9 mouse lets you tune for the way you play.


..

6006840060008 I am a fairly avid WoW player and I used a G9x for two years. The first year, the mouse was great! Suddenly, in the second year, the mouse began freezing and hesitating. After doing several on line searches, I found that others were experiencing the same issues. The wire that enters the mouse from the USB has a very bad habit of breaking and causing issues such as mine. I don't mind this so much in a $15 generic mouse, but in an $80 gaming device, I expect more.

..

6006840060008 I have been using this mouse for a long time now, and wanted to validate my initial thoughts of the product before writing a review on it.
What i use the mouse for:
First person shooters on the PC, and XBOX 360 (via a device called xim3), simple computer browsing and navigation.
Adjustable DPI: Being able to change the sensitivity on the mouse on the fly is a great feature and i use it frequently. I change my sensitivity (the DPI button) to max in games, and adjust the sensitivity in the game itself in order to achieve the best tracking and accuracy. Then i can turn it down a notch on the mouse if i want to navigate a computer and have more control with the mouse pointer and clicking on things. The button used to change the DPI is not in the way of accidentally getting pushed, and i think they placed the button in a good spot. This feature also works when connected to the xim3 for the xbox 360.
weights: In my opinion, as a first person shooter type of gamer, i like the ability to pick up a mouse and move it with ease. I found it easier to use the mouse without the included weights. some people may prefer weights for different applications like auto CAD though.
Interchangeable mouse covers: i can't see a benefit or downside of using one over the other. I believe this falls under user preference. I do notice that after some time of using the textured cover, that the texture will rub off.
adjustable mouse wheel: you can change the mouse wheel to either floating, or "notched" where it clicks into place if you slide it up or down. Floating design is good for applications that require lots of scrolling, and the wheel has great bearings and will spin for a long time if you let it. The notched or clicking setting for the mouse wheel is good for games as you feel it click once to change weapons, which means you have more control.
the side buttons: there's two side buttons near the thumb that are used for navigating forward and backward from site to site if surfing the web, or you can assign them to funcitons in games. These buttons i feel are the weakest part of the mouse. After semi-average use, there is no distinct way to tell that there is a forward and back button. it feels like one single button, and the button itself is real wobbly and feels like it is going to fall out. due to this, it's difficult to get the mouse to register which button you want, and you sometimes find yourself accidentally pushing the wrong one.
Overall, i feel this mouse is absolutely great for the price, and is better than the G500 due to the fact you can change the DPI on the fly as opposed to logging into the mouse software to change it like you have to do on the G500. The only down side is the side buttons near the thumb seem cheaply engineered and could have been made better.

..

6006840060008 The price is a little on the high side, however now that they dropped the price down to $80 instead of $99 it is better.
I have very large hands so the mouse is a little on the small side for me, but it is still extremely comfortable to use and is more comfortable than any other mouse I have used.
The mouse has a nice look to it, you can tell it is a high performance mouse but it is not so flashy that people will really notice if you use it with your work computer, unlike razer or cyborg mice...
The dpi selection buttons are easy to find and use without looking and aren't in the way like with some mice. The thumb buttons are also nicely placed. While sometimes i think it would be nice to have the profile select and microgear buttons on the top/side of the mouse for ease of access, it is nice that they aren't in the way and don't accidentally get hit during regular use.
Overall, the mouse is great, the woven usb cable is a nice touch as is the changeable led color.
The program that comes with the mouse is very easy to use, plus it is very nice to not have to set it up on every computer you hook the mouse to. My only other real complaint is that you can only adjust settings on the mouse from one computer without erasing the settings and starting over, this was annoying at first but once I got the mouse setup the way I wanted it was nolonger an issue.

..

6006840060008 Positives:
I don't use this mouse for gaming, but I usually buy gaming mice because I require more precision for what I do. I have small-medium sized male hands and tend to use a claw/finger grip and lift/swipe the mouse. I previously used the Logitech MX-300 and the G3, which fit my hands perfectly. This G9 mouse is slightly smaller than those but has more buttons and works well for me, as it has two grips, one that is more ergonomic and slightly bigger and one that is slightly smaller and more angular. The grips and weights are very easy to change. Both main buttons click excellently, the wheel has a nice ratcheting scroll (which can be switched off to allow smooth scrolling), the dpi buttons (which are reprogrammable) are placed well and click firmly, and the same can be said for the side buttons. The Setpoint software works great as usual and allows maximum customization and flexibility in and out of applications (important since I don't use the mouse for gaming, but for windows and application usage). The mouse glides and tracks like a dream.
Negatives:
I don't use the weights as the mouse is already relatively heavy - it is not a light mouse like the G3 or even the MX-300 which had a weight inside. They should've made the mouse lighter without the weights installed for those who prefer a much lighter mouse. The middle button is difficult to depress and doesn't offer a satisfying click. The microgear button (to switch from ratcheting to free scrolling) should've been placed on the top of the mouse for on-the-fly access. The mouse is too small for those with larger hands who use a palm grip, but is perfect for smaller/medium hands or those who use claw or finger grips. Logitech should've provided different sized grips so that everyone could find a good fit (both grips provided are basically the same size). The retail price of about $100 is way too high, IMO, esp since it doesn't come with more grips.
Overall
Despite some minor drawbacks, this mouse is excellent for those who have small-mid size hands and/or use claw/finger grip, and who require a very precise, slick-gliding mouse with many programmable buttons.

..

6006840060008 I had been using a cheesy Microsoft mouse for playing fps, My Logitech MX5000 mouse was horrible playing fps. I did pretty well with the cheap Microsoft mouse so I didn't think this would change much. Boy was I wrong. The first round of MW2 I played with this mouse my k/d ratio went sky high. Nothing can compare to how smooth this mouse works.
Once I dialed in the changeable weights it got even better.
Being able to create profiles for each of your games is awesome. As soon as you launch the game it will automatically load the mouse profile for that game including custom macro buttons.
The programmable macro buttons are also super helpful. If you u se 3 round burst assault rifles you can program the macro buttons to make them fully automatic.
Don't kid yourself this mouse is worth every penny.

..

6006840060008 after switch over 17 mouse, this is my final one, the 18th mouse for gaming.
A Good mouse is really required for FPS(First Person Shooting) gaming, after i had so many mouses, this is the one i have finally found that can work with my hand with the right speed, sentive, and comfortable. i will tell you EVEN if this mouse is selling for $199 and i will still buy it.

..

6006840060008 This mouse model has been around for some time. Now that the G9X model is out, this price makes the deal even better.

..

6006840060008 Logitech has another hit on its hands. I upgraded from the G9 mouse not expecting much of a difference but the are some minor improvements from the previous version, including a software feature called angle snapping that helps in moving the mouse in a straight line either horizontally or vertically. I love the high DPI which can be changed on the fly with ease. I also like the changeable grips, and my favorite is the textured grip.
The only bad things I can say about it are the fact that its pretty pricey, and having the microgear button on the bottom still isn't great, since I rarely use it due to its location. I wish Logitech had found a different location for the button, as it is in the same spot on the G9.
Overall I highly recommend this mouse.

..

6006840060008 i got this mouse because its fast and looks good. this mouse is not 5000 dpi. ITS 5700 dpi. it has three settings and 2 cover for big and small hands. it has weight asjustment to it and it has a front and back key when you are surfing the web

..

6006840060008 Coming from a G5, this mouse feels more accurate and smoother. I love the configuration capabilities and have customized it extensively for my needs.
One of the features I didn't expect to use was the ability to turn off the Indent on the scroll wheel. This has proved invaluable while writing software when dealing with several thousand lines of code! The Scroll of
The feel is extremely comfortable and the customizable weight is a must have! I set mine to the heaviest it can be. I just like the feel of the friction I get that way.
The cable is covered in a cloth mesh for added strength. If the longevity of my G5 is any indication this mouse should last for several years at least. This easily justifies the expense.

..

6006840060008 
When you're gearing up for battle, you never compromise. Not on your team, not on your weapons, and certainly not on your hardware. If you take your game play seriously, you want the Logitech G19 on your side.


..

6006840060008 I'm a gamer so I need the best gear. Logitech makes the best mice and keyboards, there is no debating that. The LD display lets you choose what you want to monitor, and reconizes profiles, such as call of duty, and 007 Bloodstone just to name a few. At $119.00 it is pricy, you can have a Razer at half the cost, but if you have the means get the Logitech and a Logitech mouse too, you won't be sorry.

..

6006840060008 Howdy,
The G19 is, by far, the best keyboard I have ever purchased. I built a flight simulator in the lower level of my home and the G19 was an excellent choice to add. I particularly like the lighted keyboard with G Tabs for quick access to flight controls. Also, the screen in the middle allows me to monitor the computer performance and keep track of the time in Zulu when I fly on Multi-Player with other Pilots.
My sincere thanks for an OUTSTANDING Product,
Roger

..

6006840060008 The keyboard is good but they could have done a better job on some of the profiles. World of Warcraft is very bland with only black and white lettering. One of the main reasons I got this keyboard was to watch movies or pictures on the built in screen while I was doing other things on the computer. After numerous emails back and forth, Logitech has acknowledged that this keyboard will not access media files located on a network storage device (NAS). All my media files are located on a western digital NAS so this keyboard refuses to acknowledge any of them. The only way I can play them is to directly copy the files over to my C drive which defeats the purpose of having a network storage.
With the popularity of lcd screens now days, this keyboard is way too expensive for the tiny little screen it comes with.

..

6006840060008 I love it. it does exactly what it is supposed to do. The background lighting on the keys is excellent. The color display is bright and very very handy in gaming.

..

6006840060008 I wanted to get this keyboard for 2 Months to upgrade from a Saitek Eclipse II. I love backlit keyboards so this was great for my desktop and I was getting tired of the eclipse that I've had for 2.5 years. The unit requires a separate power adapter for the lcd, the plug itself has a fat end like most routers/modems out nowadays .The KB looks amazing and you can change it whatever color you like, I loved the customization aspect. What was disappointing was that the KB isnt truly backlit (like for example Macbook Pro Unibody KB or Eclipse II) only the letters on the keys had illumination but not under the keys. It took me 30mins to realize why the KB didnt light up as bright as I thought it should. The LCD was not at all actually useful, there aren't any 3rd party apps or windows widgets/gadgets that are compatible with it. I thought it would be pretty cool to have the lcd, but realistically its not in your field of view which just makes it awkward. Setpoint software is needed as well as 2-3 more applications that must be installed and always running in the background in order for the lcd, custom keys and key color to work the way you want them to. If Logitech would partner up with Msoft for this, it would be somewhat better. Overall the software was pretty bad, eats up ram and core at all times and you must use the Media Browser with Media player, if MP is turned off the browser is useless. Another problem with the media browser is sometimes your movies and pictures open on the lcd screen when you dont want them to and its very annoying to turn them off. Dont plan on using iTunes when this keyboard is installed. Since it keeps WMP open at all times iTunes is a nightmare to navigate. Overall the G19 Is a very cumbersome keyboard because of SOFTWARE. I can forgive the power adapter because it actually feels good while typing, but the software kills any hope for this hardware to excel. Hope this was helpful to you

..

6006840060008 This is just a flat out great keyboard. It looks good, works well, and changes frigin colors! i also dig the macro keys (there are a ton of them).
key backlights are easy to see when gaming in a dark room.
acts as a 2 part USB hub which is handy for headset that use this connection as well as mice,r a MP3 player, or a flash drive.
my only beef with it is that it does not pitch up enough in the back for my typing tastes. in sure i will get used to it
also pricey, but you get what you pay for.

..

6006840060008 This keyboard has been by far the best I've ever used and does way more than I would ever need. I play online poker for a living, and it's really nice to have the 2" LCD display setup as my music player. It will display what song is next as well as what is currently playing on it's LCD screen. I find that beneficial as my monitors are generally covered in poker tables and it's nice to not have to interrupt my action in order to look up a song. Obviously this keyboard has some major functions designed for gaming that I will never use, but I highly recommend it to anyone just wanting a very nice keyboard.

..

6006840060008 I have had this keyboard for about a month now and I love the feel of it. This is my first "gaming" keyboard, so just getting used to having the extra two columns of keys on the left side of the board.
The LCD is great, depending on whether you want or need the info on the screen. If you watch your system resources (CPU, memory, etc), like to keep track of character stats, or if you are an RSS junkie, this is a good feature. I find that the movie watching and YouTube functionality of it offers little opportunity for use, but others may feel differently.
The keys are soft to the touch and don't make a lot of noise while you are typing. I am heavy-fingered and,with other keyboards, I have had several phone conversations where people commented on how loud I was typing. I don't have that issue at all with this keyboard. The keys are responsive. I have had none of the problems one of the other reviewers mentioned about keys sticking.
One of my favorite things about the keyboard is the back lit keys. I looked through several keyboards before purchasing this one. Many have the entire key panel back-lit which would make reading the keys (if you need to) more difficult. Only the character on the key is back-lit on this board. I also like that you have a tremendous color range to choose from and can bind up to three colors to the M-keys in the upper left corner of the board for when you just want a quick change of color.
The volume knob is nice. I like it better than the up/down volume keys on most keyboards. The mute button and media player control keys are all grouped together above the number pad, which is out of the way enough to not be invasive, but in a good enough spot to make them easily accessible without having to search for them.
The Windows-key lock feature definitely comes in handy for me. I have large fingers so mis-keying is a common occurrence. Nothing sucks worse than being in a boss fight or having someone in your cross-hairs and accidentally hitting that Windows-key, taking you out of the game.
I don't really like the height the keyboard adjusts to from flat. Would be nice to see either multiple heights or at least a little bit higher than what is currently provided. It's not much more angled than just being flat.
Should you buy this board? I think it depends on whether you are able to use and appreciate all of the functions of the keyboard. I have not really started using the G-keys yet (a little bit of a learning curve for me because I am used to binding macros to regular number or letter keys). I do not use the LCD as much as I expected, but just found some 3rd party software that may change that. Those two things being said, I don't have a full appreciation for the board just yet, but I definitely see the benefits. The comfort level for typing is really good (minus the limited height adjustment), but I am sure there are plenty of keyboards out there that are comparable. If you are a gamer and would make use of the G-keys, AND you would take advantage of the LCD fully, then this is a good board, otherwise you can probably find much cheaper alternatives.
I really like this keyboard and plan on taking full advantage of all of the features, so it's worth the money spent.

..

6006840060008 Keyboard has great feel for gaming, this keyboard does everything. The addition of ac. power gives you another upgrade over the g15. The color display sceen is actually quite useful in-game.

..

6006840060008 Keys get stuck, software messes up your computer, support sucks.

..

6006840060008 
There is sweat on your brow. And it's way too late to turn back. Everything is at stake. When you need to choose wisely, the Logitech Gaming Mouse G500 gives you a competitive edge with a gaming-grade laser, onboard memory, and weight tuning.


..

6006840060008 the mouseis great, the weight can be customized. The speed is very stable so you won't lose feel hard to control your pointer. It never lose frame.
Great with playing LOL and shooting games. In LOL, all the keys can be configured in the game.
Due to the big size, I don't recommend it for RTS gamers. My APM is 260+ and I prefer a smaller mouse such as G1 G100 or G100s for easier play multi-threads.

..

6006840060008 It is fast and smooth. Glad to be back on the logitech gaming mouse. The shape is excellent just like I remember. DPI indicator is useful.

..

6006840060008 This mouse has just the right number of buttons for games especially FPS games. The ability to adjust the speed on the fly is great when zooming in with a scoped rifle, slow and steady. The only thing I don't like about this mouse is the size, it's just a little small for my hand. Over all this is just the right mouse for everything and I will continue to buy this model whenever I need a new mouse.

..

6006840060008 It's a great gaming mouse with multiple useful buttons.
I like the dual-mode scroll wheel, super fast for web browsing and great for weapon switch in game.
The only problem I got so far is no response after computer booting. It may not be the mouse problem and re-plugging will fix it.
Wait, what's the point of this review if bestbuy removed it from stock list?

..

6006840060008 Great for any gamer, newbie or MLG PRO such as myself. Great mouse for MMO's and RPG's but a little to fast scroll for minecraft.

..

6006840060008 This is a very comfortable mouse to use. I still have not explored all of it's features yet though.

..

6006840060008 I love the feel of this mouse. It fits my hand perfectly and the weight is ideal.

..

6006840060008 I got this mouse to replace a dying Logitech wireless mouse to play games on my PC. I love the buttons to quickly select the dpi mode and the scroll wheel is wonderful, its nice to get back to the top of web pages when you're down at the bottom, it takes a little getting used to, but after a bit, you'll wish every mouse had it.

..

6006840060008 I have a Logitech MX500 that has lasted almost a decade and is still going strong. I purchased the G500 for an updated look and programmable buttons. It lasted 4 days before the sensor freaked out and would only work on the Y axis, wouldn't go left or right. The buttons stopped working as well. I plugged it into various USB ports and even a separate laptop with the same issue, it just bricked. I would expect a $60~ mouse to last longer than 4 days. While it worked, the DPI adjustments and programmable buttons were nice, but it wasn't that comfortable for me. I returned it to Best Buy and picked up the G700 instead. I like the design and feel of the G700 much better, so we'll see how long it lasts.

..

6006840060008 I was shopping around for an all around good gaming mouse and after going through several mice reviews between Razer, Steelseries, and logitech the G500 appeared to have the least negative remarks. So I picked up the G500 this morning and have been using it throughout the day. After installing the software I was amazed at the customization of the G500. If you choose not to install the software right away you can simply plug and play. The mouse has felt great to use all day and every button in my opinion just feels "right". I read a few complaints about the scroll wheel but I have not had any issue with it thus far. The DPI buttons are a great feature especially when you customize what DPI settings you want through the software manager. Mouse just glides over the mouse pad. I have no buyers remorse after purchasing this product, and would highly recommend to anyone wanting a great gaming mouse.

Enjoy a clear view of the display on your Apple iPad mini with this Logitech 920-005282 folio case, which doubles as a stand to allow comfortable hands-free viewing. The EasyType Bluetooth keyboard makes typing simple.


..

6006840060008 Love this product, it has meet and exceeded our expectations!!! I would recommend this to everyone!

..

6006840060008 It Safely secures IPad and Has A Great KeyBoard. Also keeps a great long battery charge!

..

6006840060008 I bought the keyboard folio the same day I purchased my iPad. I had been playing with a Surface tablet with keyboard that my school where I teach is letting me use and really liked the physical keyboard so I decided to get one with the new iPad. The folio offers outstanding protection when the iPad is not in use and allows for speedier typing when inputing information for various documents. I don't think it would be easy to use for a true typist - I use the old "hunt and peck" method so it works great for me. The iPad is held in position by a fairly strong magnetic strip and seats well even when typing with the folio sitting on my lap. There are several keyboard shortcuts specific to the iPad which makes the interface via bluetooth even easier. I am very pleased with this product.

..

6006840060008 Purchased Logitech Keyboard case for Ipad mini, she loves it. It fits good, keyboard works great with ipad and it keeps ipad secure when using keyboard or not.

..

6006840060008 Logitech makes an excellent keyboard. We love the size, the color, the feel and the functionality of this product. We highly recommend it to those looking for a keyboard and a protective case for their ipad minis.

..

6006840060008 turns your mini into a real computer. very easy to use

..

6006840060008 Works great, looks very good. Keys feel natural and comfortable. Highly recommend.

..

6006840060008 I have the iPad mini and this item protects the mini and works just like a keyboard should.

..

6006840060008 Love the ability to type like a computer. I just could not get the hang of typing efficiently on the iPad mini, as much as I love it.

..

6006840060008 I really like the iPad mini since it is easy to hold in one hand. I had another case (without the keyboard) and it wouldn't stand very well. This one is magnetic and stands well.

..

..

6006840060008 The keyboard is comfortable to use and the keys respond quickly to touch

..

6006840060008 This keyboard is great. I love the wave design. It really fits my hands great. I also like the detail of the where the base of my palms rest. It gives it a grip without being rough.

..

6006840060008 I like this keyboard a lot. Very comfortable to use for extended hours.

..

6006840060008 Quality Keyboard, offering many convenient shortcuts

..

6006840060008 The keyboard an mouse are easy to install. This keyboard allows you to be able to launch any program in Microsoft Office with ease.

..

6006840060008 bought for new computer, no wires, great price, does what it should.

..

6006840060008 As a programmer I type a lot and having a full sized ergonomic keyboard is important. The wave style layout is a little different from the natural keyboard i was used to, but it really does feel more natural. Give it a try.

..

6006840060008 Love it it works perfectly...... what more is there to say

..

6006840060008 this is a great keyboard for use when spending most of the day at the keyboard. comfort, speed as well as price are high on the list

..

6006840060008 Great Keyboard and Mouse this is my second one I had to Buy. The dropped the first one and the keys broke and one leg broke. So I came back to Best Buy and got another one. It was out of warranty. I didn't care I just like the Mouse and the Keyboard both are wireless and easy to reconnect .

Speed through documents and Web pages easily with this Logitech Marathon Wireless Mouse M705 910-001229, which features a scrolling wheel for fast navigation and a battery indicator light that lets you know when the batteries need to be changed.


..

6006840060008 I'm on my computer everyday for business & personal and this product makes moving thru my screens a snap. This is my first time owning a wireless mouse so I went out an d bought the wireless keyboard to go with it. I must say not being tethered to a CPU is great, I sometimes just relax back in my chair and surf the web, order products, write letters or bring up movies and conduct my business without the hassle of having to be in one place. Thank You Logitech

..

6006840060008 Would buy another one but probably wait for a sale. Easy to set up and program

..

6006840060008 My old mouse died and I wanted something to replace it. This is perfect! It's the right size and fit for my hand. It was a great find!

..

6006840060008 Works great with my Mac air. It was easy to sync to the computer also

..

6006840060008 While I think the mouse is excellent for general use or slower motion, I found it to be a bit too large for fast-paced first person shooters.

..

6006840060008 I purchased the best Logitech Mouse as a gift for a family member. I already own a Logitech Mouse and am very happy with the product.

..

6006840060008 I purchased this mouse to replace a Microsoft wireless mouse that had become erratic and unpredictable. This Logitech mouse has a much better, i.e., a more natural and comfortable, feel than my previous one. The controls are convenient yet not placed so that you will be triggering them by accident. Lightweight and nimble, this mouse has a useful and very easy to use feature that enables very fast scrolling. It did take me a while to adjust to the sensitivity and lighter touch compared to my previous mouse, but it has definitely been an improvement for me.

..

6006840060008 This is an excellent mouse for those who need something comfortable, easy to use, and smooth on all surfaces. the price is a little high, but worth every penny.

..

6006840060008 Great Mouse, really sensible and easy to use. It was really easy to install.

..

6006840060008 This mouse fits my hand very well and allows me to use it all day long at work comfortably. The scroll wheel is great for long web pages or excel documents. I love the buttons on this mouse, too. They're really useful. If you find its a bit fatiguing to use, try removing one of the two batteries for more comfort (it will work fine with just one battery).

..

Gaming Mouse G400 delivers rock-solid performance for when your sights are set on victory. A 3600 dpi optical sensor provides precision targeting and pinpoint accuracy, while in-game dpi switching lets you change the mouse's tracking characteristics to match the situation. Go from pixel-precise targeting (400 dpi) to lightning-fast maneuvers (up to 3600 dpi) without ever having to interrupt play. Full-speed USB communicates with the PC up to 1000 times per second for a nearly instantaneous response and super-smooth movement in games. Physical mouse movements translate to the same amount of cursor movement regardless of speed, and you get consistent tracking at any hand speed. Sculpted comfort grip, low-friction feet and eight programmable buttons keep you comfortable and in command. Optical gaming mouse requires a USB port, a Windows-based PC and is compatible with Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7.


..

6006840060008 the mouseis great, the weight can be customized. The speed is very stable so you won't lose feel hard to control your pointer. It never lose frame.
Great with playing LOL and shooting games. In LOL, all the keys can be configured in the game.
Due to the big size, I don't recommend it for RTS gamers. My APM is 260+ and I prefer a smaller mouse such as G1 G100 or G100s for easier play multi-threads.
Some player may be not satisfied with the right edge of the mouse, might feel inconvinient with the 4th finger, that may need time to get use to it, or G500 may be a good choice for you.

..

6006840060008 Great mouse, no really fault for the price I got it for. Does what its suppose to. I have somewhat of a big hand and it feels very comfortable in my hands when playing games.

..

6006840060008 I had the old model (MX518) and loved it. I used it for several years until the feet wore off of the bottom. Purchased this as a replacement and it is just as awesome.
Get it.

..

6006840060008 It is good for a first person shooter games and I like how you can ajust the dpi right from the mouse.

..

6006840060008 bought for use with a PS3 eagle eye controller. works flawlessly.

..

6006840060008 I'm a geek. Love being one. Asked my buddy which mouse I should upgrade to - (was using an extremely archaic roller-ball mouse from Dell.) Built a new computer a few years ago, so figured I should probably get a new mouse too...? LOL. Normal price for this mouse was $39.99 at the time of purchase - on sale for $27.99! "Great gaming mouse, without the high price" is the idea I got about it. Purchased at $27.99 and found out that a week later it was either discontinued or further on sale - ultimately, it cost $19.99 and BestBuy credited the difference back to my account (and i didn't even have to ask or inquire! Thanks so much BB!) I haven't been into the settings to change the dpi or anything (mainly because I haven't felt the need to) but the mouse itself feels amazing. Glides flawlessly with no resistance. Not glitchy or bulky - just all around a perfect buy! I AM glad that it was only $20, but knowing what I know about it now... $40 was not a bad asking price either. I recommend this for anyone that dabbles in games and isn't looking to drop $100 on a "name brand" gaming mouse. Happy hunting to all!

..

6006840060008 The G400 fits your hand well and has programable buttons to a point , it lacks the heft of the G500 and is missing two buttons, but I am pleased with my purchase! This is a great mouse for anyone who is fed up with the mediocre mouse your computer came with and want a responsive comfortable step above the mundane. Hey you can't beat $20.00 for a good mouse!

..

6006840060008 Great mouse for the price I got it for on sale at BB.

..

6006840060008 Needed a new mouse for my gaming pc. The G400 is highly rated and for good reason. While there are many excellent wireless mice, I still prefer wired -- no recharging, no dealing with batteries. I often feel that wired mice simply last longer. Best Buy's price beat out other online retailers, so it was a no-brainer for me.

..

6006840060008 This is the replacement for the mx-518. Both great mice! If you can still find either, buy them! I've always had great luck with Logitech mice and you can't go wrong with the G400. The comfort, durability, and logevity of these mice can't be beat!

..

6006840060008 
With the Logitech S315i multimedia speaker you'll never miss a beat. It plays a full day's (or night's) worth of music on a single charge. It's easy to take with you, and lets you enjoy every note as it was meant to be heard.


..

6006840060008 Returned this iphone speaker for the next model up S715i. The sound was just fair with not much bass. The larger model S715i has much better sound and great bass.

..

6006840060008 Best feature of this is the portability. Easy to unlug and shove in your backpack. Recharges your ipod / iphone while you listen, so long as it's plugged in. Good for a few hours of music on battery!
Sound quality isn't bad. I use it as my regular speakers for my laptop since it has a 3.5mm jack as well. Have used it a few times for parties on battery, everyone loved it. Can't control songs remotely or from speaker, but hey you can just use youre ipod for that right? You can control volume, though.
***If you're going to be docking / undocking your ipod a lot, I would not recommend this item. Especially if your ipod has a case. It takes a few tries to dock and people who aren't familiar with how to do it might just give up. That's when you take over and dock it. =)

..

6006840060008 I wanted a portable speaker system to carry on my boat that would allow me to listen to Pandora and other internet radio via my Blackberry. I am very happy with the quality of the unit and although the sound cannot compare to a Bose speaker, it performs very well.

..

6006840060008 I'm a dancer so I love being able to take my speakers anywhere I go if I need to practice, etc. And they're loud, too :)

..

6006840060008 Wish it played louder, sound is not as good as I expected.

..

6006840060008 Was truly amazed at sound quality . Listen to a lot of internet radio . i have a droid X which i use an auxiliary plug that u plug in the back . Wish it was on the side or on top side of the unit. the rechargable batteries last for about eight hours at reasonable volume levels.

..

6006840060008 This docking station is poor quality for the price. This is my second Logitech Ipod docking station I've had. The other one I had was terrific and lasted a couple years. It still would turn on and off, but no sound came out of the player. I purchased this docking station as I couldn't find the same one I had before and I liked it for the rechargeable battery feature. After two months it stopped working. Same deal....would turn on and off, but no sound comes out of the player. Unfortunately, I didn't save the warranty info. I won't purchase another Logitech player.

..

6006840060008 I bought this as a gift for my wife for her new MP3 player. Play back sounded as if an echo was coming out of the MP3 player. Listen through the ear plugs and great sound. I went through the MP3 player set up. No luck, still had the echo sound. Plus one track was louder then the other track. Voice track was low and in the back ground, where the backup singers and music where a lot louder and over ran the singer. For the price it's not worthe the money. May work a lot better if we owned a ipod? An ipod is out of our range price wise.

..

6006840060008 This unit is nearly perfect for its intended purpose. I originally got this to replace an ungainly collection of powered speakers and iPod chargers with what seemed like dozens of cables and plugs that kept getting tangled up. The Logitech unit has one single wire for the AC adapter, everything else is self-contained - very neat and orderly and nice-looking. The sound quality is amazingly good for such a compact unit. Sure, you can get better sound quality from a larger set of speakers, but this is the best sound I've heard from something this portable. As a bonus, since it is actually battery powered, you can just pick it up and carry it from room to room - and so I was able to get rid of all the extra sets of powered speakers throughout the house. The battery life seems quite long, certainly long enough for my purposes. The smooth rounded shape when closed makes it very easy to carry when traveling - no awkward corners to deal with. I've been using it with an iPod Touch, an 3rd gen Nano, and a 2nd gen original iPod - it works perfectly for charging and playing all of them. Works great with the iPod Touch as a Pandora receiver. The only change in this product that I would suggest is that it would be nice if it could share battery power with the iPod when not connected to the AC - right now my portability time is limited by the iPod touch draining relatively quickly when receiving Pandora via WiFi.

..

6006840060008 Is expensive and the sound is very bad, very different from what is said in the promotion article. I am very disappointed with the purchase.

..

6006840060008 
Play music on the go with this Logitech UE wireless speaker that features 2 full-range drivers that deliver pure and rich sound. A built-in microphone lets you make hands-free phone calls using a Bluetooth-enabled device.


..

6006840060008 I bought the Logitech UE Boombox for $129 + tax, loved the sound especially the bass but it's big and heavy. I didn't want to return it but I really dislike the size and the color as well as the battery life(4.5 hrs) at full blast. Also, I had an issue controlling the volume from my device(Nexus 5) . I was not able to raise or lower the volume from my phone. So I decided to try the Logitech UE Mobile Boombox. I paid $59 tax included, Officemax had it for 54.99 so BB matched their price. I was concerned my nexus 5 wouldn't pair properly but it did. I, also paired it to my Nexus 7 2013. Sound is clear and loud, although I missed the bass from the larger boombox. Battery life has not been measured but most reviews say it's about 8-10 hrs, which is more than enough for me. I hope my review helps you in your decision.

..

6006840060008 I have a Bose Sounlink II, and was looking for something smaller for packing and traveling. Picked this up and have no regrets. While the Bose is premier I was thoroughly impressed with the sound quality to price ratio. You will not be disappointed

..

6006840060008 The Logitech - UE Mobile Boombox is a very nice bluetooth speaker. Extremely easy to set up and sounds incredible. Very sturdy and looks great. Couldn't be happier with my purchase!

..

6006840060008 I bought this speaker for my g/f and it's awesome! The sound quality actually surprised me - don't get me wrong - it's not a Bose. It has a full rich sound out that comes from a very cool, small, easy-to-use speaker that is 1/3 of the price of a Bose. I'm very happy with my purchase, my g/f loves the speaker and I'm completely impressed with this product. Great job Logitech!!

..

6006840060008 I spent some time before making a choice reading reviews. I had made a lot of decisions in which speakers I was really interested. Turned on the ones I was picking from. The prices ranged from 79-250 dollars. This little unit stood proud and belted out the music. It was not the loudest, but it was the clearest! The surprising thing is it will fill a bedroom/bathroom with great sound. It also works perfect for a speakerphone in loud areas.
It is built well, looks great, deep sound and it comes with Logitech customer support behind it. Gotta say, I am looking forward to having it along with me this summer kayaking.

..

6006840060008 It is great! As small as it is, it has great sound -Its very loud! And also you dont need any cables to connect because it has bluetooth! Wow! Excellent!

..

6006840060008 Awesome product with great sound, easy set up, and long battery life

..

6006840060008 I never write reviews for anything, but I felt obligated to write one about the speaker. I was skeptical at first to purchase it because of how small the product was to be so costly. I was clearly wrong. I purchased the speaker already planning to take it back because I didn't think I would like it as much as I did. It was a great buy for me. As much as I listen to music this product really WOWed me. I fell in love as soon as I used it the same day. I haven't really timed the battery life, but it does last for quite some time. If you or anyone you know listen to music as frequently as I do, this is definitely an item to buy.

..

6006840060008 The Ue Logitech Mobile Boombox is a great gift for someone! It is portable, has a fantastic sound system, easy to transport, and comes in varieties of colors! It is small so it doesn't take up any of your space! I HIGHLY recommend this product!

..

6006840060008 My mom has been hankering for some portable speakers for her new iPhone and Mac Book. I went to Best Buy planning to purchase the Jambox, but these actually sound better and get much louder. I was shocked! Great purchase - and still cute.

..

6006840060008 I got this wireless mouse because my original one stopped working. It fits my hand well, and it is easy to use. The original battery is still working (the packaging said it was good for 18 months), but since I use it a lot, I didn't think it would last as long as it has so far. I'm impressed! The sticker on the display was $20 higher than it actually was so that's a plus also (the wrong sticker was displayed).

..

6006840060008 Easy to handle, Quick reaction time, easy roll on mouse pad, Only (1)
long lasting battery. Absolutely Best Mouse I have ever owned!

..

6006840060008 I like the mouse and really enjoying to use it while I am at work. I never had any issues with this. I am planning to buy the same to my wife so that she never feel jealous of my mouse. ;)

..

6006840060008 Device is easy to use. I have used other Logitech mice before and this one is one of my favorite. It is very portable and connects with all devices I have tried so far without any install on the computer I am using. Really love this device.

..

6006840060008 The Logitech mouse is your standard mouse. I just like the Logitech devices. They work well.

..

6006840060008 I have bought several wireless mouse(s). This one is a little small, however I like that the battery life is longer because it goes into sleep mode when not in use.

..

6006840060008 Bought it for the laptop. Best price. Like the color. Easy to use.

..

6006840060008 Just plug it in and in about a minute you are using it. Love how it works on multiple surfaces.

..

6006840060008 I wanted a small stylist mouse and this worked perfectly.

..

6006840060008 This is a great product at an amazing price. It was recommended by the sales person and they were right

6006840060008 The directions don't explain that you have to go into your computer system and adjust tones, the room the speakers are used in and volume to get the best sound although it's plug in and play. I ventured and found it for myself. I really loved them after that discovery.

..

6006840060008 I will be the first to admit that I am not an audiophile but I can't go a day without my music and when my Logitech Z313 speakers went out on me I searched for a replacement because I was happy with what I was getting out of them. Then I saw these on clearance for five dollars less than the Z313 speakers and thought I would give them a shot.

Setup of these speakers is easy. While I am not a fan of connections that are soldered into speakers and subwoofers, (the demise of my Z313 set was a direct result of not being able to swap out cables) the cables are heavy duty so that offsets that worry. While the cables themselves are short they are easily extendable. I would recommend getting a new line in cable as the one provided is a bit on the flimsy side but still functional. The option to wall mount your speakers is nice as well.

As far as sound quality is concerned these are great. You get great sound and bass right out of the box but if you know how to tweak an equalizer you can really milk these guys for quality sound. Add the fact that you can connect up to three other devices without unplugging anything else is awesome as well. Great for casual television viewing and gaming.

If these speakers were still 120.00 I would say pass until the price goes down as these speakers are only slightly better than the z313 model but what the z313 got wrong (unable to replace cables, volume dongle, only one line in) the z553 got right. At 45.00 you can't go wrong.

..

6006840060008 Decent price. Decent sound. I'd recommend for computer speakers.

..

6006840060008 I made my purchase as an impulse buy. I was surprised at how well its compatible with all my mobile devises and laptop.

..

6006840060008 Good sound for the price. I'm using them to augment the sound on a bedroom TV and they're excellent in that role. Certainly not something you'd use for a primary home theater setup, but for a computer or a secondary TV they are very solid.

..

6006840060008 First thing's first: My review for these speakers is very dependent upon the price I paid for them. I got these for $30 a piece (I bought two). My review still stands at the $52.99 pricetag that several online retailers are showing right now.

I love these speakers. These speakers are worth well over $50. I would say that the $99 price tag that I was seeing these at several weeks back might be a little high given the lack of THX certification found with some other Logitech speakers at that price point, but I would've been happy having paid $75 for these.

CONS:
- Aesthetics: Probably a turn-off for some, though I don't mind. What you see on the product page is what you're getting, but you are able to switch out the speakers for others with RCA inputs if you really hate the look and just need the sub/amp and maybe the control pod. Additionally, the cables are red. If I have exposed cables, I prefer that they be black. Both left and right speakers have red cables, as does the control pod. Even the included AUX cable is red. The only black cable is the power to the sub. I do like the red LED on the control pod, but mostly because it matches my case lights.
- Cable length: I could do with a few more feet of length on the speaker cables, but I managed. I suspect this length is pretty standard, I was just spoiled with my old 5.1 system that had 25 foot cables (though that system also had 40W per speaker and I was draining a fair amount of power just in cable length). You can always get standard RCA extensions, but you'll lose some volume capacity by doing so.
- Bass: Honestly, this system has all the bass I need, but I'm not an audiophile. I have an 8" sub in my car that's way more than I need, but this 4" sub does just fine for my needs. It is good enough that you'll be able to hear some (a small amount of) thump on your other floors, but don't expect the same kind of bass that makes your rearview mirror vibrate like mad or really upsets your neighbors. I end up leaving my bass control near 100% most of the time (gaming or listening to electronica). There is no independent input for the sub (like a center/sub jack you'll see with a 5.1 system).

PROS:
- Price! If you find these for the $30 I paid, jump on it! I'd still happily pay the $53 I've been seeing around.
- Sound quality: You can expect the quality of a $75-$150 set of PC speakers. I'm very happy with it. Sounds are clean and clear for the entire volume range. There is no disparity between the left and right speakers (as I've seen at least one other person mention) for either of the two sets I received.
- Build quality: I have no complaints on build quality. It feels solid and well-built. I worry a bit about the exposed speaker cones, but if you don't poke them hard they'll be fine, plus they look kind of neat. The speakers hold their angle very well when adjusted.
- Control pod: I adore this thing. It's has good rubber on the bottom to keep it from sliding and it's made to be heavy to hold itself in place. The entire top cylinder (visible in the product images) is the volume control and slides very smoothly and pleasantly. In the rear of the control are a headphone jack, an AUX input, and a bass control. The headphone jack (no duh) automatically disables sound to the speakers when used. The bass control (which I love, considering my old unit required me to crawl under my desk to adjust the bass) is a simple wheel that you can feel your way to without needing to look behind the unit. I lovethat there's an AUX input on the control pod because my spouse will often sit with her laptop nearby and want the better speakers without having to use my desktop. The AUX input can be left plugged in and does not disable any other inputs, they just overlap if you have more than one audio source. Finally, I really like that the control pod cable isn't integrated with one of the speaker cables (like many systems like this, particularly Logitech), which allows you to switch to any RCA-cabled speakers if you so choose.
- 3x Inputs: The system has three inputs, one AUX in the control pod (as mentioned previous), one AUX in the subwoofer, and one red/white RCA input in the subwoofer. I really like having several options so that I can have my computer in the AUX, a cable box in the RCA, and a phone for podcasts or a nearby computer in the control pod AUX. I've tested them all and they work as expected.
- Subwoofer design: I really like the vertical down-firing sub, though others may not. The casing is all plastic and the build quality is good. I like that I can fit it in a tight footprint, but it may not work for your setup. From the bottom of the rubber foot to the top of the sub, it's just under 15". If you include the diameter of the feet, you'll need just over 7" across for your footprint.
- Vertical angle adjustable: It's convenient and allows for wall-mounting, although you can't pass 90 horizontal (aim upward) if you chose to wall-mount. The angle holds well.
- Wall-mountable: It's nice that the system has this capability (thus it being listed as a "pro"), but if this is what you're buying for, it's not exactly going to be a simple procedure. There wasn't any sort of hardware or instructions included for wall-mounting, but the rubber feet are removable and provide a hole through which a screw or nail could pass, though I don't see you getting the flawless flush mount the product pictures show since you'll likely have the head of a screw exposed. I'd recommend only actually screwing in the top hole that's hidden by the speaker, then maybe leaving the other two holes empty or fashioning your own black plugs. (Note: I did not wall-mount my speakers)

In summary, these things are great! They aren't for you if you need a huge kick from your bass or you hate seeing the color red. There were enough negative reviews on some sites that I felt compelled to actually right a written review, so that's saying something considering I only provide written reviews when I feel strongly about a product (maybe once every year or two?).

6006840060008 Nicely packaged.
Fairly easy to set up. But did not have any sound from left speaker.

..

6006840060008 I bought these on clearance for $50. They're great speakers for $50 and are much better than the other logitec offerings at this price point, better than their $50 and $65 speakers. I wouldn't want to pay more for them... at $50 it's good sound for the value. More than that and value drops off sharply. For a bit more you can do inexpensive bookshelf speakers and a t-class amplifier for great sound at a low price, but these look real fun and take up less desk space than the bookshelf units. Anyway... so the first pair I got in there was a spot on the volume at around 50% that made the left channel fade out, pop and hiss. I had read about this in a review before so I wasn't really surprised. Disappointed but not surprised. I was happy enough with the build quality and sound from the speakers so I quickly returned them locally and had them send me another set. This second set sounds great and is without fault. I was skeptical of the little 4" woofer but it does really well. I've mine in the corner about 6" from either wall. I'm not going to say anything like "dazzling highs and hard hitting base" but I'll say they sound great, better than most computer speakers I've checked out. especially at $50. We'll see how long they last but if I get a couple of years out of them I'll be a happy camper. I'd say they're just right for a small living room or bedroom sized area for mp3 player sound or tv audio. They're perfect for your desk.

..

6006840060008 These speakers have no volume. They may be very smooth, but have nothing else. Beware of the RMS rating. It's not real.

..

6006840060008 just got this baby from best buy when its on a clearance sales for 80, works like a charm so far since.
the 40 watts subwoofer delivers nice packs of bass(though it wasnt really good, it can do better), average high and medium on each 10 watts speakers. love that it allows you to adjust the bass to your liking though it was placed at an awkward position, at the back of the volume control. love the design, solid black speakers and subwoofer with red cables definitely spice things up in the room. also love it cuz it allows you to connect to 3 devices simultaneously.
could be a bit pricey, tagged at 120 as the original price, other speakers at this price range could do better. but, got mine on the clearance sale for 70 which was a steal.
easy installation is also a plus, just plug-and-play.
rockin the house ever since!

The bag is small, portable, and comfortable to use. And you can easily stow it under the seat on a plane. This bag is perfect if you want to travel light, and don't need to carry all the gears you have.

Fastpack 150 Carrying Case (Backpack) for 13" Camera


..

6006840060008 Nice bag but after I got all my accessories it is no longer big enough so I had to go out and buy another bag - but I will use this bag for my previous camera

..

6006840060008 Overall a great small bag for you camera, although it may ba just a little too small.
A 13" MacBook Pro just fits inside, but only just.
By adjusting the dividing pieces inside I was able to fit my camera with a 18-200 zoom attached, a flash, and a 35 mm prime inside... But only just!
I wish Lowepro would make a Video Fastpack 200, as this (150) is slightly too small, but the 250 version is too big for my needs..

..

6006840060008 
Protect your camera with this backpack that is designed for use with most DSLR cameras. Polyester, ripstock and nylon materials provide durability for optimal protection.


..

6006840060008 I have enjoyed this camera bag! It keeps me organized and has also been great during travel.

..

6006840060008 Well made bag carries my D300 Nikon (larger DSLR camera) with short zoom, long zoom, and separate flash attachment. Great padding for protection. Also extra compartments for stashing a lunch or light jacket. This is a comfortable backpack type bag. Interestingly, it also has a compartment fora laptop computer, so the bag works well for trips where I bring camera and computer on air travel. Highly recommend.
Downside is ease of access to camera. This is not a speedy, grab you camera and shoot type of bag. I own a different bag for those types of occasions.

Head out on a vacation adventure carrying your digital SLR camera in this camera backpack that accommodates 1 camera with an 80-200mm f/2.8 lens plus 1-3 additional lenses or other digital accessories.


..

6006840060008 Bought this camera bag for my wife's birthday. She is using it for her Canon DSLR. All of her equipment fits well, and it's very secure since it accesses from the back panel only. It's also very compact in size compared to other bags, making it comfortable to wear. Nicely constructed bag that is well worth the money.

..

6006840060008 Bought this bag few weeks ago and thought it will be great for an amateur camera enthusiast like me. I have 3 lenses and a speedlite all of them fits in this bag. I like that it opens from the back so I always feel secure. This bag is great if you like the outdoors.

..

6006840060008 This is a great product for the price, I absolutely love it.

..

6006840060008 I got this bag specifically for my travel overseas for hiking. The bag was a great fit for my camera and my extra lens, it was comfortable durable and practical!

..

6006840060008 I have 100-400mm and 70-200mm L series lenses and it was a very tight fit. Had to return this to get the flipside 300 instead. The bag is fine if you regular size lenses.

..

6006840060008 I've been looking for a camera bag for a while, but couldn't convince myself the typical looking camera man bag designs. This flipside 200 actually has a very cool design, and you open the backpack by unzipping in the inner side. The compartments inside are modular and very spacey. I'm currently carrying a t2i w/ battery grip w/ 2 batteries, 2 extra batteries, charger, 50mm 1.4, kit lens, lens cleaning brush, memory cards, flash, and a lot more. It will carry the medium to light tripods, and it's been highly constructed. It's got loops on the straps for pens, clip ons, pocket knife, etc. It also has two backpack straps for the chest and the waist. I'm in love with this bag!

6006840060008 Product was a gift for my daughter-in-law who has a new camera and wanted a way to carry her camera and accessories while hiking, etc. She liked the many compartments and that the zipper to access them was toward the back and not exposed to anyone behind her.

Organize your photography essentials with this Lowepro Flipside 500 AW LP36412 camera bag that features a back-entry compartment to keep your gear accessible and secure on the go. The zippered front pocket offers space for a tablet.


..

6006840060008 The Flipside is a much needed expansion from my small Mini Trekker. I would recommend Lowepro carefully demonstrate how access to the backpack should be taken with care on-the-fly. The contents, if not careful, could be dumped out without a little leg support from below. All is good though, plenty of needed space for equipment. I'm excited to put it to use!

..

6006840060008 This is my third Lowepro flipside bag. I started with the smallest in the 300 and then got two of the 400s and then finally this one. This bag can store 2 dslrs easily and at least 6-8 lenses. It will be great for long trips where I need this kind of setup. The chains on the bag are of excellent quality. The material of the bag is undestructable. I have always loved lowepro's quality and this bag did not disappoint. Got it at an unbeatable price. Great value thru Best Buy!

..

6006840060008

..

6006840060008 Since the Lowepro Flipside 10L Backpack was so new, I wasn't able to find much as far as reviews on the net before deciding to purchase it. But when Best Buy had a great deal on it, I couldn't resist. Especially for $50 less then the retail price. The only problem I had was that I wasn't able to check one out in person to help me decide if I wanted to get the 10L or 15L. And then of course, I couldn't decide on the colors available..... blue or orange. But, I decided to go with the Orange 10L because since I am a female, I wanted a backpack that wouldn't be too bulky for me. And the most important thing for me was that the shoulder straps were not too wide where it would bite into my arm. Since I couldn't actually check one out in person, I knew that I was taking a risk in purchasing it but I figured, what the heck.... for the price and since it's from Best Buy, I could always return it. Well, I am extremely glad that I got it. Not only is it super lightweight but it is overall, very comfortable. I was able to fit my Nikon d7000 w/ a 70-300mm, 50mm f/1.4, and SB-600 flash in the backpack with some room left to spare. Exactly what I needed the backpack for. The only thing that I wish that Lowepro had included was perhaps a bit of more organizer pockets. Other then that, I would highly recommend this backpack. This is perfect for me as I like to do a lot of street photography and a lot of walking. I have purchased numerous bags & backpacks in the last couple of months, only to continue my search for the perfect one. Thank you Best Buy & Lowepro for helping me find the "perfect" dslr backpack!

6006840060008 Thought about to buy a 10L AW instead, made a wise decision to choice the 15L AW, it has a bit more space for your gears. I can fit my 5d mk3 with 70-200 IS2 f/2.8, 24-70 f/2.8 II, 580EX2, and some filters comfortably. The backpack fits and looks extreme good. Love it.

..

6006840060008 I bought this bag because my camera case was just not cutting it anymore. I carry my Nikon D3000 with the 18-55mm lenses, a 75-300mm lenses, speed flash, GoPro HD2, mounts for GoPro, batteries, lense filters, charger for Nikon, SD cards, and my tripod when needed.

..

6006840060008 I would recommend this camera bag. it holds everything thing i needed, its durable and a good price.

..

6006840060008 There is a place for everything and all of the equipment is well protected. The bag is not bulky and the design allows for it to be carried as a back pack. This bag is being used by a serious photography student so it is important to have room for all of the lenses, cameras and extras she will be using. It also accommodates her tripod.

..

6006840060008 Received as a gift. It looks good and has plenty of storage features.

..

6006840060008 I bought this bag to house a Canon 60D with 18-135mm lens, 70-200mm lens, and 50mm lens...with room for either one more lens or flash in the future. The bag is made very durable, as can be felt from the weight alone. It is a relatively small backpack, sit rides kind of high on the back, which is good for hiking and walking around. Took it to Disneyland with my family of four. Carried the camera, lenses listed, four bottles of water, wife's wallet, and a half a gallon ziploc bag full of snacks. I thought it might be overkill as a camera bag for a dad with a camera, but it fit the bill perfectly.

..

6006840060008 I purchased this to hold my Digital SLR camera, lens and flash unit. Holds these securely and the bag provides ample padding. Compartments have infinite options with velcro adjustment. Sections to hold flash cards and cables. Quality of bag is good.

..

6006840060008 As usual Lowepro thought of most everything when designing this bag. I bought this for a trip to Hawaii to bring my multiple camera's, lenses as well as a video camera.
The size, versatility and protection of this bag was perfect, I would highly recommend checking it out before buying any other similar bag.

6006840060008 Can hold Canon 70-200 F/4 Lens with 50D Body and 2 extra lens, battery, charger, cables, filters,

..

6006840060008 This is a great bag for 1 camera and a couple of lens. Small enough so it is easy tho carry.

..

6006840060008 I like this camera case because it holds everything you need, additional lens, charger, USB cords etc...and is easily carried as a backpack. This allows you to shoot photos and change lens periodically.

Stow away or safely transport your compact system camera or DSLR camera with this Lowepro Passport Sling II LP36466 camera bag that features a nylon and polyester construction for protection against scratches and damage.


..

6006840060008 It is a good bag. But a few Velcro loops could make it a great bag. I want to carry a tripod along with my camera. This bag madness that difficult.

..

6006840060008 The bag looks like an ordinary bag which is really good since it does not shout a camera bag. However, the longer I use it the more discomfort on my shoulder. Another demerit point is the lack of cushion of the camera compartment.

..

6006840060008 Overall, the bag is the best I have seen - and I looked at quite a few, I would definitely recommend - and in fact, bought mine off of a friend's
recommendation.

Safeguard your camera and accessories in this Lowepro Transit Sling 250 AW LP36576 bag, which features dedicated pockets and an UltraFlex system for organized storage. A side zippered opening provides fast, easy camera access.


..

6006840060008 This camera bag is pretty good for traveling around my house. I just need to put all my stuff in one bag. If the designer can make backpack and sling together ( I can switch either way), that will be better. I right shoulder will feel pained by carrying sling bag for a long time.

..

6006840060008 I like the large screen compared to most MP3 players,
It takes some practice to use menus effectively.
My blue tooth connector didn't work well with it, the transmitter easily came unplugged.
I put it in a small case for protection and for carrying. That works well as long as none of the buttons are pushed.
4 gig size is adequate and it was easy to add a flash with a little manipulation to increase storage. Drag and drop between PC and player works well.

..

6006840060008 This was purchased for my 8 yr old daughter, playlists are difficult and the menus are not very user friendly. The touch screen sensitivity isn't that great either and the battery runs out quickly, like after an hr or so of use. Even in sleep mode the battery drains. For a cheap device for a child this is decent but for constant use and reliability I would opt for something better.

..

6006840060008 The mp3 player replaced a Coby that my grandchild had used and liked. I thought this player would be good for her because it had more features, a touch screen, a camera, plays video, etc. But the touchscreen doesn't work well and she gets frustrated trying to change apps and turn it on and off. It also doesn't have an FM radio which is too bad. I am not impressed with this player.

..

6006840060008 Good product, good price, and it is a nice addition to my music accessories.

..

6006840060008 It is a good starting mp3. It plays music and other things.

..

6006840060008 I like the fact i can put pictures, books movies and of course my music on it.

..

6006840060008 I loved it at first, but I don't think it lasted a month before breaking. If it had a metal case and a glass screen it would be a much better product.

..

6006840060008 got this to replace a current mp3 player for my car, and initially i was happy to have a new one. however due to the issues that I've had with the touchscreen i still find myself going back to my old mp3 player most of the time.

..

6006840060008 Can only get a little over 2.5gb of music onto a 4gb player

..

6006840060008 I bought this for my 10 year old. He loves listening to music and recording himself with the MP3 player.

..

6006840060008 it is easy to set up. it is good for a beginer like me. it has a good camera on it. it is awsome!

..

6006840060008 This mp3 is terrible. When i got it , it wouldnt turn on. Then when i let it charge some more and began to use it certain areas of the touchscreen (corners) didnt work. I even "calibrated" the touchscreen and it still didnt. Im not about to have sore thumbs because im jabbing them into my mp3 player.

..

6006840060008 I got this player for my birthday in hot pink. I love it. The menu is easy to understand and music is super easy to upload

Make up to 10 cups of freshly ground coffee from your favorite coffee beans with this Magic Chef coffeemaker that features automatic grind and brew for simplified use. The keep-warm function makes sure your coffee stays warm after it brews.


..

6006840060008 Went to go make my first pot of coffee in the new appliance, began pouring water into the reservoir. It stayed ... Like those road runner cartoons. But just as the cloud vanishes from under the coyote, so to did any visions of fresh coffee in my brain. The water poured out from everywhere - as if the seams of the entire machine were only connected by cheese cloth.

..

6006840060008 I got this machine to replace the coffee pot and grinder on my counter. It's a good price which was one of the key reasons I bought it. Programming the time to start the grind/brew is pretty straight forward, however the user manual could be more detailed as to what certain settings do or simply the process. The lights on the front of the machine are very bright, it's a night light in the kitchen, which is somewhat nice, but it is so bright that it actually makes it difficult to see the buttons and settings in certain situations. It is a pretty tall machine, so be sure to check the measurements before you buy. The grinder actually does a pretty good job of grinding evenly, however it is loud, partly because it is small. It's a small motor so it will be a little noisier. The problem with the grinder is that it simply runs too long. For the 1-4 cup setting it is set to run for 30 sec. and for a full pot it is set to run for 40 sec. This is way too long, after about 20 seconds, the beans are all ground and it's ready, this is when it gets loud, however I have figured out how to stop it and then set the program to run. When it is brewing it is actually pretty quiet and does a really good consistent job. My biggest frustration with this machine is the fact that you must clean the guts of it after every brew! Moisture builds up in the bean hopper and makes it muddy, there is a cover over the filter basket to help guide the grounds to the right spot this gets dirty. It is very annoying, so if you make more than one pot of coffee in the morning or even during the day this may not be your choice as it must be cleaned after every use. It even says to do this on the parts, so it's not just me. A couple of tricks I have done. I put beans in the hopper and "run" the cycle, stopping the grinder with the "off" button so I don't have to listen to it do nothing. I then push the "no grind" button and set the program timer. I have to do this, it is just to loud for too long in the morning, and I hate mornings enough.

Take advantage of the hobby-grade features of this Maisto 81132 remote-controlled Baja Beast off-road vehicle that propel you into some serious off-road racing action. The coil-over shocks and off-roading tires allow you to race on a variety of terrains.


..

6006840060008 I bought this for my son based on good reviews and reasonable price. It worked very well. My son loved it. The only downfall at first was that we couldn't buy a spare battery because of the unique battery connection. My son couldn't wait for the recharges he had so much fun. Then in the second week, it broke. when you try to make it go it just clicks. What a let down.

..

6006840060008 I bought this for my son for his birthday about a month ago. We go out and play with it a couple times a week. He really loves it :) Its very fast for a toy grade RC car and it looks very cool. I bought a 2nd battery online for it because the run time between charges is only 15min so that wasnt very good. After a few crashes my son managed to break off the silver plastic front bumper. I was able to use plastic epoxy to fix it though. The antenna straw that holds the antenna up on the car is very cheap and will break pretty quickly but thats not a big deal. I bought a replacement for $2 at a local hobby shop. Overall this RC car is very fun, looks great and is fast. Not a bad purchase. I find it to be better quality than alot of toy grade RC cars so this one is pretty decent.

..

6006840060008 Very responsive, setting the alignment from the remote is nice, drives great on pavement and hard dirt. Grass and soft dirt are not so great as the car is not heavy enough to get adequate weight on the tires, but that's true for most battery powered RC cars. Overall my 6 year old son has a good time using this car so I'm happy about that.

..

6006840060008 My son loves it, tought car. Easy to use, nice controller food range.

..

6006840060008 Great RC for my 5 year old and durable.My son loves it and plays with it often.

..

6006840060008 Tie rod mechanism is plastic and breaks easily. This is the third one in our extended family that has had one break.

Capture clear photos with this Manfrotto 293 MK293C4-D3Q2 tripod and 3-way photo head that offer stable support for most cameras up to 8.8 lbs. The lightweight, collapsible design lets you fold down portions of the tripod and head for easy transport.


..

6006840060008 The design of the head handles could be improved. Not completely user friendly. Ball head is much quicker to use and easy to operate.

This fish fryer features 1650 watts of power and accommodates up to 1 gal. of oil, so you can fry several servings of fish simultaneously. The folding lid with a built-in window allows you to monitor the cooking progress.


..

6006840060008 Can cook so much faster! Love this deep fryer! Will definitely recommend this product.

..

6006840060008 I should have bought it a lot sooner and not waited so long.

..

6006840060008 
Instantly stream music, movie soundtracks, audio books, game audio, and more from your tablet or smartphone, all with far better sound quality than the tiny speakers built into your device.


..

6006840060008 Surprisingly good sound for a small speaker, simple function and great value

Take your tunes with you on the go with this Memorex MW550 wireless speaker that features Bluetooth technology to allow easy pairing with a Bluetooth-enabled device. The built-in microphone enables hands-free phone calls.


..

6006840060008 This is a great product that I use when I travel for business when I don't want to listen to music on headphones while in my hotel room. Fits into my suitcase nicely, excellent sound quality at low levels (important in hotel rooms!) and very easy to pair with my iPhone 4.

..

6006840060008 Bought two of these, one for my office and one for my home woodshop. Set up with the IPhone was easy and both worked on the first try. Sound is good, but dont expect audiophile performance. Great choice for a casual listener or for background music or talk.

..

6006840060008 This is a NICE (small bluetooth) speaker that has excellent range. The strength is very good as it goes through walls and other obstructions. Also VERY easy to use as my Toshiba laptop quickly found it and synced with it. Highly recommended for the size, price, and sound quality.

..

6006840060008 This is a great speaker! I love using the bluetooth connection from my iPhone and listening to my music. It has an automatic shut off feature if you don't use it for a while, which is nice. Great sound too!

..

6006840060008 Love this speaker. Received it as a gift to use with my iTouch in my office. Love the blue tooth WiFi feature. Small speaker, great sound would also work for home or in a dorm room.

..

6006840060008 Easy to pair. Sounds great. Works with both my Samsung tablet and my Motorola Droid. Wish I had one for every room!

..

6006840060008 I bought one on sale for work and liked it so much went and bought another one for the house. Works great with my Samsung phone and sounds really good for the money. Kinda agree on if not on sale I wouldn't have bought. Would have spent a little more to get a Logitech.

..

6006840060008 I got the speaker on sale otherwise probably would not spend that much money on one. Love the size- about the same as a hardcover novel. I've never used bluetooth before- the directions were not very clear on how to get things connected but managed to figure it out.

Capture important moments on the go with this MetroPCS LG Optimus L9 610214632647-R cell phone that features a 5.0MP digital camera, so you can shoot crisp images and 1080p videos. Wi-Fi connectivity lets you surf the Web.


..

6006840060008 Got on CLOSEOUT for a teenage. Only $79 NO contract. Activated on Metro PC and works great!
NEW version (L90) has 4.7 and larger battery for just $179

..

6006840060008 Good picture quality on rear camera, but terrible for front facing camera. Phone too big for my taste. The battery gets hot with barely any use. My biggest issue is the low internal memory capacity. I'm always getting the "can't update/download/ etc...no storage space." There is no option to transfer applications to the sd card to make room on the phone. Good value for the money though.

..

6006840060008 Really love this phone very user friendly, bought one for my fiance she loves it as well just a overall great phone .

..

6006840060008 This phone has a great display and has many features.

..

6006840060008 This phone is much bigger than my other LG Motion, which I had before, and it's also way lighter. The screen is big enough for games but its pretty much useless because if you're the type that likes apps, good luck downloading them. A lot of times i find myself having to delete a ton of stuff so i can just download an app, or take a video.

..

6006840060008 I got this phone for my son and he loves it! Great for him to listen to music and play games on.

..

6006840060008 this phone has the ability for a 32 gig storage card well your apps that usually do save to sd cards DO NOT SAVE HERE

..

6006840060008 Why pay more when this phone does it all it's a great phone at a great price why pay more when this phone does it all like other expensive phone's be smart and get this phone

..

6006840060008 I enjoy using this phone. It has been very easy for me to use ut and im able to do it myself but more storage space would be nice and a better battery life would be much better.

..

6006840060008 This was a great alternative for my wife. Great price, love the Android OS, and works really well. We've had some minor call issue (delays, bad signals), but nothing really major.

Touch Cover for Surface


..

6006840060008 Microsoft did a wonderful job. Works great and keys are extremely responsive.

..

6006840060008 Works great. Easy to use and helps protect my Surface.

..

6006840060008 This product is great but some keys need a little bit more than a tap. Maybe after a while I will develop the muscle memory for the touchcover. Other then that it works well.

..

6006840060008 Slim,lightweight,and works exactly like it should. Cool shade of red that looks good when put together with the black tablet.

..

6006840060008 The touch cover is working quite well most of the time. But I had 2 instances in this first month where the keys stopped responding. I had to detach and reattach the cover to start working again. It seems fairly rugged but I am a little concerned that the very thin outer edges may become easily frayed after much use. Time will tell.

..

6006840060008 Works like a traditional push key keyboards in that I could rest my fingers on the board and type by applying pressure. Might need a little getting used to due to feel, But I got used to it really quickly.

..

6006840060008 I got this keyboard for my Windows RT tablet, I bought it separately because I didn't want just the standard black. It is a very good keyboard, better then keyboards I have used for other tablets. It does take a little bit to get used to the touch buttons, but other then that it is great!

..

6006840060008 Well it's light and cool looking, but I personally like to have a keyboard that you actually depress the keys. Traded this back in to get the more expensive snap in keyboard. It just works better I think for someone that likes to actually feel the keyboard. I may just be old fashion.

..

6006840060008 I got scared after I bought this and then saw the reviews online, however this keyboard is fantastic. It snaps on so easily. You get audio feedback when you type which lets you know the key was pressed. I am a fast typist and got used to typing on this very quickly. It makes the whole surface experience. I use it to type notes during meetings and it is brilliant.

..

6006840060008 I definitely recommend buying a touch cover with your Surface RT (or Pro), it turns the surface into a fully functional and totally portable laptop with the super responsive touchpad doubling as a screen protector when not in use. It is durable yet slim and very easy to attach (and stays attached!). Since it is a flat surface with no "give" to the keys, expert typists may need a few hours to adjust to the new feel in order to get full use of the keyboard as they would with a traditional button based keyboard. I find it getting dusty quickly but it cleans easy with a damp towel. After getting it my only regret is not getting the blue one... the red just isn't the color I wanted it to be. Other than that it is perfect :)

..

6006840060008 The upgrade from express to the full version of Pro Tools 10 has been my best software purchase of the year.
For those who are new to the program, there is a learning curve, but any effort will yield you benefits that are worth your time.

Enjoy high-definition entertainment with this Monster 1000HD Ultimate High Speed 6.6' HDMI cable that features 17.8 Gbps bandwidth to support images up to 4K x 2K resolution and 7.1 lossless surround sound.


..

6006840060008 This cable gives me a great picture. I have a 3d tv and there really is a difference between higher quality and even a mid range cable

..

6006840060008 I always love Monster products and the quality is very good. This cord is still a little high, but will come down with time.

..

6006840060008 When I checked out to purchase my Smart TV, it was recommended that I purchase this expensive cable by necessity for viewing the special features of the TV. My research after the purchase revealed that for the average user, this cable is unnecessary as the average user/viewer wouldn't be able to "capture" the benefit. I'm sure it's a great product for the right user, but not the casual.

..

6006840060008 I bought 2 of these cables, and they are the Monster Advanced which it is written on cable Advanced, not the Monster Ultimate as advertised. The cable they sent was, black with red dot, it is not the Monster Ultimate that is gray with gold dot as pictured, can't get them to respond to email, not even Best Buy can get them to respond, I'm out my purchase price stuck with inferior cables, do not use this company, they are a nightmare.

Enjoy high-definition entertainment with this Monster 1250HD Ultimate High Speed 140647-00 5' HDMI cable that features 17.8 Gbps speed for fast signal transfer. The HDMI performance indicators show you the signal resolution at a glance.


..

6006840060008 top quality hdmi cable, easy installation, purchased on sale at a good price

..

6006840060008 Works just as good as the more expensive ones, I don't think there's any need to pay more. I know the Specs say otherwise but the proof is in the pudding my friend decided to go the higher route and I got this one and we have the EXACT same TV and played the EXACT same game and it looked EXACTLY the same, I also purchased one for my Cable connection and the Image was flawless, great price and image.

..

6006840060008 The Monster 1250 is a good hdmi cable, but has contruction similar to a lower price cable. Twisted cooper wires and sodered connectors. The gimmick of this cable, is that a little light will come on to show that a 1080, 4K or 480 signal is going through. LOL

Enjoy high-quality sound with this Monster Clarity HD 133257-00 Bluetooth speaker that features AAC and apt-X support for easy pairing with your mobile phone or laptop. The built-in microphone enables speakerphone capability for conference calls.


..

6006840060008 I love this speaker. I had a Bose systemlink in my hand but thought it was to big for the place I had to put it on my motorcycle. So the sales specialist at Best Buy gave me some options. The monster clarity HD was one of these. I was concerned about the sound quality, so she set up a Bose on one side of the store and we listened to it, then she set up the Monster on the other side of the store and if I didn't know which was which I would never been able to tell the difference! My only disappointment is that the volume does not go high enough to hear on my motorcycle at highway speeds.
Other than that I highly recommend this unit.

..

6006840060008 I travel a lot for work, so this speaker has been AMAZING for me. I love the sound quality on my conference calls, and I even use it in the car for GPS and hands free calling.
I love that I can switch between my calls and music with just a touch of a button.
Music sounds great over it too, especially considering how small the speaker is. I wasn't too sure about it when I first played with it in the store, but when you aren't in a cavernous space, the speaker really fills the room well.
FANTASTIC!!!!

..

6006840060008 Ive tried the Jambox and the Bose portable But the Monster Micro was the best over all!! Back in the days Monster was known for the wires but now the gave us a portable speaker. Its great to conference calls and awesome hooked up to my iPad. I recommend all apple users to transfer your iTunes song to a AAC file and listen to how clear and strong the sound is over Bluetooth in AAC. Monster has done it again. Not sure why theres so much negitvity on here maybe everyone isnt using it correctly.
FYI - in case you need to reset the unit turn it off and the put a paper clip in the reset hole and hold it and turn the unit back on ..... simple!

..

6006840060008 I figured I would try the product due to it's compact size and being a product from Monster. The price point was very high for the disappointing quality. It constaly losses connection with my iPad 3. Resets were very troublesome. I returned it for the Bose Soundlink, Bose has it all on this device.

..

6006840060008 you cant play the music while its charging and you have always to reset it to function again ..and always disconnected from bluetooh ..jambox is much better than this one honestly ..and the durability is not good bec the grille is only magnetic if you accidentally drop it im sure it will be broken ..the sound quality is good but lack of bass ...the design i would say its good also bec of the strap and the price its not woth it 100 $ is alright of this product ..but i will not recommend this ..i hope it will for you guys ...

..

6006840060008 I bought this with the intention of using it on a day to day basis and that is exactly what I do. It works excellently in my condo and the voice activated features work extremely well! My favorite part of this unit though is the battery life! I can typically charge this the night before and take it out with me all day and never have to worry about charging it throughout the day. It sounds great for what you get and I certainly think it is much better than the jambox. Totally pick this thing up! It's awesome!

..

6006840060008 So, I purchased this NEW version of the Monster Micro HD from a Best Buy in Nasuha. I honestly think that they had the only unit on the east coast. "Cassie" at Best Buy was terrifically helpful (Good luck on your film-making degree).
There was no way to demo the unit in the store, so I bought it along with a Big Jambox for comparison. I tested this unit first when I got home and was immediately surprised by the tinny sound. It was as if the treble was set too high on the unit. Tried many genres of music and heard the same thing. So then I tried the Big Jambox. Oh my goodness!
Of course, it is in a completely different class of speaker than the Micro HD, so I know that it is unfair to compare, but c'mon kids. The extra $100 is well worth it! If you are already spending $200, why not an extra $100 to get something that is SUBSTANTIALLY better sounding. True, the Big Jambox is big compared to the Micro HD, but it is still portable. Consider what we all mean by portable here. Portable means that you can take it with you and it doesn't require two people to carry it. If you want tiny so that it fits in your pocket, then you should simply get a y-splitter and a second set of headphones if you want to share your music with others.
To my mind, the micro HD and its related brethren fall into a zone that cannot be covered with a mini speaker. They are not loud enough to fill a room with quality sound and yet they are not small enough to be better than a good set of headphones. It reminds me of the era of the crossover bicycle from the 90s. If you can afford to have a road bike and a mountain bike, then they are a MUCH better option than a crossover bicycle which is so-so on the road and lousy off road. If you are already investing $200 in a speaker, then money is probably not a real issue. So, get the Big Jambox. That extra $100 spread out over the 5 years you will be using this unit is 5 cents per day!
So, the Micro HD is a nice try, but still falls far short of the big guns: The Big Jambox and The Bose Soundlink.

Monster Cable iCarCharger AI 1000 Auto Adapter


..

6006840060008 I did check the reviews out before purchasing, but thought overall the product would be good for the drive to and from work. This item did work all done for one day only. After the second day it caused the iPhone 4 and 3Gs to reset themselves. I tried another outlet and also another car thinking it might be something to do with that. No luck. Unless this item is fixed by the manufacturer that I will be not use and cut my losses.

..

6006840060008 Horrible distortion with the use of an iPhone 4. I would test on other earlier models, but I don't feel like beta testing what should never have made out to production.

..

6006840060008 The charger works great with my iPhone 3GS, but not with my boyfriend's iPhone 4, which is why I bought it. It will charge for about 10 minutes or so, then say it's not compatible with the device. Not sure if it's a software problem or what, but does not work well with iPhone 4.

..

6006840060008 Tried 2 different units on multiple IPod/IPhones, after the unit is charging/working for a few minutes it just diconnects while still plugged in. The power light starts flashing slightly. SOmething internally like heat related.

..

6006840060008 I bought this product after absolutely loving the amazing sound quality of the Monster iCable. I figured with this product I could eliminate another cable, have the same outstanding sound quality, and have controls for my ipod at my finger tips. I could not have been more wrong. When plugging the audio cable into the aux port of my car stereo, I was shocked at the awful sound quality coming thru the speakes. I promptly returned this product(hoping that I had just gotten a defective one)but no luck. The second iCarCharger 1000's sound quality was just as distorted, and brash as the first. I returned the iCarCharger 1000 again, and went back to using my iCable with a seperate iPod car charger. All of my numerous other Monster products have always lived up to my expectations(if not exceeded them)but this product is a straight up disappointment :(

..

6006840060008 Definetly not worth the price, let alone even $20. Dont recommend this what so ever.

..

6006840060008 Add me to the list of people disappointed in the sound quality of this charger. I use my iPhone 3GS in my car for music, connecting it to my car's audio system using the AUX jack (and prior to the 3GS, used my original iPhone). I'm still using the old Belkin Auto Charger for iPod with Dock Connector which has EXCELLENT audio (no distortion whatsoever, no scratchy sound). The Belkin charger worked fine with my original iPhone, but won't charge my current 3GS. For months now I have been trying to find a replacement for the Belkin charger that will still have excellent audio, but will also charge my 3GS. So far, nothing has worked out, because the audio is always terrible.
Prior to the recent purchase of the Monster iCarCharger, I read numerous negative reviews of this product, but decided to try it anyway. The sound is fine until a loud passage in the music, and then the music is greatly distorted. Prior to the Monster iCarCharger, I also tried the Kensington LiquidAUX for iPhone/iPod, and that was even worse. The Monster iCarCharger will be going back, same as the Kensington did.
Sadly, there is not a single one of these type of products made currently (i.e., with 1 cable going to the dock connector to handle charging & audio) that has excellent audio, therefore I'll have to continue using the Belkin until someone figures out a better product. I just wish the Belkin would charge my 3GS, then I'd be in heaven.

..

6006840060008 Overview: This is a great charger that allows cars with the audio aux. plug to get very good audio pumped directly to the cars stereo system.
Pros: Convenient and easy to use, great audio quality, and charges the iPod fairly quickly
Cons: Does offer a cable management system for the audio cable jack but does not offer the same for the iPod adapter jack.
Overall, a great product that I would highly recommend if you like charging your iPod while listening to great quality music playback.

..

6006840060008 I have an iPhone 3GS with an aux jack and charger plug in my center console. I tried several options to charge my iPhone and listen to it at the same time. Most required 2 cables, one aux jack and one charging. With most of the devices I tried, I got great sound with the aux jack ONLY, but distortion/interference when I connected a charger at the same time.
After trying a couple of different options, I stumbled on this at Best Buy. I hooked it up in the parking lot, and Voila'!! - distortion gone and problem solved. Great solution!!

Featuring 24K gold contacts, this 4' HDMI cable ensures improved signal strength between HDMI components.


..

6006840060008 Unlike the guy below cables do make a difference. Cheap and in adequate cables will cause signal loss,easily detach from your source and especially in 3d you will not see the depth thats intented for you to see most bestbuys have that demo to show the differnce. Its funny how they say cables dont make the difference when the inside of cheaper cables have almost no protecting shielding very small gauge as well which allows minimal signal transfer. PLUS CABLE FOR LIFE are you serious you cant go wrong. If technology goes beyond monster will replace your cable FOR FREE !!!!

..

6006840060008 I can't believe how many people are claiming these cables actually make a difference. Do not believe them! A digital signal is a digital signal - as long as you have an HDMI v1.3 cable, it will do the same thing as this expensive one.
Sure, it's easy for me to say don't believe them, but do believe me. Since I can't post a link, do a quick Google search and look for professional reviews (not forums with average consumers) on sites such as CNET or Gizmodo. Then, be happy you saved $145 while getting the same picture and audio quality from your new HDMI cable.

..

6006840060008 I reviewed many websites bashing upscale cables as a waste of money. Those who seek top performance out of their systems could be easy prey to unsubstantiated claims. However the proof is in the pudding. I bought the monster cable for my Pioneer BDP09FD connected to a 65" Panasonic. This was after I had already had it hooked up with a lesser value but quality cable (not quite a "coat hanger" as some bashers claim produce the same results as a high end cable).
My son who was quite skeptical immediately noticed the difference. Even though the picture before was impressive, it was now stunning. My whole family could see an improvement. There is a difference; do not believe the reverse hype. The cables are extremely pricey but they deliver, at least on quality systems.
Finally I am not a "shill" for anyone. I am a consumer like you. I also do not like to waste money. But I believe what my eyes and other's eyes see. Remember you can always take it back.

..

6006840060008 the hdmi cable m series is better than any wire i have ever tried.its performance is fantastic.

..

6006840060008 If you consult with any of the Blu-ray manufacturers (Panasonic, Sony, Samsung, etc.) they will tell you there will be no difference in the picture quality between an inexpensive HDMI cable and the $100+ Monster cables. Read this and educate yourself...

6006840060008 In AUDIO / VIDEO, even a small percentage of discernable difference is worthy of consideration especially when it affects the sound. HDMI is responsible for everything now, sound and video, so it is a very important consideration if using in a worthy system. Long story short, I have been using a $100 HDMI cable from Audioquest who I love, on my Pioneer 05 Bluray. I already had a M1000 HDMI connected to my HDDVD player and for the longest time, it out-shined my Bluray player. I decided to switch the two cables and I don't have the hyperboles to describe the difference, none of which were subtle mind you. Again this was comparing a plus $100 HDMI, not a cheap one.
Findings as follows on 133" Theater Room.
Color: dramatically more saturated.
Detail: Another gear, like having eye surgery.
Motion: I accepted the judder as part of the whole experience (133" screen). Judder is gone! Speed is lightning. Threw in Spider man 3 on all scenes that gave me fits before. NONE now. Same with Cloverfield with all the camera motion. Twister same deal.
Black detail:(Hallmark of any good picture)Sensational. Blacks are not only darker, but detail in dark scenes are unbelievably good now. Always had issues in this department with all other HDMI's used. Not with this one. Dark Knight, is a new movie.
And sound, well being more important then the picture, the sound is just as impressive as the picture. I am using the internal decoding in player (Wolfson Chips) and everything, Bass, Highs, Imaging, DYNAMICS, imerssion and detail have another level.
This cable is under-priced, I would pay a lot more if I knew I would be getting this kind of maximum return.
Especially if your system is worthy and your screen is larger than 50" pay the price and reward yourself and your system.

..

6006840060008 OK. I WAS EXTREMELY SKEPTICAL THAT THIS CABLE WOULD TRULY MAKE BOTH A PICTURE AND AUDIO IMPROVEMENT ON MY SIMPLE SET-UP AT MY OFFICE. ALL I HAVE IS A 6 MONTH OLD VIZIO VP504, 1080P, 50" PLASMA WITH DIRECT TV HR-21 DVR AND A BRAND NEW SONY BDP-S360 BLU-RAY PLAYER. NO SPEAKERS, NO RECEIVERS. JUST THE 3 ITEMS ALONG WITH A BLU-TOOTH WIRELESS HEADPHONE AND ADAPTER THAT I USE JUST ABOUT 100% OF THE TIME AS I'M ALWAYS WALKING AROUND MY OFFICE AND I HAVE TO USE HEADPHONES. WHICH BY THE WAY SOUND INCREDIBLE AND WORK OVER 300 FEET AWAY IN EVERY ROOM OF MU BUSINESS. ANYWAY,WHEN I INSTALLED THE THREE ITEMS, I USED THE CHEAPEE HDMI CABLES THAT CAME WITH THE VIZIO PLASMA AND BLU-RAY. THE 2 HDMI CABLES WERE BOTH LOW END, BUT WERE MADE BY DIFFERENT MANUFACTURER'S. WHEN WATCHING DIRECT TV HD PROGRAMS, ESPECIALLY YANKEES ON YES OR GOLF, PICTURE LOOKED AWESOME. I WAS EXPECTING AND TOLD THE BLU-RAY DVD'S WOULD LOOK EVEN BETTER. HOWEVER TO MY SURPRISE, AS WELL AS ALL MY FRIENDS, THE BLU-RAY DVD'S DID NOT LOOK BETTER. IN FACT, THEY WERE QUITE WORSE. I MESSED AROUND WITH ALL THE SETTINGS, HAD MY AUDIO GUY COME IN AND HE AGREED THE BLU-RAY PICTURE SHOULD LOOK MUCH BETTER AND SHOULD BE BETTER THAN THE DIRECT TV PICTURE AS I HAVE A 1080P PLASMA USING 1080P BLU-RAY DVD'S VS MOST DIRECT TV 780P-1080I PROGRAMMING. HE IMMEDIATLY TOLD ME TO RUN OVER AND BUY 2 GOOD QUALITY MONSTER CABLES. I ARGUED WITH HIM AFTER READING THESE FORUMS AND HOW MANY GUYS STATE THESE "DIGITAL" SIGNALS VS THE OLDER "ANALOG" SIGNALS DON'T NEED OR BENEFIT FROM HIGH END HDMI CABLES AND THAT A $10.00 HDMI WOULD GIVE ME THE SAME PICTURE/AUDIO QUALITY. I REALLY COULDN'T SEE WASTING MONEY ON HIGH END CABLES AS THIS ISN'T IN MY HOME AND IT'S NOT A HIGH END PIONEER PLASMA. I REALLY DIDN'T THINK THESE WOULD MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE AND I REALLY DIDN'T LOOK FORWARD TO SPENDING 25% OF THE COST OF MY PLASMA ON 2 LOUSY CABLES. SO I DECIDED TO TRY SOMETHING 1ST. THE ONLY THING I DID WAS SWAP THE 2 HDMI CABLES FROM THERE INPUTS, SO THE DIRECT TV INPUT WOULD NOW USE THE BLU-RAY PLAYER HDMI CABLE AND VISE VERSA. ABSOLUTLEY NO OTHER CHANGES. WHEN I TURNED THE 3 ITEMS BACK ON TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANY DIFFERENCE (AND I REALLY WASN'T EXPECTING ANY) I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. NOW THE BLU-RAY PLAYER LOOKED ALOT BETTER--NOT FANTASTIC--BUT OBVIOUSLY TO EVERYONE BETTER--AND NOW THE DIRECT TV PICTURE LOOKED WORSE. SO I SUMISED THAT THERE REALLY WAS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EVEN THESE LOW END HDMI CABLES. THIS GAVE ME ENOUGH CONFIDENCE TO GO OVER AND PLUNK DOWN THE $135.00 PER CABLE AND IF I DIDN'T SEE A NOTICABLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PICTURE WITH THE NEW MONSTER VS THE BETTER HDMI CABLE I HAD, I WOULD RETURN IT AND BUY ANOTHER LOWER PRICED, BUT NOT GARBAGE HDMI CABLE. WELL INSTALLED THIS MONSTER CABLE AND I TURNED THE 3 ITEMS ON TO SEE. THE IMPROVEMENT WAS EXTROIDINARY ALL AROUND. BOTH THE PICTURE QUALITY AS WELL AS AUDIO THRU MY HEADPHONES WAS UNBELIEVABLY BETTER, ESPECIALLY WITH THE BLU-RAY CONNECTION. MY MUSIC (FLEETWOOD MAC, RUSH, ETC..) BLU-RAY DVD'S ARE INCREDIBLE. I REALIZE THIS IS AN EXTREMLY LONG POST, BUT I JUST HAD TO INCLUDE ALL THE DETAILS. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO THINK A $15.00 HDMI CABLE WILL WORK EVERY BIT AS GOOD AS A HIGH QUALITY HDMI CABLE--TRUST ME--THEY WON'T. PLEASE DON'T THINK I'M SAYING YOU NEED TO BUY THIS TOP OF THE LINE $150.00 CABLE. I'M SURE A VERY GOOD $50.00-TO PERHAPS $75.00 CABLE WOULD WORK JUST AS WELL. BUT BELIEVE ME, STAY AWAY FROM THOSE VERY CHEAP HDMI'S. I CANNOT BELIEVE THE PICTURE I'M GETTING NOW ON THIS VIZIO PLASMA. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND SPEND THE EXTRA $$ ON THE HDMI CABLE EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE A HIGH END PLASMA. IT TRULY MAKES AN INCREDABLE DIFFERENCE. I KNOW IT'S NOT ALONG THE LINES OF A PIONEER, BUT FOR MY NEEDS, I'M SO STOKED!!!! THIS IS THE PLASMA PICTURE I WAS HOPING TO GET FROM THIS VIZIO AND WITH THE NEW CABLES, IT'S EXCEEDING MY EXPECTATIONS. HOPE THIS HELPS SOMEONE LIKE MYSELF WHO COULDN'T SEE UPGRADING CABLES!!!!!

..

6006840060008 I had my reservations about sinking $170 into a cable. What is the difference between the high end offering by other brands that run around $80 or so and this cable which is twice as much? Well, let me tell you that this cable does what it says. If you own an LCD with the 120MHz motion processor and Directv HD than this is a MUST HAVE. There is noticeable difference in picture response, no blur, pixilation or distortion Improved sharpness and sound. Most noticeable is the depth of color. My wife even noticed this (not an A/V geek like me) and said that the picture looks more life like and the kids cartoons (the CG ones not the Hanna Barberra we grew up with) looked 3D. Over all I am VERY happy. I will be replacing the Sony Blu-Ray cable next to take full advantage of all this great product has to offer.

..

6006840060008 I just got a relatively new 40" Samsung LCD today and got this cable to go along with my 360 and upconvert DVD player (this will get replaced by a PS3 eventually). After watching Transformers and playing Call of Duty 4 and NHL 08 I either ended up with a TV that is better than my parents which I doubt since they have a Pioneer Elite 50" 1080p plasma or my cables are just that much better than their Monster 800 series cables. Not really sure on that one, but the cables aren't hurting it one bit. If your going to invest a large sum of money into a new home theater spend the extra money and get the best stuff from the start otherwise you might regret it later.

..

6006840060008 This HDMI cable brings out the quality and potential that my Samsung LN-T4081F has to offer. I use it with my Blu Ray player and it looks amazing. Planning on getting more of this same cable for my DirecTV and Xbox 360.

Monster Cable XPHP-CI BIG-100 XPHP Advanced Speaker Cable (Bare wire) - 100ft - Clear


..

6006840060008 I've gone through three home theater systems. My first when I was in the 8th grade was a Home Theater in a Box (HTIB) and was a Panasonic. At that time I was thrilled because most grown-ups didn't have what I had. I lived with that system for four years before problems starting occuring, which is when I bought some "Magnolia grade speakers" Mirage. Then I upgraded my speaker wire from regular monster speaker wire (white) to CL3 rated but just the High Performance. Call me crazy, but after one year I completely upgraded my entire system with all new speakers and I upgraded the speaker wire as well. I wanted the best (from Best Buy) and I got it. I got a pair of Definitive Mythos STS, mythos ten center channel, mythos xl gems for surrounds, mythos two's for rears, and a Martin Logan Dynamo subwoofer. After three times of changing speaker wire, I decided to run a little test. To my surprise I could hear a difference between my original wire and my new speaker wire. The difference was about the same as 60hz to 120hz. So it was notable, but wasn't bad. Then I tried High Performance vs "Ultra" High Performance. Ultra High is thicker and I expected a better signal because of it. Didn't notice a difference with my tower speakers or center, but my rears and surround had a LITTLE more umph to them (more depth in the midrange). This is high quality speaker wire, but for the sound difference and extra $70 I don't know if it is worth it. It all depends on what you are running, I recommend this for people like me who look for the best their money can buy but for most people they won't notice much of a difference.

..

6006840060008 At 169.99 for 100 Fett yeah it's kind of expensive especially if your running a 7.1 or 9.1 surround. But then again if your running that type of sytem you've GOT the DOUGH and for the BEST stuff that you buy it's ONLY natural that you would want the BEST speaker wire, right.
Well you've found it. And C'Mon for LESS than $200.00 to hook up the most important item, your speakers, IT IS worth it!

..

6006840060008 This speaker wire is a high quality design and produces very clear sound. This my first home theater so I have not had the pleasure of listening to multiple brands of cables. In that light though, I have mostly monster cables connecting all my devices and the system performs very well. I'm very pleased with the results it produces. I would recommend this cable to anyone who is willing to pay for it.

This modem features wireless-N networking with 25 Mbps speed for fast data transfer. WEP, WPA and WPA2, along with an enhanced firewall, help keep your data secure.


..

6006840060008 Bought this after having trouble with my 5 year old Moto 2210 model finally gave out. Being as I had such good luck with the old Moto I wanted to stay with them and would be nice eliminating a stand alone wireless router as well. Nothing but continuous dropped sync for two days and finally gave up and returned the piece of junk for a cheaper Netgear 150 (which I'm not totally happy with due to a bit slower wifi speed between computers and game consoles for media streaming but it does work and maintains a strong maximum speed connection with no sync problems).
You will need to manually set your VPI & VCI for this thing to function correctly if you have AT&T standard DSL so if you are gonna fight it out then remember this. Hated to jump ship but reliability is king.

..

6006840060008 Works fine as a DSL modem in bridge mode. The router and wireless functionality is quite uneven. One the one hand, it allows for creation of multiple WiFi networks. On the other hand, the port forwarding functionality is somewhat limited, doesn't appear to have full DMZ functionality, and I couldn't get the router to pass an incoming PPTP VPN connection to a server. Also lacks a DynDNS updater client.
Needs new firmware to be anything but a mediocre consumer-grade device.

..

6006840060008 I configured the device as instructed by the installation process and my ISP. The device will not maintain an internet connection. The DSL connection stays lit/connected but the internet connection drops for no apparent reason. Best Buy's support advice was to restart the device. That's equivalent to no support. Motorola has no support unless you have a corporate account. Your ISP will only spend a limited amount of time (if any) on a device they didn't supply. If you buy this device and have a problem don't waste your time, return it and get a different brand. I gave one star because zero wasn't an option.

..

6006840060008 I bought this modem when my NetZero modem failed. The installation was very easy-- thanks to the user-friendly CD Installation Guide. I had my internet connection up and running right away and my wireless devices synced quickly. Thank you Motorola!

..

6006840060008 Had a cisco unit along with a seperate modem. Use Vonage, and have quite a few wireless connections between phones, ipads etc. Also have 2 games systems, Vonage IP phone, and my DirecTV. With all that said, I have a 3.0M Connection, and a 512k Upload. Thats alot of info for such a slow connection, but that is all that is offered in my area. My old Cisco unit would make IP phone impossible unless network traffic was nill. Very slow all around. Swapped to this one, and love it. Data traffic management is great, and allows use of all itam at once with very few problems. Only issue is the set up is marginal at best, and if power goes out, MINE has to re set up agin. Dont know if thats a normal thing. But very happy otherwise.

..

6006840060008 I gave the thing the benefit of the doubt and assigned a 3 to performance & value. I was disappointed after running the install process for the 4th time, in still continued to say cannot find equipment 2247-N8. I really tried to make it work, but it refused. Maybe I bought a bad unit. I returned it a purchased a NG N 300-2200. It was up and running within 15 minutes.

6006840060008 all my problens with p2p, wireless, torrents its over.

38759318 So I got this for Christmas, and I wanted a Microphone that was Cheap, But Good for gaming.... Well, It met most of My Standards, it was great for Chatting and For Gaming, and Pretty much the Sound Quality and Microphone reliability was Good.... However, It's not a Durable Headset.... I would run into the Wires by accident, and the Microphone can break if You're not careful.... and Not to mention, somehow the ear pieces can come off by accident, but they go back in easily in a snap. But overall, It is a Good Headset to start with, and I would definitely recommend this for Business professionals. But for Gamers, try to be careful with this Headset, since it can break If You're not careful with it.....

Hope this review helps others out with getting a Cool new headset.....

Sincerely,
SoundFX09.

..

38759318 I would not buy again if given the chance . Had them about 2 weeks and they fell apart.

..

38759318 This headset is very good for short term use such as phone calls and listening to music. They don't really offer anything special in audio quality and lack bass. The microphone is pretty good and I haven't had any complaints from the people I talk to with it.

The big problem is with the ear pad design. These things are a killer on the ears after more than 30 mins of use. The ear pads are flat and press against your whole ear, which can hurt after a while. I have to take them off just to give my ears a break.

All in all a BASIC headset. You get what you pay for.

..

38759318 A really good buy for the money. Very comfortable to wear for long periods of time. Microphone seems to work well, friends say sound is very good. The in line controls are slimmer then other headsets I have used, so they are less likely to catch on things. The pads collect a bit of hair, but not a big problem. There is no low bass, but they still sound good. To get really good bass it costs at least 2-3 times as much in my experience. So if you don't want to spend a lot on your headset, these are the ones for you.

..

38759318 For 30 bucks your not going to get better....the sound from this headset is off the charts, great bass, and in some of your favorite games it picks up sound you didn't even know exsisted. The mic is great and picks up perfectly, without being in the way, as it is extended off the the side. It fits comfortably and well, at times I don't even hardly notice i'm wearing it.

..

38759318 I bought this after my other headset died on me. I wanted to get one that had 3.5mm jacks instead of USB (it's just easier). I found this for $20 and figured it would be decent. I got home, plugged it in, and started listening to music. For the price, the sound quality is very good. Moreover, it is also quite comfortable. I like it a lot more than the $60 Logitech headset I previously had. The mic quality is also excellent. The only thing I don't like is the ear pieces can pop out of the joint if you're not careful. Of course, all you have to do is just pop it back in. Unfortunately, my dog got a hold of it and chewed one of the foam pads in half. So now I have to deal with that. Maybe tech support can help me get replacement pads?

..

38759318 Bought this headset for a language-learning app. Did not work well. Not sure if it was a user or computer issue or a problem with the headset. Returned it and got a USB headset by Dynex which is working well. (this headset is analog--2 plugs that plug into the mike and phone jacks)

Enjoy your favorite tunes while jogging or working out with this arm band that features durable stretch polyester construction and a protective cover to keep your iPhone safe.


..

40278103 I've used this on 2 long runs and many short ones, so far it works great. The only drawback is the plastic screen. it makes it hard to see and it is not real touch sensitive.

..

40278103 Might work well for some but not so great for me. Doesn't fit if you have bigger arms

..

40278103 I am a road cyclist and love this arm band for my I Phone. It adjusts to anyone's arm size and keeps my phone in place while I ride. This allows me to listen to music on my rides which is so helpful and much needed on long rides!

..

40278103 Poorly made paid way too much this should be priced at $9.95 to match how badly it's made. Ugly looking and not good for larger arms. Total waste of money!

..

40278103 I hate having to remove my iPhone from its OtterBox to use this. The plastic is not tight enough, so I am unable to use the touchscreen to access my workout apps. I wish I had not wasted my money on this.

..

40278103 Do not bother wasting your money on this item. The armband is either too loose or too tight. It was slipping off of my arm during my entire work out. The screen protector feels like cheap plastic that isn't tight to the screen. In other words, when you try to swipe on your phone, you can't because the plastic is too loose to do so. I can't even begin to tell you how disappointed with this purchase I am. I will be returning the item tomorrow.

..

40278103 The neoprene material makes my arm really hot when exercising. Fastening buckle is more challenging than the Belkin FastFit. Got that model when I returned this one.

..

40278103 In order to place your iPhone in the armband, you must first take it out of the other protective case you may have the device in, then slide it into the armband. It is a pain to constantly swap from one form or protection to the other. After doing this for a week, both protective covers are now loose. I would like to find a case that snaps on to an armband. I had one like this for my previous iPods, and never had any issues.

6006840400006 overall very satisfied, . the fan is a little bit loud but for that price is ok, not disturbing

..

6006840400006 It was easy a breeze to set up and manage. We found it a bit darker than we'd like watching a movie. When I tried to use it to display a document it was so dark that I had to get 2 feet from the screen just to read it. It was in focus yes, and yes the plastic was removed from the lens. So we returned it. As great of an idea as it was, this unit just didn't work.

6006840400006 I have been working with Dell for 3 months trying to solve this problem but the printer will go into sleep mode and my pc cannot find it. I have to turn it off then back on to print anything. Dell tech support cannot solve the issue. Worse they will not allow me to return the printer. Now to print something I have to power it down and back up. I will not buy any more Dell products.

Griffin Survivor for iPad - iPad - Black - Silicone, Polycarbonate


..

6006840400006 I am very pleased with this case. No issues with it so far and it does as intended, which is protect my ipad. Stylsh color as well.

..

6006840400006 Really bulky, camera lens was cover at all times, bought another cover.

..

6006840400006 I think the product does what it is meant to do, though I haven't dropped or wet my iPad yet. The clip is relatively easy to come off and I already lost it. Also it is rather difficult to open the clip into standing position.

..

6006840400006 Works great got a great price very happy! Survived a vacation in the car over 5000 miles

..

6006840400006 Overall, i'm happy with the purchase, the case it tough, easy to hold, protects the ipad well enough, but the fit isn't perfect. When snapping the device in, one corner of the case wouldn't completely latch on, leaving a bit of give when you apply pressure. If dropped specifically in this spot, the give my lead to damage, but overall its very secure. If you don't mind it not being a perfect fit, for the price, it does the job.

..

6006840400006 I would definitely recommend this case to a friend. It's durable and long lasting.

..

6006840400006 Very good product if your looking for a strong way to protect an expensive investment and extend the lifespan of the ipad. It is easy to assemble and provides good strong cover that enables the ipad to be taken almost anywhere with minimal risk to damaging the product. Very good investmetn from a company that makes some of the best protective cases for the iphone.

..

6006840400006 I liked the looks of this product but it did not fit into the purse I carry my I pad in.

..

6006840400006 Protects the ipad very well especially from messy kids hands. Just wipe it off and is like new. Also protects from falls. Feels sturdy enough to absorb shocks but is comfortable to hold onto

..

6006840400006 After my kids dropped our 4th generation iPad onto our hard tile floors for the 3rd time in 14 months (each time meant a new screen...thank goodness I had a protection plan) I finally decided to get some protection. This unit appealed to my younger girls (pink) and to me because of its Military Grade Rating. Still not water proof...but water resistant. Shock durability was a big plus for me. I made a video review of this item. Check it out. Although this product wasn't as rigid as I hoped, it does seem to offer solid protection. Recommend.

Everyday computing just got easier with the HP Notebook. Enjoy true reliability on the road or at home with a simple yet powerful value-packed notebook that gets the job done.


..

6006840400006 This computer is a piece of junk. Worked 1 & half days. Has been doing "repairing disk errors" for the past 10 hours. LOL HP computers are not as good as they used to be.

..

6006840400006 This laptop runs so slow. I should have returned it right away, but I did not use it right away, had to wait for someone to help me get it set up and that took several weeks, so by time I realized it is to late to return.

..

6006840400006 This was purchased for my daughter for college. Button spacing and positioning isn't quite right and don't press quite right. Seems to miss the letters. Battery is terrible. She used for 20 minutes then closed the cover for the night and the battery was dead the next morning.

..

6006840400006 We like being able to use it around the house, instead of one place. Windows 8 is new to us. We just have to get used to this program .

..

6006840400006 great geek support as came with windows 8 program & needed help

..

6006840400006 Returned product after first use. Was not happy with quality or operation of it

..

6006840400006 There are many things on this machine I haven't learned how to use yet, but HP Support is great. I had heard how screwed up 8.1 was, and hard to use, but not really that bad. The problem is Microsoft clashing with other than their programs I choose to use. Would say more, but haven't had it long enough yet.

Print crisp black-and-white documents with this HP LaserJet Pro MFP M127fn all-in-one printer that features print speeds up to 21 ISO ppm* for fast completion of work. The scanner offers up to 1200 dpi optical resolution for clear, detailed images.


..

6006840400006 All in all it is a excellent printer/fax/scanner/and copier especially since we use it in a very fast paced and busy office. After learning how everything worked it is great. No matter what you need done it takes seconds to do it. The best part is the amount of toner it uses. We print and copy lots of things on a day to day basis and it is not even close to running out of toner compared to our old ink jet printer that used ink very rapidly. This printer has saved us lots of time and money.

..

6006840400006 Used mostly as a printer scanner copier and has been working great.

Learn more about the New WindowsWith built-in wireless networking, this Asus M70ADUS003S desktop lets you easily access Web content. NVIDIA GeForce GTX 650 graphics with 1GB of dedicated video memory enable you to enjoy lush visuals when connected to a display (not included).


..

6006840400006 Asus is a major player in the manufacturing of Motherboards, video cards and peripherals for computers for about 25 years now so it's a no-brainer that a direct intel partner would come up with a winning combination of computer technology to create a very fast desktop with some ingenuity and sure enough Asus came up with a very unique desktop that sets itself apart.
Looking at the specs we see the M70AD looks respectable in the hardware department intel i7 4th generation processor, 16GB of DDR3 1600Mhz Memory (8Gx2 Installed) and it appears this unit uses a micro atx board so 2 slots are all that's available, this might be unacceptable to those of you that work in the video/graphics world and most likely upgrading to it's max memory of 32GB would be quite a costly affair considering what a single 16GB module would cost. Still for most people 16GB is overkill and adequate for their needs.
An Nvidia GTX 760 1GB video card is a very nice mid-range selection for this computer obviously not designed for pro-gamers or power users who edit video on a professional scale but for the average user this video card is more than enough to play today's video games with decent frame rates and detail turned up to take advantage of today's game graphics.
I talked my folks into buying this model since their 10+ year old desktop was slowing them down I stressed to them the importance of buying a computer from the very company that engineers the internal parts and they agreed and now they enjoy the speed of this computer that never slows down for anything it is a juggernaut a brute that can calculate zero's & one's as good as some higher priced big named computers.
Hard Drive space is ample at 1 TB with the added mSATA ssd used for caching it surely speeds things up being that the Sata 1 TB hard drive is about the only bottleneck this computer has so with all caching going to the lightning fast ssd msata we have a quick response time on startups coming out of sleep mode and loading programs it just rips right through everything you use on a daily basis.
Optical drives are becoming like Swiss army knives and this computer offers you a CD/DVD burner that is also Blu-ray compliant which means it will play your Blu-rays no problem just not burn Blu-ray discs.
On the front upper panel you will find a 16 in 1 card reader with two USB 2.0 and two 3.0 slots so everything is covered here and it is easily accessible. In the rear four USB 2.0 slots are provided. Whats really nifty is the front panel door slides down and out of the way which is much nicer than a swinging door to cover your drives and open slots.
One thing you will notice about this computer is how quiet it is sometimes you won't be sure if its even running and almost no heat is sensed these things my folks were very happy about their last unit was loud and put out warmth.
I have always used ASUS motherboards and Video graphics cards for the past 10 years on my custom builds this is what I stressed to my folks and I do the same for you... Trust ASUS they are the producers of the finest computer parts in the world and now they make a fine desktop as well its super fast..super quiet and reasonably priced considering you are getting alot of power for the cost of a laptop.
Thrown in it's own power backup system in case of a power outage..yes it will give you the time to save your work before it shuts down & the fact that this computer has a tray on-top that will charge your smart phone with no power cables attached and with your smart phone you can login and access files which are important to business users that need syncing of important data all the way round this Asus is a top choice in my book and a great value.

..

6006840400006 This was my first desk purchase top in over a decade and I wanted something really nice, as well as already loaded with Windows 8.1. This is an impressive piece of hardware with far more features than I am ever likely to use. Speed is incredible and the graphics are outstanding so that only hardcore gamers might want more power. There is plenty of memory so unless you do video editing you will be just fine. The cabinet is quite attractive and not nearly as large as it looks in the photos. It runs very quietly and stays cooler than I had expected, although I do run an auxiliary off one of the front USB connections. he only issue is the lack of USB connections at the rear; there are only four and all are USB2. Figuring a keyboard, mouse, my Bose sound system, web camera/microphone, and the printer...Well, it come up short. The printer and the Bose system won't run well (the Bose not at all# off a USB hub and the wireless mouse also dislikes it. Realistically two more USB connectors in the back would be fine but four more would be even better! There are two USB2 and two USB3 connections in the front as well as the DVD/Blue ray device, along with headphones and microphone connections, all of which can be neatly covered by the sliding door giving a smooth and attractive look to the unit #although my girlfriend claims it looks like a refrigerator!#. Set up was easy; it booted and loaded right up and was ready to use in just minutes. I currently connect a 27" #HDMI# in landscape, a 17" #VGA# monitor in portrait as well as a 24" HDTV #HDMI), all with no issues and I think it will support even more displays than that if you need them. For daily use this is way above anything that you'd ever need but for guys like myself who just like neat toys, watch movies and play games at a moderate level it impossible to find fault with it, save the need for more USB connections. The mouse and keyboard are very average and since chances are you will be using your own devices so they are not worth discussing.

..

6006840400006 I bought this computer to replace an old laptop that was extremely slow. I am amazed how fast this computer is. I click and it's done. No waiting 20 minutes for it to boot up either. It is the quietest computer I have ever seen. You don't even know it is on. Although this was a little overkill for me, it means I won't have to buy another computer for a long, long time.

..

6006840400006 This is a fast, quiet, sleek and so far reliable desktop pc and has lots of great features.

Crank the volume from your Bluetooth-enabled audio device with this Ion Audio Road Rocker Bluetooth speaker system, which features a 2-way speaker for rich, dynamic sound. The rechargeable battery allows up to 50 hours of playback between charges.


..

6006840400006 loved this item, price was incredible and so convient to travel with.its like a mobile party you control.

..

6006840400006 I purchased this audio to use in Physical Education classes outside. Design is great and not many buttons or controls makes it simple and easy to operate. It is not going to do the job, simply because the sound is distorted bad at higher volume. If listening on volume 3-4, the sound is OK. With the increase of the volume, somewhere at level 5-6, the base sounds terrible. Playing audio with no base was fine on higher volume.
I'd like to have the same system with quality speakers, that can handle the volume coming from the amp.

..

6006840400006 Saw it for cheap. Been eyeing an outdoor/portable/bluetooth speaker for awhile. The higher end one had a radio on it, but I figured that I could use an app instead.
Got it and was very excited...until I turned it up past the 4th notch....and the distortion began.
It wasn't even at LOUD yet. Changed the setting on my phone to help. They didn't.
Contacted company. Have not heard back from them.
I don't recommend...unless I have a defective one and if this isn't normal, then I would...it's got a lot of fun features.

..

6006840400006 This ION Road Rocker is a decent size, easy to take around with you at the pool, around the house, in the back yard, in the car... etc. The sound is loud enough to hear from far away even outside. It has very good sound, but not audiophile quality. However, I was a little disappointed with the bass response. I was expecting a little more since its in a larger box shape. Behind the sturdy black mesh grille is a 3.5 inch woofer, a 1 inch tweeter and 3/4 inch bass port. With my phone paired, I can crank the volume up to about the 7th mark before it starts getting distorted. So if you have a quiet song you should be able to crank it all the way up without distortion. The PA function kind of sucks. If you want to hear yourself talk or sing, you have to crank up the mic volume and lower the main volume as whatever is playing on the main volume will over-power the mic. The USB charging port on top next to the dock only works when the charger is plugged into the Road Rocker. You cannot use the main battery to charge your device. The dock is kind of narrow, so if you have a bulky phone + case it may have a hard time sitting in there. The shiny corner protectors are a nice feature to protect from bumping while carrying it around. On the back of the box are 3 green LED lights that tell you the charge level of the battery. I ran this box continuously for at least 10 hours before the first LED light turned off. Don't let the battery run to nothing, make sure you charge it as it says after each long use. The bluetooth range is about 20-30 feet depending if you have walls in the way of the speaker and your playing device. I use this thing almost every day and I'm very pleased with it. For the price and features it has you can't beat this Road Rocker.

..

6006840400006 This is a decent sounding headphone. The highs are bright the mids are full bodied and the lows are pretty decent. The sound is better than your typical headphone and the cost is commensurate with headphones of this quality. The really good feature about these headphones is the tangle free chord. Decent sounding headphones for the price.

Power your Toshiba Equium A200 or PA3534U laptop for up to 10 hours with this Laptop Battery Pros TS1030B lithium-ion battery that features 10.8V and 7800 mAh for extended use.


..

6006840400006 I had initial problems getting the Laptop to get this battery to charge up. Not sure what the problem was. I had this problem with a previous replacement battery. They must coat the contacts with something that keeps the battery from connecting to the contacts of the Laptop. After several attempts to snap it in place properly then the battery started to charge and work properly. Very happy now with the extended life of the battery.

..

6006840400006 This is my second Battery Pros purchase. I bought one for my HP earlier in the year and it's been great. This one is for my Daughters Compaq. This has a very long charge life. The way they achieve this is by incorperating an extension of about 1 inch into the bottom heighth of the battery. This makes the laptop raise up in the back at a slight angle. They do not explain this in the description but they do tell you the dimensions and the heighth is an inch more than the standard battery. That is why you will notice several batteries under the same model number. Some will not have this feature. For me and my family this is not an issue. For others, this may be a turn off. This battery rocks for the price!

6006840400006 This is my second one of these. It's actually for a friend but it's just one of the nicest keyboards from Logitech yet. I love the look of the keyboard. I love the ease of setting it up. I love the lighted keys. I love the compact size. I've always used the bigger programmable keyboards from Logitech but this one just fits better with the system I've built for my wife. BTW, she loves it too!

6006840400006 I had to replace keyboard that came with my computer after only 2 months. The sales rep recommended it. I have been very happy with my purchase. It was very easy to install. Quiet. Keys don't stick. I like the fact that it uses solar energy, too.

..

6006840400006 Best key board I I ever used ligohtweight and able to use with
Only one USB port

..

6006840400006 I've had this for a few weeks now, and haven't had a problem with it. It's nice to know I don't have to buy batteries for a wireless keyboard, and the connection between the keyboard and my PC is flawless. No lag whatsoever. It's a great addition for your PC, especially if you want to cut out wires going to and from.
Key response is perfect, and it's slim profile fits well with any computer setup. I highly recommend this keyboard.

..

6006840400006 This is my second one. I spilled a drink on my first one after having it for a couple of years and it damaged the solar panel and wouldn't recharge. So far this one has been great. They have made some improvements. Just make sure you don't spill any liquids on it.....

..

6006840400006 I was looking for a wireless mouse and keyboard to help reduce the river of cords plugged into our outlets. The Solar Wireless Keyboard stood out from the crowd of offerings on the Best Buy shelf. It uses solar power, not just from sunlight, but also from the regular lighting in your house. This really appeals to my energy consciousness. The design is super slim and the keys feel great under my fingers when I type. Cleaning it is a breeze and it stays shiny with the swipe of a soft cloth. It was a little more expensive than the other wireless keyboard, but I had to try it and I'm glad I did. I like it much better than any keyboard I have ever used. Now my friends want one.

..

6006840400006 This item is super easy to install configure to multi sync so I only have to use one Logitech USB dongle. extreamly reliable.

..

6006840400006 Compact and slim, this keyboard has a great touch/feel and holds a solsr charge for a long time. Even indoors away from any window it gets its charge for long enough that you don't have to worry about its reliability.

..

6006840400006 It's a wireless keyboard that does not require batteries. That's generally it in a nutshell. The keyboard is in a bedroom where it receives moderate light and has yet to dip below 96%, and even when that low, gets back to 100% after a few hours without use. I generally am on my PC 3 to 4 hours a day.
My only complaint is some occasional input lag where the keyboard takes several seconds to respond. Thus far in about 3 months, this has happened only twice. It seems to last until I unplug the unifying receiver then plug it back in. Otherwise, it more than serves its purpose.

..

6006840400006 Flat, doesn't slide around, quiet, no batteries, easily switches between computers, has a number pad I could go on and on

..

6006840400006 Love the ease of use. Setting up was easy and quick. I use it with my MAC and it works just as seamlessly as my MAC specific keyboards.

..

6006840400006 I had to send the product back to Mach Speed for a few glitches. Mach Speed customer service was prompt and courteous as we communicated via email and phone. They quickly sent a replacement even before they received the defective product. Not sure how their other products are, but they got it right in customer service.

..

6006840400006 Horrible product, but it was super cheap so I wasn't expecting anything 'great'. Even with low expectations the product still managed to surprise me with it's terrible lack of compatibility and clunky web-surfing abilities. Tried it out for 10 days and returned it since there aren't many apps compatible with it's processor and even something as simple and time-tested as browsing the internet seems to be a real chore for this little device.
Google Playstore runs after some hacking, but none of the apps will load from that store. On the Amazon store most apps I tried to load ended up saying the device wasn't compatible, but I did manage to get a few working.
The OOB so called "app store" is nothing more than a static web page with a few links to 10 or less apps that actually work on the product. It's a few games and a few productivity apps, nothing special.

..

6006840400006 the tablet itself is really great for what I use it for. The only problem I have so far is finding a case for it, there all to big or to small and the only good ones I can find put the power button in a bad location

6006840400006 Have an inexpensive Garmin that I purchased several years ago. Bought this to upgrade, because I could update maps. Without the auto zoom as speeds change I will be right on top of a turn or destination before it shows on the map. When turned on it takes so long for it to start receiving signals I can drive two or three blocks and it still thinks I'm in the driveway. Same thing if a turn is missed or there is a detour. Also I can be driving in the right lane and go through an intersection and this things thinks I turned right. Very disappointed. I've gone back to the old Garmin. MONEY WASTED

..

6006840400006 I got this item on sale for under a hundred dollars, works fine, no problems. Happy customer

..

6006840400006 2 days after I placed the order it arrived.
The item was brand new, and right out of the box it didn't work.
After it was connected to the car charger, it still did not power on.
I am very disappointed in Magellan in recent years.
I immediately returned it, and got the Tom Tom Via 1605TM.
It was definitely worth the $50 difference.
I suggest you look at the Tom Tom Via 160

An eco-friendly design and energy-conserving features help save cost, as well as the environment.


..

6006840400006 At the outset, let me make two statements. First, I am verty impressed with this system, and will explain why in the words that follow. Second, I am not in any way shape or form associated with Acer, nor do I (as far as I know) own any stock in that company, In fact, Acer gobbled up two companies I didn't care much for - Gateway and Packard Bell. If you are what you eat, this system would have proven that. Fortunately it did not.
To begin with, here was what I was looking for:
Portable, preferably 14": I often find myself traveling - the portability has become more important to me over time
Windows 7 Professional: Proven performance without the silliness of Metro
Discrete graphics: Not a gamer, but I do a lot of video editing on Adobe Premiere
Minimum 3 USB ports: I had three on my last 15.4" laptop and it was barely enough
HDMI port: Why not? I'd like that capability, having used it on the last machine I owned
Backlit keyboard: When I need to take one of my frequent glances down at the keys, it's nice to see them...
Bluetooth: Bluetooth peripherals mean free USB ports
Everything else? Gravy. I didn't think my price range (hugging the thousand dollar line) would even accommodate my list with any true quality, nor did I think I be lucky enough to find it all in one package. And things were not looking good. Best Buy's marketplace filtering algorithm didn't help. In fact, it completely missed. Selecting for dedicated graphics excluded this laptop, and I found it only after I had already ordered the Windows 8 Asus Vivobook V301! Fortunately, I was able to cancel that order. Word of caution: it might be worth wading through the choices without relying on the filters.
This system ticked all my boxes and just kept on ticking. Having used it for almost a week, I have no buyer's remorse about what I think is one of the best deals out there on a quality laptop. I suspect this one will be overlooked by many searching the Acer Aspire line. It's not as sexy or flashy as a V7, but it's business-like exterior reflects some serious construction and design. This system is all about durability, performance and capability.
Durability
The carbon fiber shell built around a magnesium alloy cage FEELS like quality. This is a very solid build. Even the lid/screen is sturdy, with minimal flex. Holding the base of the system and pushing with one finger at either corner of the screen, I was able to easily go from closed to full open (about 160 degrees) and closed again with almost no deforming torque on the lid, and definitely no impact on the pixels of the screen. That not only speaks for the lid, but also for the solid metal hinges, which seem perfectly calibrated for smooth motion and accurate positioning.
There is no flex in the keyboard, and despite my concern after reading a review of the short key travel, the key presses are even, consistent and give good tactile feedback. A fledgling touch-typist, the position of the touch pad is not an issue, as it was on my VAIO (where a glance of the wrist sent the cursor scurrying to the top of the page in the middle of typing a sentence).
Performance
Boot-up to the log-in screen takes 14 seconds, and log-in takes about 8 seconds (mainly for my ESET antivirus splash screen to disappear). MS Word loads in less than two seconds. Photoshop CS5 loads in 3 seconds. The snappiness is due in large part to the solid state drive. You'll notice it wasn't on my list - and there was a reason. At the price point I was looking, I doubted that was something I could afford. Having never used SSD before, I also had the advantage - now gone - of not knowing what I was missing. Considering the speed and projected (but not proven) reliability of solid state drives over the spinning mechanics of hard disk drives, it would seem to make all the sense for SSD to be on the priority list of any new laptop PC.
The performance comes down to details. Like all 3 USB ports meeting 3.0 standards. Like 8 GB dual channel RAM with room for expansion. Like pairing it all together with a fourth generation i-core processor and solid state drive resulting in almost no bottlenecks. I am convinced that it's really more than just throwing a bunch of great components together. This system was carefully thought out, and it shows.
Capability
The capacity to do work is more than just about speed. It's about the ability of the system to handle the graphics load, carry the data, connect to the network, accommodate the USB peripherals, provide usable power for extended periods without an AC receptacle, and keep things secure.
The SSD is generous in terms of size. Not sure 256 GB is enough? In addition to Windows 7 Pro, I have full Microsoft Office and Adobe suites installed. Added to a few other programs like my anti-virus (NOD32), Revo, etc - I have only used about 64 GB. There is an open bay for another internal drive (SSD or HDD) in case expansion is required, but the connecting cable is not included.
Security is serious on this business-class machine - from the fingerprint reader to Acer's own management software, it is reminiscent of the ThinkPad's approach.
Another amazing capability is the battery. The Haswell i7/4500U processor uses half the power of the third generation (Ivy Bridge) CPU. Translation? Amazing battery life! After the first charge, I wanted to recycle the battery two or three times to full depletion. On my old VAIO EB - no problem - leave it on and find it dead in 2-3 hours. This Acer? It took nearly nine hours of word processing, browsing and the occasional online video to deplete my system to shut down.
The one category I did not mention was value. I will say that I saw a lot of laptops costing much more that offered less.
I honestly cannot think of many negatives in this price class, although I suppose I could list a lot of improvements comparing it outside it's class. I do wish the ports had a better layout - two of the three USB ports are front right, and interfere with the use of an external mouse for righties like me. The screen is plenty bright - at 14", I can see at full HD and still keep the icons set to small with no magnification factors. That said, it is not quite as brilliant as my glossy VAIO screen. And I'll say it shamelessly - I wish it looked a bit cooler. Like that silver Acer Aspire V7. My VAIO was blue. It didn't do much, but it sure looked good not doing it.
So far, having owned a Dell Latitude, an IBM (now Lenovo) ThinkPad and a VAIO, this is by far the best one. It won't be the prettiest or sleekest looking laptop at Starbucks. But it'll blow the others out of the water with what's under the hood.

..

40686992 Overall, this product is OK for the money. The box is great, sets up easily and fairly easy to use. The accessories however are flimsy. Tripod will be great for a tiny camera like a GoPro but thats about it. The lights are easy to use but very unstable. Instructions are non-existent which was a problem when one of the bulbs burned out within 15 minutes. FYI  To replace the bulb twist counter clockwise about 60 deg to remove the bulb. (I broke the bulb trying to figure that one out) It takes a GU10 base MR16, instructions would have been helpful for this part. Other than that, this unit does what it was made for, creating an environment for taking close up product shots.

Transfer your files, user accounts and settings from a PC with Windows XP, Vista or 7 to a PC with Windows 8 using this 8' Belkin F4U060 easy transfer cable, which features USB connectors for a simple connection. On-screen prompts guide you through the process.


..

38708104 I read all the information that Best Buy had available on their site for this item to make sure I could use on my systems and the most important part they left out. I didn't find that out until I received the product. It will work from 32 bit systems to 32 or 32 to 64 bit systems but will not work if you have a 64 bit to 32 bit and 64 to 64 bit system.
All the spec info on the site says you can transfer files from windows xp vista and 7 to windows 8. It says nothing about 32 or 64 bit systems.

..

38708104 Didn't work for me, not sure why. Might be a waste of money to purchase. Maybe it is just my no computer knowledge skills. LOL

..

38708104 quick set up and use. It took more time to get it out of the package than to hook up and start the file transfer.

..

38708104 Had to finally replace my computer of 12 years and I was amazed at how much data was transferred that I had forgotten about.

..

38708104 needed to transfer data from several devices. this worked great no matter what devices were being used.

..

38708104 Works great. Very easy to use and hook up. It is very easy to use with the instructions that are provided.

..

38708104 Excellent product, literally does all of the work for you. Only downside is you cannot choose which files to transfer, or at least if you could I didn't see how.

..

38708104 THIS WAS EASY TO TRANSFER FROM ONE COMPUTER TO ANOTHER

..

38708104 We bought this when we bought a new computer, at the salesmens suggestion to make things easier. It did not work at all. We took it back to best buy, but we live 100 miles away, so we did it after the 15 day return policy limit. So they would only give us store credit and deducted almost $10 for "Restocking Fee".

..

38708104 trying to use a cable between two comps doesn't work, oh yeah the people at best buy totally convinced my parents that it was a good buy, um no. i am comp literate and this thing confused the hell out of me. told me one thing, then another, made no sense at all. definitely not worth the buy if anything get a flash drive and transfer from one comp to another or have the geek squad do it. waste of money.

Belkin SurgePro BV106050-CW 6-Outlets Surge Suppressor - 6, USB - 900 J - 5 V DC Output


..

38708104 Loved the product and was on sale when I ordered. Can't beat $9 for this.

..

38708104 It works for all iDevices, but not my TouchPad. :(

..

38708104 Purchased Belkin 6-Outlet Surge Protector(Model: BV106050-CW) a little over a month ago(am outside the 30 day return period).
It worked fine for the first month and it stopped working(wouldn't charge or power anything).
Contacted BestBuy and they said its outside the 30 day return period.
Contacted Belkin and they said BestBuy is not an authorized online reseller, so they will not help!

..

38708104 It's a product with great features, The USB works probably. I like yet

..

38708104 There's a plastic post that's intended to be inserted into the grounding pole of the second in a dual pole outlet. It doesn't line up perfectly on some of the newer outlet covers. When I first used this device, the plastic pole was bent out of shape and I removed it. I think it's only for stability, anyway and may not be needed. Anyway, this multi-outlet extension is great, because you almost never have enough outlets in hotel rooms. In addition, there are two USB charging outlets that are really useful to charge both our iPhones every evening. I'm impressed with this device, especially since it's protected by Belkin surge protector technology.

..

38708104 USB ports worked for a few minutes. The USB ports no longer charge my devices. The regular ports work fine. Don't buy this if you plan on using the USB ports to charge devices.

..

38708104 I have a ton of Apple stuff and if you own it and you use it, which I do, it is always needing to be recharged. I automatically just plug my Iphone in when I walk in the house. My wife does the same thing, so having two plugs really helps and being able to plug in 6 other items and having a surge protector is a bonus. I also have a couple of Ipods, and Ipad and some other devices that require USB charging so this is handy for that as well. I have one in my kitchen, my living room, and the bedroom, since I use the Ipone as my alarm clock and it needs charging there as well. This is a high powered charger and can charge some of the larger items like the Ipad with no problem.

..

38708104 The specs for this surge protector state that the usb ports are capable of 1.6A. The label on the back says 750 mA for each port. That would be a total of 1.5A, not 1.6A. The main reason I purchased this was to charge my phone and tablet.

..

38708104 I actually love this thing. I was a bit concerned there would be an issue with the USB charging port for my phone. If I used an aftermarket charger with my HTC Evo 3d, the touchscreen would act funky while it was plugged in. I was hoping that wouldn't happen using the charging ports on this surge protector. The phone works fine while plugged in! It charges normally, as well.
I like the fact that I can screw this in to the outlet so I don't have to worry about it falling off of the wall.

Bytecc External Slimline Floppy Drive - 1.44MB - 1 x Type A USB 2.0 USB - 3.5" External

38708104 I needed a floppy drive to access some old files. I have Windows 7 and all I had to do was plug it in and I was able to immediately access the files I needed to. Great device, great price! And when the first one they sent didn't work, IT Wholesalers sent another one out right away.

..

38708104 I couldn't find anywhere in the description on what versions of Windows that supported this USB drive. If I had seen it, I would have looked elsewhere because I need this item for Windows 8.1 or Windows 7....

These Cisco Linksys PLEK400 Powerline A/V adapters allow you to network your Ethernet-enabled devices, including PCs, game consoles and more. HomePlug A/V technology features up to 200 Mbps speed for fast data transfer.


..

38708104 Unbelieveably easy to install, exceptional performance. Simple as take the device out of the box, plug into your routher (with an ethernet cord), plug into a wall socket; plug the second adaptor into the second device's wall socket and plug that internet capable device (via ethernet cord) to the adaptor, and no matter the house location the second device receives exceptional high speed interent coverage.

This Cisco Linksys EA2700-NP dual-band wireless router features MIMO technology to enable fast data streaming and increased range and reliability. Four 10/100/1000 Gigabit Ethernet ports allow easy connection of peripherals.


..

38708104 don't waste your money! I've had COUNTLESS problems with this router, calling customer service at least 20 times since I've had it (not kidding). by the way, each call lasted over an hour without a solution - most of the time i figured it out myself. oh and its app enabled apparently? none of that worked on my iPhone or iPad. the cisco name has always lived up to its name thus far but now I'm confident that ill never buy any cisco product ever again.

..

38708104 Worked perfectly until it went up. If you need normal internet speeds, get this router.

..

38708104 Nothing fabulous but nothing bad either. Time will tell if the router is a good purchase as my old router(different brand) degraded after a year.

..

38708104 Allows gigabit throughput which lets me take advantage of higher network speeds other than 10/100 only. Looks good, works great and has surprisingly large range.
Recommend not sticking it in an enclosed space because it does give off heat. The more open the location the better. Allow some air around it.

..

38708104 Bought it for the parental control features. The higher speeds were a bonus for the price and kid safety.

..

38708104 Works great for making our desktop wireless. It only took me a few minutes to install.

..

38708104 The signal is weak and drops too often. Lucky to get 3 bars on connection even though my router is only 20 feet away and in line of sight. My old adapter had 5 bars 90% of the time and only dropped service rarely.

..

38708104 No software, no hassle. Just plug to you r usb port, enter your network key and you are connected. I had an internal pci card with an antenna in the back...it was slow and unreliable. With this usb adapter I always have fast and reliable internet on my desktop!

..

38708104 I purchased this for a friend who wanted to connect her tower pc to her internet wirelessly. This product is great! The installation was completed in less than 5 minutes and now her tower PC is wireless. There is no lag in the download or upload speed. Great product!

38708104 THIS PRODUCT WORKS GOOD EASY TO USE SELF INSTALL NO PROBLEMS WINDOWS 7 READY

..

38708104 I'm running Windows 7 and it was literally just plug it in and we were online as soon as I entered my security key.

..

38708104 i bought this for my home theater setup about a month ago. i have a winxp desktop PC that i repurposed for my home theater. got a new HDMI equiped video card, blu ray drive for movies, wireless keyboard, and this usb wireless adapter.
reason i went with this is because i was worried about signal issues if i bought an internal wireless. wanted to ability to move the adapter around. also i trust the cisco name.
unfortunately, the installation was TOO simple. and i wasn't able to configure it specifically for my wireless setup. the setup is too streamlined. wished there was an advanced options or something to change the encryption type and length of the key, etc... this caused problems with initial setup. i was able to get it to work only after manually adding the wireless network via windows then installing the basic drivers for this adapter. if there was an advanced option for the setup, this would get 4 stars from me probably.
i've had quite a bit of dropped connections. transferring files from pc to pc in my network has been unreliable. moving a digital copy of a movie over has been very challenging with dropped connections. and i had netflix problems a couple times. im still investigating the dropped connections problem right now so i can't blame it on the adapter for sure but my other laptops at home do not experience this problem. they may have dropped connections occassionally but my home theater PC that uses this adapter will drop connection several times a day.
but.... for the price, u get a easy to setup wireless adapter. if u have a basic wireless setup at home then u wouldn't be complaining about setup. its a good price, easy setup, and when its connected it works fine. besides my dropped connections (which im still trying to isolate) im pretty satisfied.

..

38708104 Bought this product for a Compaq desktop running Vista but was very disatisfied because unit did not work as expected. Software comes embeded in unit including setup. Unit does not work if you turn computer with unit already left connected from previous use, unless you unplug and plug the unit again. Takes a long time for the computer to realize there is an wireless adapter. Transmission is not as fast as they claim. Not worth the price. packing box comes empty without specs or instruc.

..

38708104 see review @ Cisco Valet Plus router. Easy to install. Very good to excellent range.

..

38708104 This purchase was to bring an old (ca 2003) Dell pc into the wireless age. We recently transitioned from a wired network to a wireless network and the Cisco wireless hotspot and Valet connector did it with ease. I have very little networking knowledge and the set up was a breeze.

Stay informed while you're on the road with this radar detector that features 14-Band protection, including protection from X-Band, K-Band and Ka-Band radars. Visual alerts are displayed on your iPhone's screen for easy viewing.


..

38708104 You get what you pay for. This is a useless product

..

38708104 You really can't go wrong with this product. It's sleek, low-profile, and the app for the iPhone is easy to use. For the cost, it's great. You're able to save money on the other "full-featured" stand alone models because you're really only buying the detector head. All the software and features that are normally packaged inside the stand alone units, are in the app for this. So the manufacturer can cut the price down on these.
If I had to nit-pick something on this, it would be that if you leave it plugged into your car and walk away with your iPhone, it won't automatically re-sync once the car is started. You have to unplug it, then plug it back in. A minor annoyance, but worth mentioning.

..

38708104 I have had this for 3 days now. It has worked great for me and you can't beat the price! You have the option to record false alarm areas and report traps to a data base instantly. Very user friendly and very discrete when hard wiring it to your car. Hides nicely behind your mirror. You can get the hard wire kit on ebay for under $9. I ran the wire all along the edge of the head liner and down behind the pillar moldings directly to the fuse box. Wire it up to the ignition fuse and it will turn of and on with your car. Give it a few days before you decide to return it. It's well worth the money and does the same as my XRS R10G for much much less money.

..

38708104 I recommend a mount for your phone otherwise it's a cumbersome interface and dangerous while driving. But that aside it has detected every cop I've seen using radar or laser, false alerts are about the same as with my other radar detector. Use it enough and you'll figure them out. Good detector in my opinion!

..

38708104 I passed 3 cops after buying this product and I know that 2 were shooting radar. It never once went off. I am taking this back after Thanksgiving.

..

38708104 I purchased this and returned it in less than one day. I drove through a large city and an interstate highway. I passed several police officers, three of which were running radar/laser, a police station, and two highway patrol stations... This thing did not beep once. The only time it beeped was at a hospital due to the automatic doors. Doors opened and this thing beeped. That was it. Nothing else.
It looks nice and sleek, since its all black and has a nice shape, but it doesnt have a screen. It has one big mute button and the volume selector. The voice alerts are not very good either and often hard to hear. You cant select highway or city if you dont have your iphone/ipod with you, and you cant change any of the settings.
Save your money and buy another radar detector. You will regret it and you cannot count on this at all.

..

38708104 I am a huge electronics guru and this is not an impressive radar detector at all. The response of the vehicle speed and radar detection is delayed and the app displays that the device is not connected at times when the bluetooth clearly shows that the device is connected. Returned the same day I purchased.

..

38708104 I just bought this radar detector 2 days ago. Yesterday I was using it and I got a $204 speeding ticket! My first one in 15 years! And this Cobra radar detector was sitting right on my window, COMPLETELY SILENT! It never went off. No sound, no visual. I was a sitting duck. Packing it up and returning it today.

..

38708104 I bought the iRadar because I was intrigued with the idea that i could use my iPhone 4 for one more great application. Set up was easy and the iPhone app was very interactive. That's where it all ends. The iRadar was prone to many false alarms, both rural and urban. My community has the speed warning trailers positioned about to make drivers aware of how fast they are moving as they approach populated areas. The iRadar picked up the trailer about 1/4 mile upon approach. Not acceptable. As for Laser... I travel to CT often, (Laser Radar Heaven!!), and even having the iRadar positioned low on the windshield the iRadar struggled to pick up the laser signal. I was right on top of the police trap when it finally activated. One of the most annoying features of the iRadar and the deal breaker for me is the fact that the D/C power adapter consistently "popped out" of the lighter socket. I notice others have made the same observation in their reviews. Also, having two power cords on your dash is annoying and looks messy. So, bottom line I returned the iRadar to BestBuy and ended up shelling out the big bucks to buy an Escort 9500ix. Let me tell you.... This is the way to go given the fact that one ticket in MA can cost you over $3,000.00in the course of 6 years it remains on your record and jacks up your insurance. So like they say.... you get what you pay for. Take a pass on the iRadar and spend the extra money and buy an Escort!

..

38708104 I was skeptical at first, but once I downloaded the app it was clear that "I just had to have the actual devices ASAP.". I ran out to my local Best Buy picked it up and installed it. I love the display and the very clear messages being displayed (especially those of approaching red lights cameras). If you have an iPhone that is mounted to your dashboard while you drive, throw away your current radar detector and get iRadar and this app.
The iRadar and the app work alongside A2DP auto connections (I.e. you can play your music over you Bluetooth Audio while still receiving both visual and audio alerts). Initially it was a little challenging to get the two things working (thank you Pioneer) but now they work together as soon as I turn the key in the engine.
Get this gadget if you already have or plan to have an iPhone. I saw that they are trying to release an Android app (supposed to have been on 4/4/2011). It'll be okay with an iPad (if you have the roo. For one on your dashboard). If you have an iPod touch... Get an iPhone... The location based alerts will not work (I.e. Red light camera warnings)
A couple things that could be improved:
1. Even with the app "running in the background" the alerts don't show. The physical iRadar sounds only the radar alerts, you won't get the red light and other iDevice based warnings. This will definitely affect those of us who use our iDevices for navigation. 
2. Would be nice to change the music tracks of the playlist I'm currently playing from within the app (as is the case with many of the GpS Navigation out in the market).
3. Integrate Google Traffic in the map view (again so we don't have to switch out of the application to see this information).
4. The power adapter could be more snug in the cig lighter adapter. I tried several and it kept slipping out.

The D-Link Xtreme N Duo USB Adapter (DWA-160) is the latest addition to the award-winning Xtreme N product family. The DWA-160 is designed for users looking to get a reliable wireless connection that can handle High-Definition (HD) video streams throughout the house.


..

38708104 Maybe I just have a bad one, but this adapter is not working after one month. Taking this one back to BB.

..

38708104 This product is great. It installed in about five miinutes, and five minutes after that I was connected to our wireless network and online. It's actually how I'm writting this review right now. The only snag I ran into was during installation, windows refused to install some drivers that were not 'digitally signed'. However, I have not noticed any impact on the performance of this product, and find it's speed completely satisfactory for my online needs, even if it only picks up 72% of the wireless signal (router is ~20 feet away, transmitting through two brick and cinderblock walls).

..

38708104 For someone with limited computer knowledge, this works great for me.

..

38708104 So far I am very happy with the wireless.The price was fair for the value.

..

38708104 Orignally purchased Belkin N+ adapter to connect my VIsta 64 PC wirelessly to my DLINK 628 Dual Band N Router. That did not work at all so returned and purchased this adapter. Setup was pretty easy although it took a couple of tries to connect to the router, more my problem than the adapter. Connection now is 5x5 (adapter is located close to the router so I can't speak to connection from a distance or thru walls. Internet response is same as when PC was directly connected to router with ethernet. Also wireless printer is working fine with no drop off in response or printer speed (again located close to router).

..

38708104 D-Link Tech Support advised me to upgrade to the DWA-160, but the unit won't connect. They claim it doesn't support Windows 7, but my laptop is running XP and I couldn't get any love there either.

..

38708104 Heres a usb i like, flawless design, color that stands out, too bad it can break and doesnt work aswell as N sopose too.

..

38708104 I bought the D-Link - Xtreme N Wireless-N Gigabit Router and was not satisfied with a wall connection though the electrical outlet.. But I bought this and, well, i was blown away with its speed. The dual band part helps a lot when someones playing a game, and someone is just web browsing. It took me about 3-5 min to set it up. You can download faster with this.

..

38708104 Easy to install, just switched from linksys and the difference is outstanding. Works great!

..

38708104 whilst signal strength is good and performance also good "when it is connected", I find the product disconnects too often (compared for example with the wirelss N adapter built into my macbook; which does not disconnect at all when running on the same network!).
on my desktop I am running multiple separate user profiles and switching between profiles (annoyingly) drops the WLAN connection to the router. My previous wirelss-G adapter never did this. Also, when the connection drops, it takes some time trying to re-connect to the network.
Would definitely recommend thinking twice before buying this adapter. I certainly wouldn't purchase it again.

..

38708104 I got it on clearance sale. I have a similar one from D-link and I use it daily. The set up is a bit complicated and requires some research. It takes okay pictures, but unfortunately, it doesn't capture any videos. And, there is no night vision. Other than that, it is a decent camera for the price I paid.

..

38708104 I got this on clearance for $20 and it was worth every penny. I would have picked up more if they had been in stock.

..

38708104 The camera was pretty simple and easy to setup. It is useless when it's a bit dark, all you see is pitch black; only use this camera in a lighted area.

..

38708104 I like the product and has added to the security of our home.

..

38708104 I bought this camera for remote viewing and it works great, but I exchanged it for the next model which included that feature.

..

38708104 The camera is useful during the day only. You need to use a light during the night, or get the more expensive camera. Only issue I can complain about is how many times we have to reset it up. It. The power goes off, if the network glitches from a storm you have to reset everything up again.

..

38708104 Good camera for the price , average picture quality, but seams to be working just fine.

..

38708104 It's a great surveillance camera, to keep your house safe.

..

38708104 I bought this camera to keep an eye on my three dogs when we are not home. I wanted to see which one was the culprit at getting in to things. It does have an easy set up (though first one I purchased was defective) and you can monitor with a PC, Iphone or Android phone which is great. It works great when it works, it tends to go offline all the time and you can not fix that remotely you have to run the setup wizard to get back online. I would recommend the camera as long as the buyer was aware of it's issues.

..

38708104 I am very happy with this for a first time camera. I am able to capture every image that I want.

Easy-to-use, reliable and affordable monochrome laser printersPerfect for small and home offices and small businessesGet outstanding value and reliability with the compact Dell B1160 and wireless B1160w printers. Affordably priced, both printers deliver excellent print quality at a low cost per page, fast print speeds and a high monthly duty cycle. Easy-to-use and maintain, they come with a lifetime fuser unit, so the only part to install is the single toner cartridge.


..

38708104 I received it very quickly from pcrush. It did not work it would buzz really loudly and not feed any paper. Pcrush is a 3rd party seller and it took awhile for the warranty registration to be updated on the dell site. Mine had a rapid exchange warranty which is nice however the exchange that was sent was a refurbished unit. It looks brand new and works great and for the price paid it was a steal. Still only four stars since the one received was junk.

..

38708104 I was able to install easily and without any problems...advised my friend to get it and it was sold out...great deal

Control up to 4 A/V components with this DISH Network DISH211 universal remote that features IR and UHF operation for flexible use. Backlit active mode keys provide a highly visible design and provide one-touch control.


..

38708104 Bought a couple when on sale at a better price than through Dish. (two for the price of one) Seems to be the same remote as supplied by Dish and works just fine with my VIP722k.
I can lose this remote just the same as the one I lost and replaced. Glad I bought two.

..

38708104 This is a good replacement remote for your Dish receivers. Was able to program it without any problems.

..

38708104 We had worn the old remote out. Took me about 3 minutes to set this one up and we were back in business.

..

38708104 It works great with our TV. Wasn't to bad getting it to sync.

..

38708104 It is a very reasonable remote and works fine. You need a code for your TV so the remote will work. The people at Dish can help you with that. This remote is exactly like Dish's one, and maybe even better and it is available in the store.

..

38708104 Very good product
Easy to setup
Easy to use on all brands of equipment

..

38708104 Works just like the original remote. Easy to program. I like it so much I bought two.

..

38708104 All good, better than original and had good instructions.
It would be better with lighted controls.

..

38708104 Best remote. Very easy to use. And also works with tv dish receiver, dvd and more. Very handy and got it at a very cheap price at best buy. I highly recommend this remote to all

..

38708104 We have several dish systems in the house and a few dogs to. When one of the dogs chews up the remotes, we can easily get another to work just as designed.

Griffin Survivor iPad Case - iPad - Black - Silicone, Polycarbonate


..

38708104 I am very pleased with this case. No issues with it so far and it does as intended, which is protect my ipad. Stylsh color as well.

..

38708104 Really bulky, camera lens was cover at all times, bought another cover.

..

38708104 I think the product does what it is meant to do, though I haven't dropped or wet my iPad yet. The clip is relatively easy to come off and I already lost it. Also it is rather difficult to open the clip into standing position.

..

38708104 Works great got a great price very happy! Survived a vacation in the car over 5000 miles

..

38708104 Overall, i'm happy with the purchase, the case it tough, easy to hold, protects the ipad well enough, but the fit isn't perfect. When snapping the device in, one corner of the case wouldn't completely latch on, leaving a bit of give when you apply pressure. If dropped specifically in this spot, the give my lead to damage, but overall its very secure. If you don't mind it not being a perfect fit, for the price, it does the job.

..

38708104 I would definitely recommend this case to a friend. It's durable and long lasting.

..

38708104 Very good product if your looking for a strong way to protect an expensive investment and extend the lifespan of the ipad. It is easy to assemble and provides good strong cover that enables the ipad to be taken almost anywhere with minimal risk to damaging the product. Very good investmetn from a company that makes some of the best protective cases for the iphone.

..

38708104 I liked the looks of this product but it did not fit into the purse I carry my I pad in.

..

38708104 Protects the ipad very well especially from messy kids hands. Just wipe it off and is like new. Also protects from falls. Feels sturdy enough to absorb shocks but is comfortable to hold onto

..

38708104 After my kids dropped our 4th generation iPad onto our hard tile floors for the 3rd time in 14 months (each time meant a new screen...thank goodness I had a protection plan) I finally decided to get some protection. This unit appealed to my younger girls (pink) and to me because of its Military Grade Rating. Still not water proof...but water resistant. Shock durability was a big plus for me. I made a video review of this item. Check it out. Although this product wasn't as rigid as I hoped, it does seem to offer solid protection. Recommend.

Charge or sync your iPad, iPhone, or iPod with more freedom to move around.Our USB-to-Dock-Connector cable is almost 10 feet long and built with heavy-duty 20-gauge conductors to handle the 10 watt power needs of Apple's iPad. Connect this cable to your computer's USB port to sync your iPad, iPod, or iPhone; or to any 10 watt USB power source (we suggest our own PowerBlock or PowerJolt) and charge from 10 feet away.


..

38708104 I bought 1 unit a year ago in Best Buy, but cant find it any more on stores (or cant buy it in Brazil for shipping to a Best Buy store (to be collected during a travel). Like too much this cable that would buy another 2 or 3 units, if I found them....

..

38708104 This is a terrible cable. Doesn't matter what it is connected: iPad 2, iPhone 4s, iPod...it either won't seat correctly or it will but only for a short time. Taking it back to the store ASAP.
My recommendation? Don't waste your money on this cable.

..

38708104 Only long cable I found heavy duty enough to carry the full 10 watts needed to charge an iPad. Standard USB extenders will not do it. The adapter end is very thick and well made; fine for the iPad and its various cases. I do have a problem charging my iPhone; the adapter end is too thick to snugly plug into the iPhone with the current case that I'm using.

HP X4000b Bluetooth Mouse - Wireless - Bluetooth - 1600 dpi


..

38708104 I really like this mouse, the bluetooth option to connect is great not having to have a usb dongle plugged in all the time

..

38708104 Works as advertised. Needed a mouse for my tablet and this does the trick.

..

38708104 This is my first bluetooth mouse, and for most similar mice, the user reviews complain about dropped connections happening on a regular basis - and accepted as just the price you pay for saving a USB port.
Well this mouse paired up with my laptop with no problem and I have seen not a single dropped connection in about 3 weeks of use. Laptop is a Macbook, running Windows 7 mostly.
Battery life: can't really comment yet - I haven't had to change batteries. But I do tend to switch off the power when I'm not using it, as I do with all non-wired mice. When switching back on, it connects back up again in under a second.
Comfort: I think I have average size adult male hands, but I find many mice too small and give me hand cramp. Not this one, good size and shape.

..

38708104 I used this with my bluetooth keyboard and my Samsung Pro Tab and was pleasantly surprised. More convenient than a laptop.

..

38708104 Handles well and feels great to the fingers! Easy to connect via bluetooth. Awesome purchase!

..

38708104 PERFECT FOR THE JOB.
IT GETS THE JOB DONE WITH EASE

..

38708104 I bought this out of necessity, but happened to be 50% off which was a great price.

..

38708104 Great bluetooth mouse, it paired quickly, worked on almost any surface and can be used with either hand. Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a bluetooth mouse.

..

38708104 This mouse is great for connecting to a tablet that does not have a USB port. It integrates smoothly and works perfectly with my venue 8.

..

38708104 I bought this mouse after looking at various bluetooth mice from other brands which were way too expensive. This was not only affordable, was really easy to setup on my Mac and works great and runs smoothly.

..

38708104 I purchased this printer to replace a older one. Took it out of the box and the power cord and ink cartridge were missing. Ended up returning it to the store. For the price it seemed like a decent printer.

..

38708104 It prints and I'm not running out of ink after 10 printed pages. XL HP cartridge is a winner.

..

38708104 Great little printer. Works better than the $400 one in my office at work. Would buy again.

..

38708104 The software is easy to use. The wireless functionality is convenient. I haven't had any ink issues yet.

..

38708104 For the price, the printer is of good quality and reliable. The only issues experienced with the printer are ones similar to ones had with other HP printers, such as constant waste of paper and ink with alignments, ink cartridge replacements, etc.

..

38708104 great value for price. lightweight, easy to move from room to room.

..

38708104 A good printer for the price. The software cd to set it up was blank but customer service quickly set it up for me online.

..

38708104 Printer prints well at a good speed. Love the wireless capability. Prints quickly. Good color.

..

38708104 Great product for the price ($40) during Thanksgiving sale. The only problem is I hear a scratching noise when the scanner is working at a specific point. Other than that, its a great product!

..

38708104 I bought this because I needed something for my home office, however upon arrival, it wont connect wirelessly to my computer meaning I have to constantly have it connected via USB. Besides that, it prints well, good colour and all.

..

The slim-yet-sturdy iPad Smart Case protects your iPad screen and its aluminum back. So your iPad is fully covered on all sides. And colorful too.


..

38708104 Apple had a real chance to make something that would perfectly fit their own product and somewhere along the way they fell short.
The backing on the case looks like it would be padded in some way but don't be fooled it offers nothing in the way of damage prevention.
The edges that surround the case create an unneccesarily large lip that become extremely uncomfortable when using for extended periods of time. Why they didn't create a smooth contour like just about every other case on the market is a real head scratcher.
The biggest oversight is the lack of a simple row of magnets across the back edge of the case so that you could flip over the Smart Cover and have it attach securely and not flop around. With all the "magnet technology" in the iPad itself and how it functions with the Smart Cover why wouldn't they stay on par with Belkin, Speck and several others?
Bottom Line: There are simply way better options out there for far less than the $50 Apple is asking for this product.

..

38708104 This ipad cover was by far the best purchase I could have made.

..

38708104 This case is awesome. We had the first case for over 2 years and was starting ti show wear and worn out so we decided to buy the same case. I would buy this again!

..

38708104 this is a great case if you don't have little kids and you are very carful handling expensive items of technology. Slim light weight and you don't have to power off your device just close the cover part of the case and puts your device to sleep and you can fold up in different positions for when you want to use it on a table.

..

38708104 Love this iPad cover! Looks nice and protects my iPad. Really love the dark gray color

..

38708104 what a great case for cases and its just in case.!

..

38708104 This is high quality product from Apple and you're going to pay a bit for the name brand (as usual). Not to take anything away from the case itself, because it's very nice, with a nice snug fit around the device, and the auto-lock function when you close the case. Because the weight of the iPad, though, when you try to stand it up on the folded over cover, it's a bit flimsy. Other than that, I would definitely recommend it.

..

38708104 Good product made with quality materials. Slim forms keeps in line with slim form of iPad. The magnetic portion holds well, but may scuff up iPad surface after long use.

..

38708104 This cover attaches to the iPad easily & closes snug against the iPad to protect the glass and put the iPad in sleep mode. I unfortunately spilled coffee on mine within the first week & it absorbed into the leather quickly. If you're prone to accidents like me you may want to go with the vinyl cover.

..

38708104 The case is reasonably priced and works as intended. It shuts off the iPad when closed and turns it back on when opening. Would recommend it.

The edges that surround the case create an unneccesarily large lip that become extremely uncomfortable when using for extended periods of time. Why they didn't create a smooth contour like just about every other case on the market is a real head scratcher.
The biggest oversight is the lack of a simple row of magnets across the back edge of the case so that you could flip over the Smart Cover and have it attach securely and not flop around. With all the "magnet technology" in the iPad itself and how it functions with the Smart Cover why wouldn't they stay on par with Belkin, Speck and several others?
Bottom Line: There are simply way better options out there for far less than the $50 Apple is asking for this product.

38708104 This ipad cover was by far the best purchase I could have made.

..

38708104 This case is awesome. We had the first case for over 2 years and was starting ti show wear and worn out so we decided to buy the same case. I would buy this again!

..

38708104 this is a great case if you don't have little kids and you are very carful handling expensive items of technology. Slim light weight and you don't have to power off your device just close the cover part of the case and puts your device to sleep and you can fold up in different positions for when you want to use it on a table.

..

38708104 Love this iPad cover! Looks nice and protects my iPad. Really love the dark gray color

..

38708104 what a great case for cases and its just in case.!

..

38708104 This is high quality product from Apple and you're going to pay a bit for the name brand (as usual). Not to take anything away from the case itself, because it's very nice, with a nice snug fit around the device, and the auto-lock function when you close the case. Because the weight of the iPad, though, when you try to stand it up on the folded over cover, it's a bit flimsy. Other than that, I would definitely recommend it.

..

38708104 Good product made with quality materials. Slim forms keeps in line with slim form of iPad. The magnetic portion holds well, but may scuff up iPad surface after long use.

..

38708104 This cover attaches to the iPad easily & closes snug against the iPad to protect the glass and put the iPad in sleep mode. I unfortunately spilled coffee on mine within the first week & it absorbed into the leather quickly. If you're prone to accidents like me you may want to go with the vinyl cover.

..

38708104 The case is reasonably priced and works as intended. It shuts off the iPad when closed and turns it back on when opening. Would recommend it.

So much more than a case, the Smart Cover was designed alongside iPad 2 to be its perfect match: a thin, durable cover that magnetically aligns for a perfect fit. It automatically wakes and sleeps your iPad. It's a handy stand for reading, watching, and typing. Its microfiber lining keeps your iPad screen clean. And it's a way to make your iPad as personal on the outside as it is on the inside.

..

38708104 I thought this was the one!!
I have tiny ears, so finding an affordable bluetooth to use with my phone, that could also play music has been difficult.
The style of the earpiece makes it very comfortable, and the hook keeps it in place without trying to shove it in my ear. It's very lightweight and, once in place, you forget it's there.
I tested it on the first day ... sound quality on calls was great.
But when I tried to listen to a book from my phone, I could not get more than a few feet away without the sound cutting out. I've had other bluetooths that I'd forget where my phone was because I wandered away while talking or listening to music.
I could not leave the room with Jabra EasyGo. :(
My search continues

..

38708104 I work in a fast paced hectic environment, and I have damaged or lost several Blue Tooth ears b4. This unit works and sounds good, sets up in less than a minute with my LG phone, and I do not have to worry if I smash it or loose it while working because the price is low. Sound quality from both ends is above average, but not excellent. I find it very comfortable, even forgetting it is there after a while.

38708104 I've waited 30 years to buy new speakers, and I'm glad I waited for these. Powered speakers have their own internal amp, and JBL utilizes some of the best. The sound is crisp and STRONG. We had a DJ who was drooling over these speakers at our last party, and I'd recommend them strongly.

Great company to work with - Thank you

..

38708104 I had it installed in my van and instantly became a big fan of it! The audio was great and the fact that I could watch movies with it and things on the Internet is awesome. With this piece, my radio has a whole new life to it.

..

38708104 Did not play videos at at!...I think it needs a specific ipod o iphone

..

38708104 Overall, it is a fine idea. I would like to see in indash or plate mount to make it more accessible and clean. It does not seem to me like it does what it boasts. I can't fully control my Iphone with it nor see video. Unless I am doing something wrong, I think a simple USB would suffice. Only recommend if you like to see a still picture of the artist if it';s available.

..

38708104 I bought this cable to use in my Acura Integra. Install was easy. All I had to do was make sure the AV input was set to iPod and I was good to go. Only thing I would change would be to make it just a little bit longer, otherwise, it would get 5 stars.

..

38708104 I purchase the JVC KW-AV60BT stereo for my 2006 Toyota Pre-Runner Truck. The radio is excellent. I also purchased the optional cable to display videos from my iPhone. However, this cable did not work with my iPhone 4s. Could not get it to work at all (no audio or video). The radio would not recognize my iPhone. The radio would play my music from my iPhone when i pluged in my apple USB cable with no problem. I call JVC tech support and they said the the cable (JVC KS-U30) might be defective. They said that if the cable was working correctly, the radio would immediately recognize the iPhone as soon has it was pluged in. Sorry , but I did not have a good experience with this cable. I will return it back to Bestbuy...

38708104 I really like the form factor and the general performance of the Twist. It's very portable with a decent screen size (12.5" - 11" that some other convertibles have is too small for regular laptop work). I like Windows 8 and the metro start screen/tiles. I wish all my programs could be run without utilizing the desktop, but since I have older Windows programs it's very useful to be able to use them on a convertible machine. Overall very happy.

38708104 I bought this laptop because of the cool feature of turning into a tablet so I can watch movies on my flights for work. Well after doing one of the many suggested Windows and Lenovo's upgrades, I ended up losing access to my mini Hdmi port on my laptop. I looked up this issue online and Lenovo has this issue as a recorded issue with them at this time. Since I've owned this laptop for a few months, it has gone thru multiple factory settings restores and currently as I type this is back at Lenovo warranty department for repair work.

..

38708104 I had upgraded to the I7 core and 500 GB hard disk. I was working at my desk (not even plugged in, so no power surge) when the machine flickered and went black. I could not even get it to power back up (nor could the excellent people at the repair shop). Now I'm hoping they can recover my data. It was very nice while it was working, but what isn't.

Lexar 4GB Platinum II Memory Stick PRO Duo Card - 4 GB


..

38708104 I searched everywhere for this item from amazon to ebay, and this was the best "safe" deal I could find! I recently bought a psp for my younger brother and he needed a memory stick duo. I quickly found out that they're actually quite expensive. So I looked all over until I found this delicious little morsel!

..

38708104 I had a hard time finding this memory stick in local stores and when I did they were way overpriced, in my opinion. Then I found it on line and at a terrific low price. It works great, picture quality is comparable to the name brand. I'm very happy with my purchase.

38708104 I love the item and it helps us out getting all of our electronics connected to the internet

..

38708104 If you're a single person this is a great device, but if you have a large volume of data consumers I'd go with a dual band router.

..

38708104 While the range and operation of this router is fine, connecting it to the laptop was a chore. Unless you're tech savvy it takes a certain amount of intuition to complete the connection.

..

38708104 I bought this router back at the beginning of 2009 and its been great!
i have had it for almost five years! but now the connection s getting slow. but isntt it fear after five years!! but still although its technology is not "the latest" still worth buying!!
to make it short am buying it again! provided me with great connection for
my ps3 over the years :)

..

38708104 These routers are excellent. just plug and go..would buy another one

..

38708104 I bought the router at my son's urging...I went on line and picked it out and sent photo to him...H3 said.."Mom, buy it, is the same one I have....what a coincidence...

..

38708104 Though not an IT pro, I know several and so asked them for recommendations. They said this was "the DC3 of wireless routers" and still more than up to my limited needs: mostly email and web browsing (no gaming, streaming video, etc.). It's apparently been around for years and has a great rep --- was once the benchmark, I gather. Has therefore both the pros and cons of older tried&true products: Nothing new and fancy, but all the bugs are long since gone, it's simple to set up b/c it is pretty basic, tech support types tend to know it and know what to do when you call with questions, etc. On the other hand, it's not as fast and so forth as the newer stuff, will get only more obsolete sooner than the newer models, and so forth. In short, it works fine for me for now, just as my friends told me. And it should be OK for a good while longer, I figure.

..

38708104 I've been using this router in my home for years and it is still running as good as it was on day 1. It's not an N router, but that shouldn't make a big difference to most people. It is DD-WRT compatible. Great as a primary router or a secondary access point. I have mine in my basement and can get a good signal in my bedroom.

..

38708104 A good product for the home. The price was very good

..

38708104 I was a little concerned with the price compared to the last one I had. I was very surprised how much better it worked. Was defiantly worth the price.

Multiple MIMO (multiple input, multiple output) antennas extend your router's wireless coverage into hard-to-reach areas of your home.


..

38708104 I'm very disappointed with this router. I was having trouble with it since the first day. Their customer service is horrible! 1 year warranty is only on hardware. software is not covered. they told me the model I got needs software upgrade which is not covered! Mine goes to trash!!!!

..

38708104 My house is big enough that the signal was very weak upstairs when my wireless router was in the office on one side of the first floor. The signal was strong at the top of the steps outside the room where the router was, but as you went down the hall, the signal decreased. I searched online a little but I saw many mixed reviews and conflicting statements for what exactly I would need to extend my network. I wanted a simple, inexpensive solution, and i wanted to make sure it worked. I ended up just asking someone in the store. I explained the situation and the router I was working with and this is what they suggested.
The setup was a little harder than expected (I probably should have read the instructions first). It needs to be set up near the wireless router originally, and once it picks up the signal it can be unplugged and moved somewhere else. It will actually boost, and extend the network where ever it is placed.
It has a wall plug attached, which can be removed in favor of a cord, depending on where it will be placed.

..

38708104 Performs as stated. Works great on patio and porch.

..

38708104 This product does what it says, "Increases your network coverage" and thats about it. In my scenario it gave me the full signal in other parts of the house where I needed it but made the network very slow and unstable. My devices have better performance from less signal out of the main WiFi router than with the range extender. So the good is: you get a great signal but the bad: you lose performance. Makes the connected devices good for only light web browsing.

..

38708104 Installed in less than 10 minutes. Compatible with existing Wi Fi Router, Motorola SBG6580 with TWC. Have not experienced any signal drops. Just make sure you set up your existing router in a location that picks up the strongest signal, that way the expander will replicate a better signal. Both router & expander survived a recent thunderstorm & power outage, Thankfully!

..

38708104 I work in IT and have worked in this career field for over 20 years. I bought one of these a few years ago (802.1g model) and it didn't work then. I figured over the years they probably fixed the problems. The device is pretty easy to set up but you can't really make any changes unless you can connect the device to your current (linksys) router. If that router is secured it creates more problems.
When it's finally hooked up my computers close by would connect to it, But then it would drop connections, restart it self, take a long time to wake up, It was totally frustrating and not worth the money. I might pay $5 bucks for it but not $90.
Someone suggested to get a different brand so I'm going to try that one out.

..

38708104 It was very easy to set up. The only difficulty was that I didn't have all my windows updates installed, and I had to make sure that a specific one was done before installing this product. That installation took forever, but once that was done, the installation of the extender went extremely rapidly! The only very small issue was that I had to move the extender closer to my router in order to get the most bars of service. It now works like a charm! We have wireless service in the farthest reaches of our relatively large home. I highly recommend it.

..

38708104 I purchased this range extender along with a new dual band router to facilitate simultaneous video streaming from Netflix and online gaming. I was able to connect a network cable from the BluRay DVD player to this unit which then connects to the rest of the network wirelessly. It worked as advertised and really helped my network's performance.

..

38708104 My goal was to improve the wireless signal through out my home. My primary access point is on the second floor and I needed stronger coverage in the lower level (basement) to be able to use wireless devices there and on the exterior of the building. I wanted to stay with the same manufacture (Cisco, Linksys) and have simple set up and compatibility. The set up was a breeze and took less than 10 min from start to finish. It has improved signal at my access point in the lower level (approx.200ft) from poor to sometimes zero signal to 50-90%. Now I can maintain signal for Internet and printing.Great choice and did not cost a huge investment

..

38708104 After installing, re-installing and performing various adjustments, this product worsened all connections to my wi-fi network. My internet-enabled Blu-ray DVD player performed much worse with the Extender installed, dropping the connection during streamed video roughly once a minute and reducing video quality. And the overall range of the wi-fi network was reduced, not increased, and it was slower.
I was able to return this product to Best Buy for a full refund, which was the only good part of my experience with it.

..

38708104 the distortion happens at high to max volume and very horrible bass response and I`ve had mine for 1 year

..

38708104 I got these a long time ago, they're get-what-you-pay-for speakers. Don't expect the best quality from these. If you don't want fancy expensive speakers, these will do just fine. They do get some static backdrop sometimes, but this is a recent issue that didn't happen before. I would NOT recommend these to a sound artist/ musician. They work OKAY, but for a few dollars more you can have much better speakers.

..

38708104 theese are speakers. they are just speakers nothing else. they dont add extra such as bass. so the sound quality is terrible. also when you turn it up (max volume) the quality is terrible and it not that loud. also they are NOT clear. when you hear drums you hear a crackling noise.

the design is terrible. they barrley stand up by themselves. mainley because all the weight is in the back. also 1 speaker has the weight of a rock and the other one feels like foam. also the wires are power wire is to short.

overall they just do their jobs. nothing more. if you decide to get theese speakers i warned you. but if you want speakers get some HP speakers. http://bit.ly/kXfKW1

..

38708104 Don't buy them, I got these free with a keyboard that I got and they suck. I got them for FREE and I would never pay 12 bucks for them. Don't waste your money.

With 103 washable, laser-printed and UV-coated keys, this Logitech K310 920-004033 USB keyboard provides reliable durability for frequent use. The 12 shortcut hot keys and multimedia keys provide simple access to frequently used functions.


..

38708104 I ordered this keyboard on 11/29/13 with 2 day shipping, the item was in stock at IT Wholesalers. The keyboard arrived on 12/12/13 via USPS, well outside of a 2 day timeframe.
The keyboard had no documentation included with it, no warranty information, nothing. It was wrapped in bubble wrap loosely in a brown cardboard shipping box.
The vendor blacked out the serial number under the keyboard with a permanent black marker. As a result, I'm unable to register for the 3-year included warranty.
The keyboard itself is plug and play; there are icons underneath showing the cleaning procedure and tolerances of the keyboard. Keypress is quiet and soft, and responsive. No software is needed from Logitech. The FN key and included functions (volume, calculator, etc) are quick and responsive. Overall, the keyboard itself is very nice; but if you can buy it from someone other than IT Wholesalers, please do.

..

38708104 This is a nice inexpensive keyboard that is pretty durable and you don't have to worry about spills!
I use it with my laptop when I'm at home and not near my docking station. It's a great size for this purpose although not ergonomically designed.

..

38708104 Easy to setup and use (on Windows 7).
A chiclet kind feeling is great to have on a desktop keyboard.
Poured water on it and was functional after just shaking it to remove water from its surface.

..

38708104 what a cool little keyboard! I've been taking it with me on job sites as frequently as possible to get it dirty so I can clean it! got a deal at best buy... only $15. better price than most other physical and/or online stores. if you are in the market for a washable keyboard, give it a try... you can always return it after a few days if you dislike it.

38708104 No complaints with this keyboard. Great for my kid that eats at the computer. Easy clean up and set up.

38708104 The keyboard functions as advertised, resisting spills and being far easier to type on than most waterproof keyboards. Still, they keys felt a bit stiff and I found that the spacing was awkward for my fingers, resulting in more typos.
Ended it up abandoning it and going back to my laptop keyboard but highly recommend for desktop PCs for people who are clumsy and routinely ruin keyboards.

..

38708104 I needed a new keyboard and couldn't believe the price on this one. Easy to hook up and works great!

..

38708104 I can see the letters clearly even in low light. The online order and instore pick-up process was easy.

..

38708104 Just love it. Using it for coding and playing games.

..

38708104 Too many keyboards are all dark. I can see the letters clearly. Even in low light.

Ultrathin Keyboard Cover protects your keyboard in style and it's the perfect partner for your iPad. The stylish, ultra-thin aluminum screen cover feels great and looks even better. Instant on/off automatically wakes your iPad when you open the cover and sends it to sleep when you close it. When it's time to write an IM or email, you'll enjoy typing on the included Bluetooth wireless keyboard. The external keyboard not only frees up screen space on your iPad, it also allows you to work faster by using shortcuts for the commands you use most often, such as copy, paste, undo and many more. Battery life for the keyboard lasts six months on full charge. Securely attach the cover with its clever magnetic clip. Aligned with the magnets built into your iPad's frame, the clip draws tablets and cover irresistibly together. Cover works with iPad 2 and iPad (third generation) and includes the Bluetooth wireless keyboard, stand, USB to micro USB charging cable and cleaning cloth.


..

38708104 It is an alright keyboard, I guess the Ipad was not meant to have a keyboard, is hard to remember new commands and not having a mouse makes it a little hard to get used to.

..

38708104 Bought for my wife to use for her personal use. She loves the fact that she doesnt have to hold the ipad upright anymore while on the table.

..

38708104 Didn't fit new iPad Air. Exchanged. Got a different one.

..

38708104 i like that this is a slim cover as well as a great stand with the convenience of a keyboard. it is very easy to "take along" and put into bag without the bulk

..

38708104 I would recommend this set up to anyone. It is easy to use and does the job without any hassles

..

38708104 Only issue is there is no protection for ipad
When they are separated. Not a problem for some. I need something. Bought fabric skin
With rubber case instead.

..

38708104 Great keyboard really light. Easy to install and easy to used.

..

38708104 My family enjoys using this for things like e-mails and web forms.

..

38708104 It was easy to connect and portable, kinda like a cover for the face

..

38708104 I love this keyboard. Battery last a long time. Easy to attach and remove. Very easy to type on.

..

38708104 One of the thumb buttons broke (G6 button), weakens overtime. It is plastic so I guess it is expected. Logitech needs to strengthen these thumb buttons. Sucks because this was a common button that I used in everyday gaming.

..

38708104 Find out what is useful to you and program the buttons to make it easy! Copy and paste? Easy! Need a more complicated keystroke pattern? You can do that too! To monitor my site, I use keystroke navigation. Thanks again, Logitec!

..

38708104 I have the G500, G300, and now the G700 mouse (I purchased in that order over 2 years).
G500
PROS - good quality switches, good optical sensor
CONS - only 1 profile, poor software: terrible interface, game-recognizing mouse profiles did not work reliably and required inconvenient workarounds (manually editing XML files, ALT-tabbing in and out of games and restarting Logitech Set Point software )
G300 (my favorite of all 3)
PROS - great quality buttons and switches, 3 profiles with easily-identifiable color lights on the sides (not annoying), great software
CONS - low DPI optical sensor (it's sadly not a laser sensor)
G700
PROS - 5 profiles, several buttons, it can work wired OR wireless
CONS -
1) Very, very poor quality buttons and switches. I returned the first mouse I bought because several of the buttons didn't work or got stuck: G10 button, left/right scroll switches. Also, some of the buttons feel vague and provide no confidence to use rapidly.
2) Logitech Set Point software is terrible. With the last few revisions of the driver that gets saved to the mouse, the mouse would forget its profile settings after a few hours... while in use! The only solution right now it to use much older Set Point software with a horrible interface but at least the mouse is usable.
3) The included micro USB cable is way too heavy to use. I am using a much lighter one that I got with an external HDD.

..

38708104 Ergonomics on this mouse are only so-so -- otherwise this is a great mouse at a good price.

..

38708104 Well to start off I come from the experience of using the previous version call the Logitech G7.
The main changes are:
- Single rechargeable battery
- can be run wireless and wired
- mouse wheel can run in 2 modes
- 6 additional buttons
- more durable, non-slip surface
- can be run more than a full day's work on the power saver setting
Cons:
- battery meter display is not accurate
- cable to run wired and charge the mouse is stiff
- many of extra buttons are not standardized so you need to manually set each button within the mouse software

..

38708104 This product is easy to install and well worth the price.

..

38708104 This mouse is a good mouse for its price. I am excited to use it but one complaint will be the software that is downloaded to be able to assign keys. it is not as easy friendly as i was hoping for like razor products. battery life lasts about a day. shorter if continuos use. but button placement is great. Can easily access them wothout much delay. Overall, satisfied with the product.

..

38708104 This mouse is really good for gaming, but you still need to charge it a lot.

..

38708104 This is my second G700 mouse. My mice get a lot of use. The G700 fits well in my hand. It is a bit smaller than the MX Revoolution that I had been using. The smaller size fits my hand better and makes it feel as if I have more control. Both left and right sides of the G700 have a nice well textured rubber grip to them that prevents slipping. Buttons are all well within reach of my fingers without having to reposition my hand. This is certainly a good thing while gaming. Tracking is superb and is scalable through the software, and through the buttons located on the mouse. The buttons are programmable to do what you need them to do. Logitech has added support and preprogrammed functions for the most popular games.
One feature I like a lot is the ability to use this mouse either as a corded or cordless config. Honestly I never liked corded mice. I hated the cord getting tugged and having to yank on the mouse to free the cord. Some people say that cordless mice suffer from comm lag and that can mean the difference between being alive or dead in a game. I have never seemed to notice one way or the other. Since the first purchase of my first G700 I have oddly always went corded, but it is nice to know that if I forget my cord when I go somewhere I can always use it cordless.
You really cannot go wrong buying this mouse.

..

38708104 I gave this a 3 Star with the only thing driving the rating down being an apparent quality issue with the primary click buttons. I am writing this review after going through a second G700. The first lasted 6 months and the second 4 months.
What happens is the primary left click button does not stay engaged reliably when pressed. Thus, if you are trying to click drag, the button will disengage and re-engage while you are holding it down. You can search the web for G700 button problem and find a farily lengthy thread with many people experiencing this problem.
Now beyond that ... it is hands down the best mouse I ever used. The 4 side button design is awsome and most importantly those buttons are easy to use. The buttons on the top are laid out perfect and shaped such that its easy to find the buttons you want. I really loved this mouse and Logitech is sending me replacements for both of my defective ones so Kudo's to them for that. But I can't buy another one of these unless I see them acknowledge the issue and report its fixed. Sigh ... I really loved this mouse.

Play music on the go with this Logitech UE wireless speaker that features 2 full-range drivers that deliver pure and rich sound. A built-in microphone lets you make hands-free phone calls using a Bluetooth-enabled device.


..

38708104 I was looking for a small portable speaker for play out in the yard and to take on trips. The Logitech - UE Mobile Boombox is perfect, nice deep bass, clean full sound, not flat sounding like others I have tried. Bluetooth range is very good, it started skipping on me at 50 feet.
YES the dimensions in the specifications are wrong... 2.5"H x 2.5"D x 4.5"W is what I measured

..

38708104 Easy to use-love that you can sync more than one device-small and durable with great sound. Couldn't be happier especially since I didn't have to spend a fortune to get quality.

..

38708104 Small. Powerful. Simple. Unless you need really big sound this is great for backyard and anywhere you need some music. Great value and well built.

..

38708104 I like the little square thing. The Ue 984 sound great and I have gotten it for my wife. When she is in the spare bedroom it is loud and clear. I can hear it down stairs and understand the lyrics. I went to Best buy to find a Bluetooth speaker small enough to fit in her small purse. I have the JBL charge and my opinion it's the best one at best buy. So I had the chance to test all of the Bluetooth by pairing them up with my smart phone. I decided to get the UE 984 Logitech because of it size, sound,10 hour battery life, and it was the only one in its price range that outperformed with max volume and clarity.

..

38708104 I started looking for a Bluetooth speaker after looking at the Jambox. I could believe the sound coming out of that little box. The next day i started looking at reviews on line and at YouTube. This little unit kept popping up in most of the top 5 players. To me sound quality and volume were the biggest things to look at and then i saw a YouTube video of the UE and realized that portability is also a key factor. this player though it plays loud and clear is not the loudest and doesn't have the top bass, but it sounds great and has a good balanced sound with bass and treble. The UE is loud enough for small to medium rooms and i was able to get a good 60 foot line of sight signal without drops !! that's important to me.
Its not Bose or Sonos but it is amazing and great for camping, fishing, hiking or just hanging around the house. easy to use and easy to carry. I can charge it with my android phone charger, don't even need the charger that came with it.

..

38708104 I bought this speaker online based on the specifications about a month ago and Best Buy still has not corrected the ad. I was surprised when I went to pick it up. This speaker is no where near the size advertised. The ad says Height: 8 inches, Width: 15 inches and Depth: 4 inches. Wrong. This speaker is about 4 inches wide 3 inches high and 5 inches deep. Best Buy credited my account for a refund except they charged me $10 and said the promotional $10 gift card had already been sent. I'm amazed they are still advertising the incorrect size.

..

38708104 I purchased this for my husband this Christmas. I read all the reviews and found more recommendations for this one. They were right. It never breaks up, is highly portable and can have multiple users...and sounds great. Long battery life too.

..

38708104 I searched all around my local Best Buy Store because I thought it was much bigger than it was. When I finally asked a sales associate, and was pointed in the right direction, I was shocked. It's very small! I was skeptical of the quality to say the least.
When I got it home, and unboxed it, I was playing music in less than 5 minutes! Set up is a breeze.
It has great range, and bass for such a small device. It sounds great!
It's not going to sound as good as a $500 Bose unit, but as someone who has owned several iHomes and other players over the years, this has to be at the top!
The Bluetooth functionality makes it easy to use without having to dock my iPhone. I bought this for my office, but I could easily see myself bring it on business trips or to the beach.

..

38708104 This little speaker is great. The sound is really fantastic and the setup with an iphone was as simple as it should be. There is no reason to spend more on the other mini speakers. After giving them a pretty good in store comparision the Logitech won and when I got it home without all the store background noise it was even better than I thought it would be. Don't spend $150 or more on another competing or "cooler" brand name speaker, this Logitech easily beats them all in the under $200 range.

..

38708104 Maybe mine is an abberation, or maybe it shows a lack of quality control at Logitech, but I bought my speaker yesterday after hearing one that sounded just fine. When I tested mine (with two bluetooth devices of my own, and two of others) the sound had very unacceptable distortion, even at moderate and low sound levels.
I can't imagine that this is typically the case, but now I'm spooked away from replacing the one I bought with another. Returned for refund, and very disappointed. A defective product shouldn't ever leave the factory if quality assurance is what it should be.
It should be noted that a significant Best Buy competitor has discontinued this very popular product. Coincidence?

38708104 Easy to handle, Quick reaction time, easy roll on mouse pad, Only (1)
long lasting battery. Absolutely Best Mouse I have ever owned!

..

38708104 I like the mouse and really enjoying to use it while I am at work. I never had any issues with this. I am planning to buy the same to my wife so that she never feel jealous of my mouse. ;)

..

38708104 Device is easy to use. I have used other Logitech mice before and this one is one of my favorite. It is very portable and connects with all devices I have tried so far without any install on the computer I am using. Really love this device.

..

38708104 The Logitech mouse is your standard mouse. I just like the Logitech devices. They work well.

..

38708104 I have bought several wireless mouse(s). This one is a little small, however I like that the battery life is longer because it goes into sleep mode when not in use.

..

38708104 Bought it for the laptop. Best price. Like the color. Easy to use.

..

38708104 Just plug it in and in about a minute you are using it. Love how it works on multiple surfaces.

..

38708104 I wanted a small stylist mouse and this worked perfectly.

..

38708104 This is a great product at an amazing price. It was recommended by the sales person and they were right

..

38708104 Nice product. Functions perfectly. Best BUY did price match as well :)

38708104 Easy to use - no reading required to install comfortable for all day typing

..

38708104 Replaced a previous MS Wireless Mobile Mouse that had its USB plug fall apart. The new USB plug is much more compact, no need to remove when packing up laptop. Fits the hand nicely, is used on hard surface with no mousepad.

..

38708104 I have 3 of these one for every computer it is nice not to have strings. This mouse is fast and easy to use.

..

38708104 Love this mouse. this is the second one that I have bought

..

38708104 This mouse is very good for the price. I purchased it on sale, but would have bought it at regular price.

..

38708104 good value. works great. Would buy again. enjoy it.

..

38708104 it seems I had to move it around too much and all over the desk

..

38708104 good for the price will see how it holds uo with time

..

38708104 I got this mouse for a 19 year old nephew who wanted something other than the laptop trackpad. He loves it. It works great, has a tough build quality and was very easy to set up on Windows 7. The battery life is great and it helps that the mouse has a on/off switch that is somewhat recessed so that it cannot accidentally get turned on/off.
For users a bit older or with large hands, this mouse may be a bit on the teeny side but I still found that it was easy to control and move.
This is a great beginner mouse for young ones for the price!

..

38708104 Wouldn't recommend to anyone who plans on using this mouse for any other purpose than internet browsing. Wouldn't even recommend it in this case scenario considering the price isn't worth the quality. Spend your money on any other mouse besides this one.

Microsoft Wireless Comfort Desktop 5000 Keyboard and Mouse is a design and comfort merge, giving you a powerful desktop set optimized for Windows 7. Don't overlook the importance of comfort - make your time on the computer more relaxing and productive.


..

38708104 The keyboard and mouse worked great for about a year until the rubber wheel of the mouse fell apart. I have never had a mouse wheel fall apart. Now both keyboard and mouse have to be replaced. Tried replacing just the mouse with the same model type but no joy. Microsoft quality control needs some work

..

38708104 Good and comfortable keyboard with full size mouse.

..

38708104 I loved it, everything about it. It doesn't work with my Samsung TV so I'll use it for my home computer instead. I've been using Microsoft ergo keyboards since 1995.
I'd like to see it with a small solar panel to recharge the keyboard, but that the only improvement I can think of.
A sold 5 out of 5 stars.

..

38708104 I needed an ergonomic keyboard I could carry with me since laptop keyboards are too small and cause my wrists to hurt. This one isn't the best ergo keyboard in the world, but it's relatively compact which makes it ideal for travel.
I learned that I needed to take the batteries out of it whenever it goes into the backpack because apparently it still tries to send key-presses to the laptop, even when the bluetooth USB is not plugged into the machine. Batteries didn't last long installed in the keyboard while in the confines of the laptop bag.

..

38708104 Love this keyboard this is my second one!! I have one at work and one at home, very comfortable!!

..

38708104 I got this so I could work from a recliner on my big screen tv
the receiver would not pick up the keyboard on the back of the tower so i had to use a USB extension to get it ti work reliably.
the mouse scroll is almost useless on flash apps
If i didn't want to get rid of the cords i would go back to my corded mouse and keyboard.

..

38708104 This was a replacement of my Logitech wireless that stopped working. It's a bit pricy, but its working

..

38708104 Keyboard has lots of "bells & whistles", which are useless if you are not a power computer user.

..

38708104 I replaced an old wireless mouse/keyboard that constantly lost the signal or just didn't perform well. So far, this combo set has worked flawlessly.

..

38708104 It's very convenient to use the desktop now. I truly enjoy the "wireless" concept.

38708104 Since it's part of Best Buy I'd prefer to pay for the item at the store this way I get a receipt and not a packing slip, if something should wrong with the item I should be able to bring the item to any Best Buy store with receipt this way they can take care of an exchange then they can email us when the new item has arrived.
If you need the new battery it should only cost around 9 dollars some stores are charging 35 dollars even above retail suggestive price

34687513 I set the machine up, and started using it. Within 10-12 hours, the lamp burned out. The very cheap-looking remote control never did work, probably because the batteries were dead on arrival. I was very disappointed with the equipment.

34687513 I use this microphone for recording sound for training videos. The quality is good, the set up was easy and I've had no issues with it. There is a red light on it when it's on but no off button that I've found yet. Also has a 1, 2 or 3 for quality selection but I haven't noticed a difference using them.

34687513 This printer has worked out wonderful. Another great product from Cannon!!

..

34687513 It's easy to use. Prints out beautiful pictures. My 13 year old son was able to set it up by himself.

..

34687513 I am a photographer that uses this printer for on-sight printing; photo booths,etc.
The first time setup is a little time consuming. Do not expect to open the box and print.
This printer works great. It's super easy and has good quality. After the initial setup, it works like a dream.

..

34687513 Great printer! I would definitely recommend it!!!!

..

34687513 Decent printer. Just takes it awhile to warm up. Would recommend

..

34687513 Greate printer for the price for both photos and documents. Paper tray does not hold much.

..

34687513 The set-up was easy as the printer walked you through the steps. It prints really nicely and I love the borderless print option. The starter ink was more than I was expecting. I've printed color and black and white documents for a month and haven't run out yet. It takes a bit to wake up, but then prints fast. It prints the last page first so that when the document is done, it is in order from page one to the end without having the sort pages. The printing is loud and the paper tray is at the very bottom of the device, so if anything is sitting in front if it, you have to move it to open the paper tray. The scanner software is awkward and took me a while to figure out how to get the scan to save as a JPG because the default is a PDF. It also took a bit to learn how to save the document after scanning. But, about 10 minutes and I am a pro. You really can't break it even if you push a lot of buttons because the touch screen is very helpful. I would recommend this printer. I only use Canon printers and I am not disappointed by this one.

34687513 We needed a new home all-in-one printer for everyone to use with computers and tablets. This one looked nice (compared to others) and had a lot of features. We use the Cloud Print features and wireless printing from tablets, cell phones, and laptops. It is easy to use and setup. So far, about a month, we have had no problems.

..

34687513 I thought I was really going to love this printer, then I ran into the control setup for the scanner. It insists on putting all text into PDF even thought I need it in word. I have yet to find a way to scan just a portion of a document. I have managed to get it to scan a photo in jpeg, but it choses to ignore that if there is a hint of text. PDF time. The editing program it puts the scan into also is almost impossible to use. I miss my old Dell 715 w scanning program. I also have issues with the copy program. It does not like to do just a single document.

..

34687513 I was looking for a specific type of multi-function printer. Print/scan/document feeder. When at my local store, the associate pointed me out to a few options. This printer, sitting all alone on the side of the displays keep catching my eye. Its sleek, no button look was very attractive to me. Seeing that it obviously had no ADF, I asked about it anyway. The associate didn't know much about it, but foregoing my document feeder requirement I couldn't pass it up, especially for the price.
Wi-Fi setup is very easy, especially if your router has a WPS button. If not, it's still not too hard to set up. Currently setup on a desktop PC, windows laptop, MacBook Pro. Also if you have an iPhone/iPad, it works with airprint.
After about 6 months now of use I can say I couldn't be happier. Printing my documents on "fast" mode this printer still looks better than my old, ancient Lexmark on normal. After printing, I'd say, a couple hundred pages, I am still on my original set of starter inks that shipped with the printer. I love the fact that it has a 6 separate ink cartridge set (c, m, y, k, grey, document black). After warm-up, it prints as fast as it can spit out paper.
The only downsides are that because everything is touch, you get fingerprints on the machine. Also doesn't have ADF, but I can't fault the printer for that because I knew what I was buying. Some may say this printer may have too big of a footprint due to the horizontal load paper cartridges, but I find that for a printer with a flatbed scanner, it's as small as it can be.

Efficiently print, copy and scan documents and photos with this Canon PIXMA MG5520 8580B021 wireless all-in-one printer that features 3-in-1 functionality for versatile use. A 2.5" LCD makes it simple to view, select and edit images.


..

34687513 I've had this printer a bit longer than a month. It worked great the first week or so but suddenly it would not accept paper from the front tray without a fight. I need to put one sheet in. Hold it in place and try to coax it into the printer. Photo paper, either 5X7 or 8X10, will not load at all. It will repeatedly throw an error until it decides to accept whichever piece of paper you've tried to load. This is the second Canon that I've had in the last 6 months with this exact problem. Luckily, I bought the protection plan and will be returning it today.

Wirelessly print quality documents with this Canon PIXMA MG6320 all-in-one printer that features Apple AirPrint and Google Cloud Print, which allow printing from select mobile devices, and a built-in wireless LAN for easy Web connectivity.


..

34687513 This printer has worked out wonderful. Another great product from Cannon!!

..

34687513 It's easy to use. Prints out beautiful pictures. My 13 year old son was able to set it up by himself.

..

34687513 I am a photographer that uses this printer for on-sight printing; photo booths,etc.
The first time setup is a little time consuming. Do not expect to open the box and print.
This printer works great. It's super easy and has good quality. After the initial setup, it works like a dream.

..

34687513 Great printer! I would definitely recommend it!!!!

..

34687513 Decent printer. Just takes it awhile to warm up. Would recommend

..

34687513 Greate printer for the price for both photos and documents. Paper tray does not hold much.

..

34687513 The set-up was easy as the printer walked you through the steps. It prints really nicely and I love the borderless print option. The starter ink was more than I was expecting. I've printed color and black and white documents for a month and haven't run out yet. It takes a bit to wake up, but then prints fast. It prints the last page first so that when the document is done, it is in order from page one to the end without having the sort pages. The printing is loud and the paper tray is at the very bottom of the device, so if anything is sitting in front if it, you have to move it to open the paper tray. The scanner software is awkward and took me a while to figure out how to get the scan to save as a JPG because the default is a PDF. It also took a bit to learn how to save the document after scanning. But, about 10 minutes and I am a pro.

..

34687513 Overall a great compact design for printing. Scanner top will fit thick items which was one of my main criteria. I like how the printer is as dust free as possible. Great design of the item. Only negative is that its a bit slow when going out of sleep to print mode. Other than that its a great printer. Paid $59.99 for it.

34687513 Very satisfied with purchase. Store matched Internet price.

Snap photos even in tough conditions with this Canon PowerShot D20 12.1-megapixel digital camera that is waterproof up to 33' and shockproof up to 5' for durability on the go.Memory card sold separately.


..

34687513 We had the Canon D10 and it worked well for a couple of years and then conked. It was too expensive to fix so we got the D20 which all of a sudden stopped working we thought it was a drained battery but then the LCD was blurred and fuzzy. It must have water in it even if the lock was on all the time. I hope Best Buy will replace the unit.

..

34687513 We had purchased a previous version of the D20. I got water in it when I accidentally bumped the door. So the new camera has better doors to take care of the problem. But I epoxied the AV door shut so that one won't ever leak. We never use the AV anyway. The controls are better than the older one. Can go anywere with worry of getting wet or whatever.

..

34687513 I bought this camera for hiking trips. I love Canon products and have been a very satisfied customer of theirs for over 30 years. This camera continues the same great tradition of Canon quality. It is solid and built very well, yet it is very easy to use and the controls are easy to navigate. The photos are incredible. This camera has one of the best metering systems I've ever seen on a camera - backlit scene? no problem, perfect photo every time. I highly recommend this camera.

..

34687513 Gave this as a gift to my husband to use when we are snorkeling!

..

34687513 The camera performs as expected! We haven't had a chance to take it to any major water areas, but we've done some tests at home. We bought this for an upcoming trip and I will update my review, if possible.
One of the major things that sold me on this specific model is that I own other Canon point and shoot models, and they use this same battery type. This makes things very easy when swapping batteries/memory cards!

..

34687513 Great kit, wish it took a 64gb card and GPS would lock faster.

..

34687513 wow just wow! pictures are so clear under water. I would recommend this to anybody that love to take photos during their vacations.

..

34687513 I bought this camera for taking pictures of waves & surfers in the ocean, and while I have gotten some good photographs I was disappointed when it broke after only about three weeks of use. The camera does still take pictures but will no longer zoom in, allow me to view previous pictures or record video. It is also stuck in auto mode so basically it only takes pictures now and that's it, none of the buttons work, except for the on/off & the button that takes the pictures.

..

34687513 We bought this camera to take underwater shots while in Hawaii. The pictures turned out excellent! The colors were sharp and definition was great considering how fast the fish were swimming. Had no problems with camera leaking. I would definitely buy a back-up battery to take with. Battery died sooner than expected. Overall, I was extremely pleased with the camera and the excellent photos we got from our trip.

..

34687513 We took camera to the Mayan Riviera in oct 2012. Very sophisticated little camera that made underwater photography so incred easy. The great thing was that all of the programs were easy to use. Camera took pictures that were of the same quality of my Canon digital slr(t3i). So easy to carry around on vacation without worry of salt sand or sea ruining it. Cant say enough good about the camera or how pleasantly surprised we were with it!

Capture stunning images of family and friends with this Canon PowerShot ELPH 115 IS 8605B004 digital camera, which features a 16.0-megapixel CCD sensor that enables you to shoot crisp photos and high-definition videos with 720p resolution.


..

34687513 I bought this camera for a trip I took at the end of June, and this was the perfect camera. The zoom is amazing and it has a great picture quality. The only downside was I had to keep recharging the battery (but I think that was because I was taking so many pictures each day). I would suggest this to anyone who needed a new camera!

..

34687513 This pkg is the best. The camera case is nicer than other offers at other stores. I have always purchased Olympus cameras. The batteries finally gave out & I decided to try the Elph. With the exception of the defective Dane Elec 8gb memory card, I am happy with this purchase. The camera works fine with a different brand memory card. I wish they would provide a manual but it is similar to my other cameras so I could load in the battery & start shooting pics. It takes great low light pics across a room too. I downgraded the rating because of the faulty memory card.

..

34687513 I purchased this because the value was great. The camera takes great pictures and it is so compact.

..

34687513 I was looking for a simple camera to take great pictures with and this camera surprised me. The pictures I took came out stunning and clear for the price and I was surprised to find out that the video quality was even better. The sound is decent but it definitely picks up voices more clearer when you're obviously closer to it. Overall, I'm happy with my camera and love the blue color it came in...although I would've loved it better if it came in purple :) *hint hint*

The 60mm Waterproof Zoom Spotting Scope is a good choice for bird watching, nature or wildlife observation, hunting, and enjoying scenic views. This scope is extremely lightweight (under two pounds) and comes with both a soft case and an aluminum case. The high quality optics come at an economical price and enjoy a No Fault Limited Lifetime Warranty.


..

34687513 I bought this for viewing targets at the range, and am very happy with it. I know there are scopes with much better optical quality, but for what I need it works great. Seeing a hole in paper at 100 yards is no problem.

The Wireless-N Internet Home Monitoring Camera is designed to send live video to your home computers, or through the Internet to a web browser or smart phone anywhere in the world! This compact, self-contained unit lets you keep track of your home, your kids, your workplace whatever's important to you.


..

34687513 I purchased this camera to record any motion that took place in my home while I was away from home. Setting up the camera on my wireless network was relatively easy, but setting up the camera so I could access it wirelessly has proven to be impossible. I purchased the camera in March 2012 and still haven't been able to set up a TZO account. Everytime I try, I get kicked out of the program with a message indicating that my camera cannot be setup for remote access. I was told my Cisco that my old router didn't support some of the camera features so I bought a new router and SURPRISE, I still had some of the same issues. It took a few tries to setup the motion detection feature, but that eventually worked althought it didn't work all the time. I could sometimes walk back and forth in front the camera and I wouldn't get a "motion detection" e-mail. After about 4 months of sporadic motion detection e-mails, I noticed that the e-mails stopped altogether. I tried unstalling and reinstalling the camera a couple times and searched numerous message boards for a solution. All of the test e-mails I send from the camera settings page have failed. The motion detection hasn't worked in almost a month and I'm just going to try something new. This camera has never met my expectations #which weren't that high to begin with# and I don't want to waste any more time trying to figure out why it has stopped working. I wish I had ready the reviews before I made my purchase so I would have known what to expect.

..

34687513 I had a miserable experience all around with this product and with the support provided by Logitech. First, after hours of troubleshooting (some of this with the "help" of Logitechh tech support in India) I determined that this camera wouldn't work with the WPA/WPA2 Personal encryption settings on my Apple Airport Extreme. i setup a second access point with Open security and voila', the camera worked. This also came after Logitech offered to help me futher if I'd spend $9.95 with them! Let's just say, I didn't react well to this offer. Once the camera was working, i was disappointed to see how sensitive the device was to placement in my house. 1 ft in any direction caused the camera to disconnect from my wi-fi network and need to be rebooted. This went right back in the box and has been returned. There are proably better options than this one.

..

34687513 Works well with good image.
Had issues getting it work with my router/ISP. I have Uverse and so I had to use the Uverse smtp servers/account to allow email notifications in the motion detection section. Once I did that, it was working fine. None of the other "free" ones out there worked. Your ISP is the culprit here, not the camera. They simply don't allow for non-native email routing.
Video capture for motion detection is only 5 seconds max, but it's usually enough to get a good shot of whatever it is you're monitoring.
Also, for DDNS, you WILL need to pay for annual service (about $20/yr). There are free alternatives, but they require additional setup and most likely a laptop/desktop that is always on.
And if you want multiple camera setup, you will need to map separate ports on your firewall to your cameras.. If you use port 80, make sure you require a username/password to view the image or everyone will see your live broadcast image (assuming they know your URL).
Software is a bit outdated, but it does what is advertised.
And honestly, it's not that expensive. There are much more expensive home camera systems out there.
Works great with mobile phones as all you need is a browser.
and finally. if you have a samba server, you can actually keep recordings on your network for review later.

..

34687513 Have been using this camera for three years now. Setup was easy with a little help from TZO. Camera is out on the net with TZO for $19 per year..a little more than a buck a month! Setting resolution to highest setting produces very clear video with minimal stutter. 13MB connection with Comcast has proven reliable and works 99% of the time. Camera is self maintaining, reboots upon power loss to this location and reconnects with no manual effort. I see many complaints with other posts, I have not experienced the same and I'm not an IT guy but do have enough experience to know nothing is point-click! If you don't understand the basics of technology, feel comfortable making changes to your router (guided or solo) you will more that likely stumble a bit. If you are using a very low speed internet connection you will experience low speed results as if the camera is the problem. Like everything else you get what you pay for and for the money this is a great device!

..

34687513 I have used Linksys IPCAMS for years.
For tips sheck out ipcam.speak-back.com

..

34687513 I really hate this camera!!! We use it in our child's room as a monitor the sound and picture quality are ok but could be better. The serious problem with this camera is it likes to disconnect for NO apparent reason. Then if this happens you have to go through the whole set-up process AGAIN......and half the time you get a Error saying it can't find your camera. NOT WORTH THE MONEY, OR PROBLEMS.

..

34687513 Over priced. It's a pain to set up for starters. But remote view is hard to set up and the free software doesn't work. I have a degree in computer networking and this has been the hardest install and will probably end up returning them. To be honest they probably would work better with there own router do to the settings. But bottom line is these are a pain in the butt. They do work better as a standard web cam but not as a home monitor cam.
This is the worst product I have ever had from Cisco / lynksys.

..

34687513 I have a Belkin N600 router. The box on the camera says N so I assumed it would work. Hooked up camera, instructions were good, had it up and running internally in minimal time. Since I want the ability to see the camera remotely, I went through the setup for that. Cisco has partnered with TZO on this..they will set up a website from which you can access the camera on the internet. TZO has not yet certified with Belkin although they have on many other routers. Also you will have to pay $25-30 annual fees to TZO after the free 90 days run out.
I am not expert enough in telecommunications to attempt to try to do this with another DDNS carrier. Also, I am afraid that Time Warner who is my ISP has blocked port 80 which is needed. I have no one to easily go to to resolve this. Took it back.

..

34687513 Don't buy this camera. None of the enclosed instructions or drivers are valid or up to date. Expect to call Linksys Support. Then if you don't have a Linksys consumer router or if you have a Linksys business router, forget about making it work.

..

34687513 640x480 resolution went out the door long ago. However, of my 3 models of LINKSYS cameras (54G, 54GCA and 80N), this is by far the best as far as vision in the dark and sound quality.

The sleek, attractive thermal carafe and stainless accents blend seamlessly to achieve a classic look with modern conveniences. With easy 24-hour programmability to ensure a fresh pot of coffee anytime, and a 1-4 cup setting to maintain the delicious coffee taste when making a smaller pot, this 10-cup coffeemaker is a smart addition to the countertop. And the gold-tone coffee filter and charcoal water filter always ensure fresh, great tasting coffee.


..

34687513 This is our 2nd Cuisanart coffee maker. Our first one we bought had the built in grinder which I would not recommend, and it died less than a year after we bought it. That coffee maker lasted for 4 years after the grinder died however and why we went with this model. This one is a bit different. Highly recommend just using the permanent filter, especially with the cone design because otherwise, you do risk a mess. Cuisanart makes replacement/secondary pots, so even though it's only a 10 cup, you can certainly get the 2nd pot and have one on the deck, and one in the kitchen. The quality of this one over our 1st one does seem to be a bit cheaper made, thinner plastic, and the reservoir is a bit awkward to fill, since it's a narrow opening, however overall a great unit!

..

34687513 You have to fill up the stainless steel carafe with hot water 1st to get the carafe hot. Then it is like a thermos that will stay hot for hours! Also I like the fact that the carafe is metal so if you drop it it does not shatter like a glass carafe would. Then it would be very aggravating to go thru the hassle of finding the right carafe again.

..

34687513 Love the way it keeps our coffee warm. So nice that I bought my mom and dad one also. Have had ours for over a year and still pleased with it.

..

34687513 A great product that makes tasty coffee. My only dislike is the height - to fill it with water and coffee you must pull it to the front edge of the countertop from under the cabinet above in order to open the top.

..

34687513 Had this for a month. Gave it a good try. Coffee cools too quickly without a hot plate. On cold days, the carafe cools veryy quickly. The filter has to be removed to fill the water tank. Bubbles in the water tank go into the filling meter, and will not come out unless you remove all the water. Putting the carafe into the coffee maker is a bit difficult. Generally, I can't wait to get rid of this coffee maker and get onw that's useful!

..

34687513 Its easy to operate, makes great coffee and looks fantastic out on the countertop!

..

34687513 The thermal carafe is wonderful. Keeps coffee hot and the maker brews quickly. Love the fact that this coffee maker has a 3 year warranty, although, I do not expect to need it, its just nice to have for no more money than other "comparable" makers!

..

Whip up tasty treats with this blender that attaches to the high-speed power outlet on Cuisinart stand mixers. 12 speeds power through a variety of ingredients to meet the needs of different recipes.


..

34687513 I bought this blender two months ago and now me and my son couldn't live without it. I use it twice a day for smoothie and it blend very well and very easy to clean. Since I already had a mixer and only needed to buy this blender attachment, which was quite a saving. Some people complain about the loud noise made by blender, actually, there is no blender on the earth that doesn't have loud noise.

Prepare your toasted breads just the way you like them with this Cuisinart CPT-122 2-slice wide-slot toaster that features a 7-setting shade dial for simple customization and a slide-out crumb tray for easy cleaning.


..

34687513 One side of the toast browns while the other side burns. The very thing that I was replacing when I purchased this toaster.

..

34687513 I have gotten perfect toast and toasted bagels a dozen times so far

..

34687513 5 stars for this toaster. I already had the 4 slice toaster but my son wanted a 2 slice for his apt.

..

34687513 Even though this is an inexpensive toaster, do not buy it. Spend a little extra money and get one that will work correctly. I have this and am very unhappy. It burns bread on the lowest setting. The only way around is to watch and end teh toasting cycle before it's complete to prevent the burning.

Prepare toast, English muffins, bagels, frozen waffles and more in this Cuisinart CPT-435 4-slice toaster that features bagel, defrost and reheat options for optimal results. The 7 shade settings allow you to brown your toast to your preference.


..

34687513 I think I am going to return it since it should at least be able to toast for the price

..

34687513 It does what it claims but if I didn't get it on sale I would think I got ripped off. It looks very nice and works well. Toasts bread and bagels nicely.

34687513 It is a nice toaster it toast pretty fast just don't brown the same on both sides

Toast your bagel or bread just the way you like it with this Cuisinart CPT-142 4-slice wide-slot toaster that features dual 7-setting shade dials for custom browning and a slide-out crumb tray for easy cleaning.


..

34687513 Not a bad value for this toaster. It looks great, can toast up to four slices up bread or two bagels at the same time. Its easy to set up & easy to clean. Will never burn your bread because even on the highest setting bread is brown and crisp not burned. Use it all the time and no issues so far.

34687513 I had earlier purchases of Cuisinart, but this one i like the most. good nonstick reliability

..

34687513 i enjoy cooking with this set, non stick is great.

..

34687513 Im in love with my new cookware set ....They are all I use now...

..

34687513 i bougt this item on christmas sale and i think it was a good deal.

..

34687513 I am very glad I bought this set. The color is wonderful, and the quality is very high! Quality non stick cookware.

..

34687513 Cuisinart is a well known name so I expected this cookware set to be of good quality, really be non-stick, and be visually appealing. And I got exactly what I bargained for. The RED color cookware gives the kitchen a pop versus the traditional black or titanium colors. I'd recommend that other people purchase this cookware set. Thus far I haven't had it for very long but so far so good.

..

34687513 These pans perform as described; nothing sticks to them and they are very easy to wash!

..

34687513 Great price . wonderful looking . love them ......

..

34687513 My wife has really enjoyed using these pots and pans since we purchased them. We previously had pretty outdated and mismatched items, so this has been a very welcome upgrade. She likes how the surfaces of all the items feel, and thinks they will last a very long time.

Enjoy a cookout with this Cuisinart All Foods CGG-240 gas grill that features a 15,000 BTU stainless-steel loop burner to quickly heat food. The folding cart and large wheels allow easy transport at picnics, the beach, campgrounds and more.


..

34687513 Our balcony doesn't fit a normal grill so this was a great option, plus it will double as a great tailgate grill. Cooks evenly and heats up quickly. Takes small propane canisters and you need to pay $20 for an additional accessory if you want to attach a standard tank. I'd highly recommend that.

..

34687513 
The storage crock included with this Cuisinart barrel handle tool set lets you easily store the tools for simple organization and easy retrieval. The heat-resistant design enables use at temperatures up to 425 for versatility.


..

34687513 Everything in there works well and feels durable..

..

34687513 
The carafe with this coffeemaker features an ergonomic handle for a comfortable grip and a knuckle guard to protect your hand while pouring. The dripless spout minimizes spills and messes for added convenience.


..

34687513 Bought this 2 months ago and so far it is working great. Makes good coffee and relatively easy to clean. I use the No 4 filters instead of the gold filter because the gold filter is a little messy to clean.

..

34687513 Pretty good coffee maker. Comes with its own filter, convenient. Has ability to store water and make only desired amounts. Nice design. Has a heater for the pot.

..

34687513 It makes a good 12-cup pot of coffee in minutes. My husband and I like our coffee pretty strong though so I wish it had a brew strength adjustment.

..

34687513 I purchased this coffee brewer to replace a 2 in 1 brewer to save counter space. I read a lot of reviews,and settled on this brewer. My friend and coworker recommended this one too. Coffee brews 8 to ten cups fairly quick. The coffee is also hot. I use it everyday. The 1 to 4 cup feature works good. The hot plate setting on low keeps coffee hot for 2 hours .
I have not used the timer. This coffee maker is the best one I've owned so far. I've taken my own coffee to work in a thermos for 20 years .Time will tell about durability.

..

34687513 This is my second Cuisinart, and both have failed in relatively short times. The first one lasted for about 1.5 years, and the second only lasted a year. My previous Braun, brewed great coffee for 14 years without a problem. These units seems to suffer from unreliable electronics and poor quality control.

..

34687513 We are always burning out coffee makers because we always turn them back on if they have a 2-hour automatic shut off and if they don't have automatic shutoff we forget and leave it on. You can set this one to a four hour shutoff which is just right and you can also set the strength and how hot you want your coffee to be. Best coffee maker I've found!

..

34687513 This was a present about 8 years ago, and it works the same as it did the day I got it. If your looking for a quality machine for a good price this is it. This machine is not a 200-300 dollar Bunn, so don't expect instant coffee, it takes a few minutes to brew, but I just thought I would give my input since it's never let me down after all these years.

..

34687513 This is our first Cuisinart..love the look..love the coffee pot..pours so easily..would definitely buy another.

..

34687513 Great coffee maker. Makes excellent coffee and has setting for those of us who like our coffee hot. Easy to use and looks great with the stainless steel exterior. We have used this coffee maker for years and loved it; bought it originally because it got such great ratings. Just bought another one as a joke.

..

34687513 My last maker like this lasted 9 years and if this new one lasts that long it will be great. The old one still worked but warmer started to go out wouldn't keep coffee hot. Nothing bad to say except it needs to be a larger capacity.

..

34687513 
Get great grilled flavor every day from this compact, high-performance grill. Its small format can be put almost anywhere for ultimate convenience. And although the grill is compact, its ample cooking grate is large enough to cook most family meals - 8 steaks, 8 hamburgers, 6 - 10 chicken breasts, or over 4 lbs. of fish! The grill heats up very quickly, and uses far less gas than a full-sized grill. Best of all, with its great portability features this grill can cook your meals wherever you go - the beach, the game, the campsite - anywhere! Folding legs, grill lid latch, generous carry handle, and the spill resistant drip tray all enhance portability.


..

34687513 I'm a real BBQ er. This grill gave me fits. I burned everything. Including brats. The center shield flares up and causes problems.

..

34687513 
Equip your kitchen with this cookware set that includes 2 saucepans, 2 skillets, a saut pan, a stockpot, a universal steamer and a pasta insert. Stainless-steel handles provide strength and durability.


..

34687513 Love the product, the selections of pans in the package covers our needs perfectly.

..

34687513 I have had no problems with food sticking. I like the weight and looks of the pans. Best of all I have a variety of pans that will last.

..

34687513 I would say this product is a great deal for the price. It does cook foods well and is very durable. With that said, my dislike for the product would be that it is not "stick free" and it takes more effort to clean it because it does "tarnish" in places and looks as if it isn't clean. I have been hand washing the products and the info that comes with the product states that lemon juice can be used to remove the "tarnish" marks food may leave. This does work, however; I like to be able to put items in the dishwasher and let them go and you cannot do that with this product. If you do buy this product, you will not be disappointed, just make sure you remember to use cooking spray when cooking and lemon juice when the items get "tarnished".

..

34687513 I've owned this set for almost 2 years now and absolutely LOVE everything about them. I had been using hand-me-downs and cheap pots and pans for 20 years before I got this set. I threw out everything I had before once these were out of the box. The cookware heats evenly. I've had no issues with food sticking. They clean up well and are still shiny like new.
I do not was them in the dishwasher and I use Dawn Dishwashing Detergent as recommended. A Mr. Clean Magic Eraser (without the abrasive side) works well to remove stains when you don't have Barkeeper's Helper on had.

..

34687513 I bougth this for my wife this cristmas and she loves them! My wife is 22 years old and she loves to cook and her dream is to become a professional chef one day, so for I decided to giver this as a present since we only had 2 $5 pan and thats was it! So she couldnt really make a whole lots of foods, but now I've gain over 1 pounds!. She told me that everything cooks vey fast and even.
CONS: they are not NON-stick, scratch vey easy (but this does damage the pans),.

..

34687513 But..why would you? With Best Buy's great offers, this is practically a steal.
This is one of the best values out there, and if its too much for your pocketbook but you want to get the quality then go for the smaller 10 pc or 7 pc set. If you invest properly the first time in a cookware set, then you wont likely need to replace it five years down the road..you really do get what you pay for sometimes.
Remember stainless steel does not mean non stick..use proper cooking techniques, and lubrication to achieve greater results.
Stainless does stain by the way from use, if you are not properly cleaning it. Bar Keepers Friend is perfect for this set to keep it looking well for years to come.
Note the encapsulated base- that means more even heating- Most stainless sets don't tell you how the stainless is set throughout and that means no base for distribution of even heat.
For my money, this is worth it.

..

34687513 
This 17-piece cookware set includes 3 covered saucepans, 3 skillets, a saut pan, a stockpot, a multisteamer insert and a pasta insert. The hard anodized exterior ensures fast and even heating, while the riveted handles provide a comfortable grip.


..

34687513 Great set for any type of cooking. The pans cook food fast and easy and the handles are great for the pots so your hands don't burn.

..

34687513 These guys are great. It takes some getting used to because they allow you to cook with lower heats. They're oven safe. The stainless steel handles are great because they don't conduct heat as much so they're pretty safe to take right out of the oven.

..

34687513 
Prepare tasty meals with this Cuisinart Chef's Classic 77-7 cookware set that includes 2 saucepans, a stock pot and a skillet with aluminum-encapsulated bases for even heat distribution. The stainless-steel cooking surface maintains the flavor of food.


..

34687513 Needed new cookware, decided on this, it is awesome.

..

34687513 
Cook a variety of meals with this skillet that features a hard anodized exterior for fast and even heating and stainless-steel handles that provide a cool and comfortable grip. The sloped sides of the skillet help maximize the cooking area.


..

34687513 great frying pan does exactly what it's suppose to do . doesn't stick to frying pan ever.

..

34687513 
Deep fry snacks easily with this compact deep fryer that holds up to 3/4 lb. of food and features a die-cast frying bowl that keeps the oil at a consistent temperature for even frying. The charcoal filter removes frying odors from your kitchen.


..

34687513 For the price this is a must for someone that loves deep frying.
I bought 1 liter of organic sunflower oil and made coconut shrimp in it and they came out crisp and golden just right. A week later I fried some egg rolls and those came out great too. I like that the basket attaches to the rim so the oil has some time to drain, and the cover is a big plus also no smell on your walls or cabinets if you cook near them. The great thing is that it works on exactly 1 liter of oil which means you don't have to open another bottle. It also looks very nice in the kitchen.
THe only con I could come up with is that it could've had a built-in twist timer, but you can buy one at a store for like 2 bucks anyway.
All in All I hope it lives up to its name!

..

34687513 I purchased this deep fryer 2 years ago, and I loved it ever since. It's the perfect size for my family of three, I've used it for shrimp, plantain, fries, chicken wings, you name it. Its easy to clean and doesn't require that much oil so I get to change the oil more often and saves me money on the long run. Plus it looks nice on the kitchen and doesn't take much space.

..

34687513 I recently bought this deep fryer. I used it twice and went to wash it and discovered the enamel peeling off. So I called Cuisinart to get them to replace it since it was in warranty and they said "sure", BUT they want to charge you $10 to replace it and then you have to pay shipping costs to send the one I had back which in total charged me $23. Thats half what I paid for the thing. All in all this one better be worth the $78 I pretty much paid for it. Sometimes I guess we should just take our losses.

..

34687513 Really good item definitely reccomend it to others

..

34687513 it's good price, compare to other brand name. good for busy people with 4 to go size cups and full size set.

..

34687513 I was looking for a blender with a small footprint to use for making protein shakes. I didn't want to spend $100 on a blender and the small $14.99 blenders at other stores didn't look very sturdy. The Cuisinart SmartPower 32-Oz. Blending/Chopping System fit my needs (and my budget) perfectly. I love the look of this blender (chrome and black combination) and it fits in beautifully in my kitchen. It's small enough that I can pack it in my suitcase and take it on vacation, too! My only comment would be that you need to break up ice cubes before putting them in the blender -- otherwise, they can cause it to jam. Other than that, it comes with 4 blending jars (with lids) and a chopping cup (with lid) and it a very welcome addition to my kitchen!

..

34687513 I brought this so that I could make myself healthy smoothies. I did a lot of research on the internet, and, found that this smoothie maker was the best, for the price. However, when I started using it, a burning smell was coming from the motor, and, the unit was making loud noises. After a week of using the unit, the motor burnt out in it. I immediately took it back to best buy, and, removed it from the box, so that the sales rep, who was taking care of me, could smell the burnt order coming from the motor. He gladly asked me if I wanted another unit, and, I said no. I just wanted a full refund. I am now saving up my money to purchase a really good blender/smoothie maker, which I am told, could run as high as $400.00. I guess sometimes it pays to purchase something that is more expensive.

..

34687513 I make a smoothie every day, and cleaning up the blender was getting old. I love this product. The cups are easy to clean and travel well. There is only one lid without an opening, but I just screw them on top of some saran, put it in my cooler, and I'm good to go.

..

34687513 The only thing that I would change is that the lids need a cover for the hole on top so you can't spill.

..

34687513 I really like this product. Easy to use and clean up after. The only criticizm is that it overheats rather easily. I guess I tend to make the smoothies too thick and it over heats and I have to wait for it to cool down before I can finish. But it is a great little product.

..

34687513 We make protein shakes almost everyday in our house, and its great being able blend it right up in the cup, add a straw and drink up. . The blender blades are powerful and it chops thru ice, frozen fruit and it makes the best smoothie protein shake ever. Not to mention I got a $20 rebate. Sweet deal :)

This Cuisinart Cook Central MSC-400 multicooker features a 4-quart nonstick cooking pot and 3 programmable functions that allow you to easily prepare a variety of dishes. A 90-minute steam option enables versatility.


..

34687513 Good cooker compared to others I've had. Holds the various temps very well from the low to high. While the cooking pot is coated cast aluminum, care must be used to not scratch the coating. So far everything cooked has come out exactly as planned. With others I have found the temps seem to vary with time and must be monitored closely and this is not the case with this cooker. You program it, turn it on and forget it. Would not hesitate to buy again.

..

34687513 
This electric kettle provides up to 1500W of heat for fast boiling times when you're making tea, hot cocoa or soup.


..

34687513 We have used the same Cuisinart Cordless Kettle every day for over 5 years and are now purching one for my sister. Our kettle has worked flawlessly, heats quickly, and is as clean inside today as it was the day it was purchased. The heating element is protected from the water so it never corrods and the inside of the stainless steel kettle has never had a problem with calcium scale buildup. Highly recommended - you will love it!!

..

34687513 I liked the design and the quality of the kettle. Moreover, it is much cheaper than other brand products.

..

34687513 
CPC-600 Electric Pressure Cooker is safe, easy to use, cooks up to 70% faster than conventional methods and cooks healthier, too. Steam trapped in the pot builds up pressure that creates hotter temperatures, and the pot is so tightly sealed that vitamins and minerals can't boil away. Foods stay moist and flavors stay true.


..

34687513 I'm very pleased. So much easier than using my stove top version. I like the deep cooking pot for soups, beans, and stews. The inner lid lining is a good idea also. I would definitely recommend this cooker to anyone who likes to pressure cook frequently.

..

34687513 Being familiar with stove top pressure cookers, they do not hold a candle to the Cuisinart - 6-Quart Electric Pressure Cooker. It is basically a set is and forget it. The pressure cooker does it all. You don't have to stand at the stove and try to keep the pressure even (sometimes hard to do on some stove models)

..

34687513 This is an amazing appliance. I have made turkey breasts in it an they are the moistest, best tasting turkey breasts I have ever had and there was only a 30 minute pressure cook time to make it. The clean up is a breeze. Highly recommend to everyone who will listen. There are about 6 people where I work that have added this appliance to their Christmas wish list.

..

34687513 First time we owned a pressure cooker. This had the best reviews for the size and was by far the best price for all the options. This is so easy to use and makes fabulous pot roasts, vegetables, & rice.

..

34687513 When I got this I really didn't know what to expect. I had heard a lot of pros of pressure cooking but wasn't sure if it was really up to all of the hype. I did a lot of checking before finally settling on this one. The instruction booklet isn't very user friendly in explaining things. I got more info off Google and YouTube than that booklet inside of it but, that is not a reflection of the machine itself.
Once you get the hang of it and figure out what they are actually saying the set up is so easy its almost embarrassing that the booklet confused so much. Its effortless! Like most I like easy and this is very easy. Use was a breeze and it performed perfectly. Literally start and walk away. The timer is loud enough to be heard in other rooms and even if you can't jump up and go to it right away, it auto goes into warm while it de-pressurizes itself.
I'm extremely happy with my purchase. I can see it will get a lot of use.

..

34687513 I tried another brand and loved it too but it died after 90 days.
This one has a 3 year warranty and has protection circuit features which keep it from overheating if what your cooking cooks down too low on water so that your bean soup sticks a little to the bottom. With the Cuisinart it senses this and shuts off whereas the other brand just dies.
If you research electric pressure cookers you'll find that many brands don't last that long. I highly recommend this one. I get a full freshly cooked meal in 45 minutes from start to finish.

..

34687513 I absolutely love this pressure cooker! It is convenient and quick. Cooks beans fast and completely, rice in 3 minutes after building pressure, and I can put something in at the last minute for dinner. Clean up is also fast and easy.

..

34687513 This helps make great meals fast. It is easy to use and very quite. I am so amazed with the ablilty to brown and saute in it. I just love it -what else can I say great tool to have.

..

34687513 I was recommended by my best friend who lives in NC about this product. It's multifunctional, time and energy-saving, good price, plus elegant design! It's very safe, easy to use, just 3 mins for rice and 35 mins for delicious soup that usually takes 6-8 hours cooking time for the slow cooker! I'm not afraid of last minute cook anymore even we might have unexpected guests coming for dinner!

Introducing an evolutionary new look in coffeemakers. The Cuisinart Brew Central Coffeemaker makes a bold statement with a brushed metal finish and an elegant tech-industrial design.

Cuisinart quality, performance and convenience -- now in new state-of-the-art packaging.

Open most standard-size cans with ease with this electric can opener that features a strong Power Cut blade and an extra-wide base for stability.


..

34687513 We are very pleased with the Cuisinart can opener!

..

34687513 Other can openers we have bought work for a while, then got very noisy then stopped working altogether. This is well made, runs quieter, and works like a charm.

..

34687513 Like its easy to use looks great and comes in handy

..

34687513 This can opener is great and is strong enough to be used in a commercial setting.

..

34687513 $50. and it quit working after about 6 months. Was a gift, so I don't have a receipt to exchange or return. Very disappointed with this product.

34687513 
Style, convenience, and power come together in the Cuisinart electric can opener. With Chrome accents and elegant contours, it fits in nicely with other modern countertop appliances. The easy single-touch operation effortlessly opens and standard size can. The precision Power Cut blade and strong magnetic lid holder are attached to the removable lever, which can be easily detached for quick cleanups.


..

34687513 Would like this to come apart to be cleaned but cuts nice and quickly.

..

34687513 Efficient , good product but we have to be careful when we try to open big Canned sometime the magnetic can not hold strong enough if the caneed to heavy.

..

34687513 I was having a hard time finding a tall can opener in white. This one was on sale for $29.99 and I had a $20 coupon so I only paid $9.99 and it has proven to be a fantastic buy.

..

34687513 I thought it would have a knife sharpener also.
It is a little to big for me..I am used to the smaller ones and it is not
as easy for me to handle...I guess I have to get used to it...

..

34687513 A solid can opener that does what it should. It has an attractive look in my kitchen, shallow enough and tall to accommodate large cans. It seems like it will last a long time, though the plastic components on the housing and activating lever won't last a lifetime.

..

34687513 This item was very good to used and a great price.

..

34687513 This is a good, solid can opener. It works well and is attractive in my kitchen. It hugs the counter, and is tall enough for most larger cans.

..

34687513 I found this product to be a good basic can opener. It doesn't have any frills, just does a good job of opening cans. The cutter assembly is easy to remove for cleaning. I would have paid a little more for it, if it had an automatic power cord rewinder.

..

34687513 I have had can opener and never were happy because it wears out fast and hard to use but this new Cuisinart - Deluxe Can Opener - Black is very easy to use and cut the can open easier. Very easy to handle.

..

34687513 I was looking for a basic can opener that matched my kitchen decor, would not take up a lot of space, was reasonably priced, was tall enough for large cans, and was easy to use. I took a chance on this one, ordering it online. It met all of my expectations. It is also easy to clean, because the cutting blade is easily to remove. The black color matches my other kitchen appliances, so that worked for me.

Pop up to 10 cups of popcorn in as little as 3 minutes with this Cuisinart EasyPop CPM-100W hot air popcorn maker, which directs popped kernels through the chute. Dishwasher-safe removable parts make cleanup easy.


..

34687513 Overall, this is a great popper for the price. We looked around for a while and this was our best option. Setting it up was a breeze and it does what it says. My only complaint is that sometimes the popcorn kernels will fly out onto the counter which can be annoying. If you're looking for a popcorn maker that is simple to use, this ones for you.

..

34687513 Our college apt living daughter needed one - we have had same product for a few years now - very easy to use and clean. Reliable product - you would have to be a moron to ruin your popcorn with this machine. Other brands of air poppers out for the holidays had HORRIBLE reviews so we stuck with this reliable brand. Quick shipping - Best Buy made this an easy transaction :)

..

34687513 I have had other brands and this one has worked best and is easy to use.

..

34687513 Popped corn flys out of popper all over kitchen! Tried 3 different types of pop corn with same results. Many un-popped kernels.

..

34687513 Very easy to use less of a mess no oil spilling can take anywhere. Convenient easy directions

..

34687513 It makes the popcorn fast it's very easy to use and it's a nice design.

..

34687513 Overall, this is a great little popcorn maker for the price. It makes popcorn in about 3 minutes like it said. While making the popcorn, a few of the popcorn kernels fly out. Not a big deal, but just be aware.

..

34687513 Family loves it, use use it everyday . It makes great popcorn fast and healthy. It's fun looking for different popcorn to pop. Great value, easy to clean.

..

34687513 We love the machine and look forward to trying different seasonings. This would be great for families and for kids to watch the popcorn pop!

..

34687513 I love this air popper. Now I can eat popcorn while watching TV and not feel guilty because it's healthy! So easy to use and easy to clean. Great price as well. Manufacturer's website has recipes if you want something different.

Prepare a variety of tasty egg dishes with this Cuisinart Egg Central CEC-10 egg cooker, which includes 2 trays that allow you to poach eggs and make omelets or cook up to 10 eggs in their shells.


..

34687513 i have tried for many years, many different techniques for the 'perfect' hard boiled egg. but they always crack, under done, over done, heat up the whole kitchen or dirty pans. but not now. i love this machine. super quick. easy peasy.

Volunteer to carve up the turkey at your family gathering this year with this electric knife, which features a powerful motor and 2 stainless-steel blades. The safety lock and one-touch pressure-activated on/off trigger help ensure safe and easy use.


..

34687513 We replaced an older electric knife with this model. I must say this is a better knife, it is not so bulky and is lighter weight than our older one. I can't find anything negative to say about this product. 5 stars!

..

Cut down on preparation tasks for your next meal with this 4-cup food processor that features touchpad controls and a SmartPower blade with auto-reversing ability to chop, grind or puree a variety of food.

Combining the Cuisinart tradition of culinary excellence with groundbreaking innovation, the Cuisinart Elite Collection 12-Cup Food Processor sets the bar for the next generation of kitchen appliances. With a 4-cup work bowl nested inside the big bowl, plus the adjustable 6-position slicing disc and reversible shredding disc, it provides home chefs with multiple food processors in oneThe exclusive SealTight Advantage System is designed to deliver maximum bowl capacity and clean processing and pouring. It is truly the finest food prep appliance available for today's modern kitchen.


..

34687513 I love the capacity of this processor. Incredibly quiet and fast. The only negative is that I tried to shred some carrots. The majority was shredded well; however, it couldn't shred all of my carrots. I don't know if the processor can only handle a certain quantity or what.

..

34687513 was reluctant to buy because previous reviews called this hard to clean. I have done everything imaginable that this machine has been designed for and have had no trouble betting it spotless. storage for extra attachments is by gallon ziploc bag.

..

34687513 This was my first food processor and I really wanted to buy a good one, so I did a lot of internet research. Money was not really an issue, but I still love a good deal.
The Cuisinart Elite 12 cup was really a bargain compared to the 11 cup Cuisinart that I almost purchased. The thing that sold me right off the bat were the cutting blades. The slicing blade is adjustable and functions as multiple blades. Same with the shredding blade which is reversable. The 11 cup model was less expensive, but not when you started buying additional blades and discs. This unit is larger, more powerful, and better value than the smaller one.
Another great feature is the way the lid seals with a rubber, spring-loaded gasket. The other one doesn't have it - just plastic on plastic. Also, this model has an inner bin that you can put inside the 12 cup bin if you want to process smaller amounts of food.
If you are going to buy a storage box for the blades, there is one available for this model that holds all the blades and discs. Really awesome setup!
This unit is heavy and powerful and quiet too. I wasn't sure I was going to like the silver color because I really wanted polished stainless, but this color is close and looks very high-end in my new kitchen.
The included DVD and cookbook are nice too, especially for someone like me who is new to using a food processor. Additionally, Bestbuy.com matched the Amazon price and shipped fast and free, so I couldn't be happier with my purchase.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

..

34687513 The Cuisinart - Elite Series 12-Cup Food Processor has a quiet and very powerful motor.

..

34687513 Great product, nice double bowl set up and the gasket makes using liquids super simple for cleanup. This model is super powerful and very fast. It looks great and the stainless steel body blends in perfectly with all of my appliances.

..

34687513 I have never had a food processor before, and now I will never go without one. I love this product!!

..

34687513 I can't say enough about this food processor. It is very quiet, very powerful and fast. We made enough coleslaw to feed and army in under 5 minutes. Cleanup was a snap and it stores nicely. Buy this machine today!

Always looking forward to that first cup of hot fresh coffee? Well now you can get it up to 25% faster with the Extreme Brew 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker! Packed with all your favorite features, this is truly the ultimate coffee-lover's machine.


..

34687513 This is a nice upgrade from my old Cuisinart that I had for 9 years. It worked fine and then the switch stopped working.

..

34687513 We had being looking for a quality and affordable coffee maker for some time. After seeing the reviews we decided to go with this one and are not disappointed. We have had it for over a month as of now.

..

34687513 It looks good and works well. What more could anyone want? We'd been living with a nightmare of a coffee maker that required pushing a button just to open it. Naturally, the button broke, the coffee maker jammed, and it was a mess. The Cuisinart Extreme Brew is a dream. The lid opens easily, and doesn't lock. The carafe doesn't leak when I pour water into the tank! Also, you can use paper or a permanent filter (which comes with the unit). It's just an all-around great coffee maker. Great value for the price.

..

34687513 This was Added to my list o Cuisinart Products that I already own. Plan on Buying more in the future.

..

34687513 Some small improvements on this model make it even better than the 1200 than I had for about 6 years. The water is easier to pour without making a mess and there is a water gauge on the side, so you can see how much water is already in the tank. It has a button to press for regular or bold coffee and the carafe seems to seat better on the warmer. It brews at the proper temperature to make good coffee. The coffee is made a bit quicker, also. All in all, I'm glad I tried this one. It seems worth the price so far.

..

34687513 This coffeemaker makes the best coffee my husband & I have had, and that includes 30+ years of drinking coffee! It looks great in our kitchen-not like the stainless on their other model, and works great. I would highly recommend this model to anyone. This replaced a cusinart model, and even with changing the filter regularly this model is superior!

..

34687513 This particular Cuisinart Coffee maker can make the cheapest coffee tastes fabulous. Even my mother agreed on how tasty the coffee was when I gave her one of the first cups on my new unit.
I would recommend this coffee maker highly. It gives a small alarm when the coffee is done and again when it is shutting off, which is in about an hour after the coffee was complete in the process of making delicious coffee.

..

34687513 It brews 6 cups in less than five minutes. Reusable filter is a big plus also.

..

34687513 It works well, brews quickly and keeps the coffee hot. It's too new to comment on durability, but very happy so far.

..

And it's completely free of PTFE and PFOA. The hard anodized construction provides high heat conductivity, which requires less energy to reach desired cooking temperatures.

34687513 
Easily cut up a variety of foods with this Cuisinart CTG-00-MAN mandoline slicer, which features ultrasharp stainless-steel blades to help ensure efficient slicing. The adjustable width makes it easy to switch between thick and thinly cut slices.


..

34687513 While I don't always need perfectly thin sliced potatoes or julienned carrots, when I do, this mandoline is perfect. And they included a cutting glove to help you avoid bloody knuckles. Genius!

..

The Cuisinart Mini-Prep Processor is the perfect kitchen helper for your small food preparation tasks. This compact processor occupies minimum counter space yet offers major advantages: more power than other choppers


..

34687513 I recently remodeled my kitchen and went with all stainless steel appliances. This was prefect for my space and my needs. I am very happy with the shipping, the delivery and the secure packaging. I will definitely order online from Best Buy again!!

..

34687513 great little chopper for daily use, only used it a few times so far, but seems to work well, i'm happy with it

..

34687513 While I have not used it much, it seems to work very well!

..

34687513 Easy to use, a quality product at a fair price. I bought this for my mom & she likes it a lot better than her old one, which was a different brand.
I marked 5 stars for durability, but that is unproven as of now. My mom has only used this three times so far.

..

34687513 What a great little, easy, convenient machine. Works perfectly, easy to use, easy to clean...if you need one of these just get this one - stop looking elsewhere.

..

34687513 The Cuisinart SS Processor is compact, easy to clean and use, and has a simple design that, I think, would make it difficult to break and would last a long time.

..

34687513 This is really convenient for things like fresh salsa. Its also useful for chopping nuts. I wouldnt use it on a daily basis though because its not easy to clean.

..

34687513 
The Mini-Prep Plus is the perfect little helper for small food preparation, from chopping herbs or bread crumbs, to finely grinding hard cheese. Its versatility lies in the special Auto Reversing Smart Blade, which makes it easier to process both soft and hard foods.Designed in Italy with the same look as Cuisinart's newly launched PowerPrep Plus, the Mini-Prep Plus' sleek touch pad controls afford easy cleaning and an elegant look. And despite its space-saving size, it's more powerful than other choppers. So now you can prepare small quantities of food faster and more efficiently than ever before.


..

34687513 A great mini food processor for any home cook! very powerful

..

34687513 great product easy to use durable recommend to everyone

..

34687513 I used to own the older version where you could vary the speed but had to physically remove and flip the blade for switching between soft and hard foods. I like that this has the convenience of doing both hard and soft foods without changing blades. I liked the old version's squarish design and chrome finish, this one has a very cheap looking plastic finish. I mostly use this for mincing garlic and ginger and is a good gadget to have handy.

..

34687513 This little guy is a time and labor saver. I use it to chop vegetables for nightly salad and other everyday chopping or grinding, it's very easy to use, and it is simple to clean. What more could you want?

..

34687513 The Cuisinart replaced a small Black and Decker chopper I had for years. The new one has a bigger capacity, which is very convenient. I no longer need to use my large food processor for small jobs. It does the jobs quite efficiently and cleans up easily. Also, It is easier to handle than other mini processors I considered. It has been a good purchase.

..

34687513 I bought this thinking that I could save time chopping tomatoes and onions when I cook, just like the pictures shown on the box. It is way too powerful though. This obliterates vegetables into a liquid and the tomatoes become salsa with just a slight push of the chopping button for 2 seconds. I gave it 2 stars because it is cheap and it does make dips, salsa, or drinks easily. I would not recommend if looking for just chopping.

..

34687513 I REALLY LOVE THE PRODUCT AND WOULD PURCHASE IT AS A GIFT FOR A FRIEND.

..

34687513 I love this. I use it everyday. It chops everything nice an small.

..

34687513 Ok for price would like to get larger one next time

..

34687513 This has two functions, to chop or grind. But it's more of a puree machine. I've made some really great soups! But it makes terrible salsa.

..

34687513 
Food preparation can be a pleasure or it can be a chore. Who couldn't use a little more pleasure? Turn your food prep into a simple, quick step.


..

34687513 This little processor works well. I like that I can leave it on the counter and avoid having to get out and return the large one and I like that it goes in the dishwasher. It is very easy to use and does a great job chopping and mincing.

..

34687513 You don't have to dirty the big processor. Running in both directions really does a more thorough job. It has plenty of power.

Dane-Elec 8GB CompactFlash (CF) Card - 43x - 8 GB

34687513 Excellent size, just what the doctor ordered. The 8 GB size is excellent for my camera resolution, allowing me to take over 1,000 photos before I have to dump them to permanent memory.

This Dell Venue 8 VEN83333BLK tablet's 8" multitouch display makes it easy to navigate Web content, media and other features, so you can remain entertained on the go. The 32GB storage capacity provides plenty of room for important files. 


..

34687513 price is good, finger prints are a problem, it has a separate disc drive besides the regular hard drive which most tablets don't.It is fast enough

..

34687513 I have mixed feelings about this tablet. I will admit it's a nice tablet and a respectable attempt by Dell... From all my research, I learned this was about the best "budget" tablet you could buy. I gave it a shot and found it to be nice. There is hardly no bloatware installed and after you connect it to WiFi, you are informed of the update to Android OS 4.3. There aren't many icons or widgets on any of the homescreens, which for some people is great.
Please understand that this tablet is over a year old, so compared to newer models... it's a bit bulky and heavy.. Although the screen is nice... it isn't as bright as the ones found on Samsung units. I like the fact that it comes with 32GB of storage with the option to install a MicroSD card. Believe it or not, the speaker was better than I was expecting...and it's located on the bottom side instead of the back... so volume levels are a little better.
Now comes the the bad part. I really wanted to love this tablet but there are a few flaws with it. It's advertised as having Wireless N connectivity. However, Wireless N is around 150MBps... and this tablet would only connect to my Wireless G signal (I have dual band router) at 54MBps. I did some tweaks and was able to increase the speed to 65MBps... and that's it. That's the fastest this will connect.
Another flaw with the tablet is.. Dell put both the usb port and volume buttons on the LEFT Side of the tablet. That was a mistake. The reason being is.. any case you buy for this tablet opens up like a book... with the middle being on the LEFT SIDE... so the tablet would have to remain open when you charged it. Furthermore, if you use the stand built into the case to in landscape mode, the tablet will have the charging port on the BOTTOM.. what that means is... you plug in the charger while the tablet is on a stand... That was an oversight by the Dell's designers.
Other than those design flaws, it's a solid case...

..

34687513 I would recommend to anyone. It is sure to please. I was concerned as to whether the size of the tablet would be sufficient -- it most definitely is.

..

34687513 Bought for my granddaughter and she loves it.fast wifi connection and comfortable to carry.average picture results and for selfie.overall nice and affordable tablet.

..

34687513 I purchased this tablet after many comparisons with similar tablets and I decided on this one due to the hdmi out that the specs state it has. I was disturbed when I tried to connect this device to my hd television and I was unable to due to the fact this device does not have an hdmi out port. I have written support and they still have not changed the spec sheet for this unit. Be aware it does not have an hdmi out port.

..

34687513 Bought this tablet primarily to learn & familiarize on current trend with the apps using Android OS.Have been using this tablet for a month now, and so far the experience using this tablet is hassle free. got this tablet to use for email,social media,watching Netflix and to be familiar with the Android apps as how the technology is trending now.
Only thing that concern me is the battery life but will really depend on how you use the tablet.Dont let it run out of power as I have experience look like a charging problem.
All in all I consider this a very good tablet.

Flip Video FVAUC1CP2 USB Cable - USB - 3 Pack - Type A USB - Type A USB


..

34687513 very good quality cables. just wished they could all be the same size

..

34687513 I bought these cables on sale. They came in three lengths and having three of them means I have a cable to charge my Flip anywhere I go.

..

34687513 The good:
Extremely easy to use. A child can operate and enjoy. Images are clear and recording dependable.
The bad:
Light meter is easily fooled when shooting in bright backgrounds, causing images to be too dark to use. Sound is only fair and doesn't easily transport when uploading to photo services.

..

34687513 These cables work and Match the color of your flip and the length is customizeable. You can also use them with you thumb drives. 3 cables means one for your desktop one for the laptop bag and 1 as a spare. They would be even better if the price was cheaper.

..

34687513 Others have written that these are unnecessary and rated them low because of the design of the Flip. That's not really a review of the cables, but one of the Flip itself...
These are great if you have an older computer that doesn't have USB ports on the front. That's the whole point of these cables, and the whole reason to get them. They are inexpensive and handy for other USB devices too, like thumb drives.

..

34687513 This product is so stupid because defeats the purpose of the flip camera.

..

34687513 Ok when i first seen it i thought it was something else but the i read it n seen it said usb cables i was like wow whats the whole purpose of having a usb pop out if they are going to try to make usb cables for it . i dont think people would have purchased the flip if they knew it would be difficult for them to load well atleast not me.

Capture high-resolution photos and video with this Fujifilm FinePix HS50EXR BLACK digital camera that features a 16.0-megapixel EXR CMOS II sensor for detailed images. The 42x optical and 2x digital zoom enable close-up shots of distant subjects.Memory card sold separately.


..

34687513 After a long wait for a new digital camera, and lots of online research, I finally broke down and bought the Fuji HS50 EXR. I was torn between a low end to mid range DSLR and long zoom "bridge" cameras like this one. The similar cameras from Canon, Nikon, Sony, etc. all had their merits, but none had the combination of a manually operated zoom lens plus a fully articulated LCD viewfinder. The Canon 50X zoom was a brief contender, but when I got one in my hands it seemed terribly plasticky and cheap. No texture or friction to the hand grip, just a small wimpy plastic thing. Pathetic. The 42X Nikon zoom model had a very nice feel to it, nice grippy rubber, but no hotshoe for an additional flash, and the LCD only tilted vertically.
The Fuji won out for me primarily because of the manually-operated zoom- why isn't this a more popular feature? It provides a much faster zoom speed, more precise control, uses no battery power, AND it is far less likely to break or jam than a motorized lens! This is what finally died on my previous camera, an Olympus, and it only had a relatively puny 18X zoom.
So far I have no significant complaints with this camera. It handles well, the focus speed is amazing, even in pretty low light levels, and the features and user interface are quite intuitive. The image quality is very good, way better than my last digicam, and the HD video capability rocks too. It is more bulky than I expected, and might be an issue for people with small hands, but the weight and overall feel are just right.
It will be a while before I get a chance to use even half the options and functions it offers, but it should be fun trying.
My only real gripe is that I had to buy this camera online, sight unseen. I could not find a retailer in CT that stocked it, so I had to buy it from a dealer like Best Buy that would take it back if it was a disappointment. Luckily, it performs as promoted, if not better.
Put this camera on the shelf so that people can put their hands on it Best Buy, it's a winner!

..

34687513 This is an amazing camera for any person who wants to get serious and creative with photography without or before moving up to a DSLR, or a DSLR owner who wants to travel light. This camera provides great image quality, that shouldn't leave anybody with reasonable expectations disappointed. Granted this isn't actually a DSLR camera with an advanced chip, so the image quality obviously won't be DSLR quality. But don't be fooled, this camera has great pictures that won't disappoint.
This camera has a lot of features such as effects filters, film simulation, an "advanced feature" that provides easy to use filters and options, in-camera cropping, exposure bracketing, and other options as well. Some of the Advanced Features allow photographers to take a "Pro-Focus" picture which is taking a picture of a sharp object with a soft and blurred background that only DSLRs were previously capable of. Pro-Low Light takes very low-noise images in dark settings with sharp image clarity. Both features work extremely well.
The Image quality is sharp. It photographs birds and wildlife very well. Messing with the settings can allow you to make colors pop, which is very important to me. The autofocusing is extremely fast and the best AF I've used in a camera in this class. The thirty second shutter speed allows you to take some pictures of the stars and astrophotography (which I also am interested in), but anybody looking to do serious astrophotography should invest in a DSLR and true wide-angle lens to get amazing results.
I enjoy photographing nature a great deal, and this camera is well-equipped for that. I have not used the auto-landscape settings because I'm an all manual guy, but I assume those could yeild great results too. I've had this camera for a month and I've been able to photograph all kinds of birds-even humming birds in flight! The lightning quick autofocus allow photographers to take exposures of that callibur. There is a manual focus ring too, just like on DSLRs for those that want to learn or who just want to have freedom focusing manually. I often find myself switching between the two depending on the photo-op. The biggest feature on this camera that allows it to stand out is it's 24-1000mmfocal-lengths. You can't get that in many DSLR lenses! My only qualm about the lens is that it's not a fixed-aperture lens, otherwise it's a fine lens!
My only issue I have with the whole camera is the noise reduction and control. Noise is noticable at ISO 3200. The noise reduction in-camera controls reduces noise, but it also softens the exposure and some details. But unless you are going to be cropping images to 100% and trying to look at the tiniest object in your image that's as far away as it could possibly be, that won't be an issue for you.
This camera also has a hotshoe that allows to attach flash and an external microphone for anybody capturing video. I have not used the video recording, for I use a camcorder for that, but what I can say I like about this camera is that there is an option for recording slow-motion. I know most Fujifilms record in a format other than AVCHD so I don't know if this model does or not.
In short this camera provides stunning image quality with an ultra great zoom range with fast auto-focusing and a manual focus ring for professionals. Fujifilm is kinda the shy kid in the corner that has potential to deliver amazing things, and this camera is an example of one of those possibilites. I definitely recomend this camera to any photographer wanting to travel light or a photographer trying to advance from a point-and-shoot and may consider getting a DSLR in the future. This camera will last anybody a long time and will please anybody. While the camera, like any other camera, has its shortcomings, I feel that what the camera does well more than makes up for what it could perform better at. Hopefully you can fall in love with this camera to and helps you make your decision regarding what camera to purchase.

..

34687513 I am not a professional photographer, I just use the camera for taking family and sporting event pictures. The camera takes great pictures and has an incredible 42x manual zoom. You can take pictures while doing a video. I had a Canon Powershot that could do this but the video was interrupted and it put the shudder sound in the video. That is not the case with this camera. If you turn off the camera sounds there is nothing noticeable in the video that you took a picture. The camera has a 1/2" sensor which is still small compared to a DSLR but is a little larger than 1/2.3" sensor found in most mega-zoom P&S cameras. The camera starts up fast and has very little shutter lag between pictures. Using the flash hardly slows the camera down. The battery life is exceptional. I would highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a higher end mega-zoom P&S.

This Fujifilm FinePix S4800 BLACK digital camera features OIS (optical image stabilization) to capture vibrant, blur-free photos through a Fujinon lens with reduced image distortion. The 720p HD video mode makes it easy to record high-quality footage.Memory card sold separately.


..

34687513 I am no professional photographer- just looking for a new decent camera. First of all, I can't stand that it takes disposable AA batteries- what a waste of money there. It does not come with a memory card, and there's no internal memory, so not knowing that, I was stuck with a new camera at Christmas with no way to take pictures. On top of that, it takes TERRIBLE pictures. There are very few features/options and the quality is just awful. I understand this is more of a "bargain" camera, but I guess you get what you pay for.

34687513 This is my second Fuji camera. I still have the original which works but wanted to upgrade from 4 megapixel to the 16, that tells you how old it is. For a first time shooter it comes out of the box ready to point and shoot and has enough toys "aperture, shutter speed etc." to play with for those more advanced. The software that downloads your pics from the camera is very easy to use and installed with no issues. I do wish it had more options for the quality of pic like my old camera. This one has 2 settings, good and best.. I just like a little more versatility in that area. The only negative would be the lens cap and the way it attaches to the lens. The removal buttons that have to be squeezed together to unlock it from the camera are in the middle of the cap and is a little awkward to pinch together. Over all I would buy this camera again and recommend it to others that wanted one for trips or at home events. Very Good Camera.

Preserve special moments with this Fujifilm FinePix S6800 RED 16.0-megapixel digital camera that features face and blink detection to enable stunning portraits of loved ones. Sensor-shift optical image stabilization ensures blur-free handheld shots.


..

34687513 I only had the camera for two weeks when the lens jammed. Apparently there is a problem with the lens when camera is turned on and the lens cap is covering lens. I turned the camera off, removed the lens cap. When the camera was turned on again, the lens jammed, when the camera was reset, the lens proceeded to go all the way out and not retract.
I sent it to Fuji for repair as requested by their warrenty, camera has very good quality and is really easy to use.
Will review again after repair.

..

34687513 This camera handles easily and takes a broad range of pictures but it does take a bit of time and experimentation to learn everything the camera offers.

..

34687513 I really like the camera, it will be great for capturing a lot of shots quickly.

..

34687513 I bought this to take photos for my business. It takes wonderful photos and is relatively easy to use once you familiarize yourself with it's features. The picture quality is outstanding. The Macro setting works extremely well. I can't say this is better than a Nikon Coolpix; I think they are about even in features and quality. I'd use personal preference & price to decide between the two. The coolpix MIGHT be slightly easier to use, but it all depends on how in-depth you read the manuals. Know your camera & you'll be happy!

This Garmin VIRB Elite 010-01088-10 action camera features a built-in GPS, accelerometer and altimeter that enable a range of present and custom recording profiles and add useful data to your videos. The 16.0MP 1/2.3" CMOS sensor ensures vibrant images.


..

34687513 I bought this camera after a great deal of research and comparison between the Garmin and GoPro. What it came down to for me was:
1) GPS integration
2) ease of use
3) battery life
The GPS was a no-brainer, I want to know where I did all of these cool things and be able to seamlessly integrate that information into the final video. I am not one of these people who post everything I do in life on You Tube; the videos I create are for me and those I choose to share them with, so I take the time to edit together a good product. The GPS data was essential for me, and I am a big fan of Garmin GPS products.
Ease of use - one big slide switch on the side of the unit and you are recording! This camera came out of the box with almost every setting I wanted as the default. The menu system is intuitive and the buttons are easy to press but won't get pressed accidently. The display works great in direct sunlight and draws almost no battery power.
Speaking of battery, how can you beat 2-1/2 hours of record time? The built in battery saving features such as recording when moving or only when going downhill are fantastic and go a long way to extending battery life but....you have to have GPS for that; see point 1 above.
In addition, the ability to add more sensors (heart rate, temp, cadence, power, etc.) makes this a versatile and worthwhile investment. I bought this primarily for cycling and have had a couple of good rides with it, but the first really cool use was rafting Browns Canyon in Colorado on June 6, 2014. I had the camera in the dive case, more for physical protection than water protection, and it performed flawlessly! Big switch allowed me to turn off and on when I wanted and be sure it was off or on, not guessing with a push button. Look out for Slydell's Suckhole.
Folks, all I will ask is do your own research, but I will tell you to get a Garmin Virb Elite, I dont think you will be dissapointed.

..

34687513 I use this mainly for cycling and must say it works very well. I also have the Garmin Edge 1000 and the ability to use my remote with both pieces of equipment is a really nice touch. I like the compact size. Be aware that the unit does not come with a mount for your bicycle. It is a twenty-five dollar option. I wish Garmin made a carrying case specifically for the Virb. As far as action cameras go I think it is on par with the Go Pro Hero Blacik.

..

34687513 Reasonably intuitive set up and use...more so than what I experienced with a Go Pro.
Ideal for cycling but great for any situation. Integration with Edge 810 cycling computer also provides info on heart rate, cadence, speed, and more as an overlay on the video.
Battery performance was not very good on first ride...but I was constantly stopping to change settings!
Second ride battery performance was great...just left it alone! 1.5 hour ride used about half of battery.
I like it and I'm glad I didn't get a Go Pro instead!

Shoot stunning photos and videos with this GE Power PRO Series X550 digital camera, which features a 16.1-megapixel CCD sensor that lets you capture clear, vibrant images. The electronic viewfinder allows real-time photo composition.Memory card sold separately.


..

34687513 We love the camera! We bought it for a road trip and got killer deal! We are very satisfied with the purchase.

..

34687513 Picture quality isn't worth paying for and after about a week of only using it twice the automatic and manual setting didnt work and I never dropped it

..

34687513 I find this camera's digital focus hard to master, and I realize this camera has only the slightest of professional features, however because this camera is excellent for producing clear, sharpe images, I say it is a great first time buy. I'd allow anyone to use the camera because it is easy to operate, durable and handy, comfortable to carry, and only requires new batteries for continued service.
I print my digital pictures on a business printer, use glossy paper, and man, the results are great ! I reccommend photo-editing software to achieve the best printed pictures. Simply chose Auto-fix option, than send it off to the printer. The cost of this camera is very affordable between $100.00 to $130.00, allowing for $100..00 to $150.00 for a printer upgrade.
Making a video is a snap, the videos have good sound I produce somewhat unsteady picture. I reccommend purchasing a camera tripod stand to mount the camera for producing the best pictures and videos. A steady aim is needed for pictures and videos.
I'm happy with this camera and love the idea of producing personal pictures and placing those as my desktop without using photo-editing software of any kind.

..

34687513 This camera is great. Easy to figure out. Takes excellent pictures. And priced way below other brands. Don't hesitate....this is a steal. The eye view option saves the battery life too. :) I was worried about it arriving in time for a wedding I was attending.....customer service was FANTASTIC.

..

34687513 I returned this camera after 1 day. The picture quality is very poor. Do not be fooled by its large "Professional Photographer camera" look. It was very big and bulky for its quality. My previous camera which was much smaller and thinner took much better pictures.

..

34687513 DO NOT BUY this camera it is useless,picture blurry on half my shoots,zoom is worst all shoots where blurry and unseable,shuuter speed slow,my nieces cell phone takes a better picture. checked manual and still blurry. what piece of junk

..

34687513 love the camera so easy to use the price was right. so far I love everything about it. Takes great pic.

..

34687513 So far, a really great camera.
The best option is to use Rechargeable Nimh Batteries.
You can buy Duracell Value Charger With 4AA Pre Charged Rechargeable Nimh Batteries, CEF14DX4
or Energizer Value Charger with AA Rechargeable Batteries, 4 Batteries Included,
and the problem is solved, it's ok for around 350 pictures.
Forget the alkaline batteries, it's ok for around 150 pictures only.
Don't forget to buy a good SDHC card, the SanDisk Extreme HD Video 16 GB SDHC Class 10 Memory Card (SDSDRX3-016G-A21) is a good option.

..

34687513 I wanted an inexpensive camera with the functionality of an SLR minus the cost. I am very pleased with my new camera. The photos are sharp and not blurry. I haven't used the advanced features just yet. Great price for a camera that takes photos like a pro! I highly recommend it!

..

34687513 I started to use it and I'm very happy with the cost benefit of this camera. Let's see if my opinion will be the same after some more months using it.

Easily prepare excellent steaks and more with this indoor grill that features a searing function that cooks meat at 500 to lock in flavor. The removable drip tray catches excess runoff for healthier meals.


..

34687513 nice indoor grill, cook everything great so far. really like the sear function. could use a splatter shield around it somehow and make the grills removable for cleaning. the cleaning instructions aren't great. otherwise i like it but needs improving.

..

34687513 Good product+Good dealer=satisfied customer- that's me!!! :-)

Mix up your favorite smoothies and shakes with this Hamilton Beach 51102 blender that includes two 14-oz. jars, so you can make a delicious drink for yourself and a friend. The travel lids make it easy to take a beverage on the go.


..

34687513 Don't know how long it will last but so far this is the gadget for me.

..

34687513 Great for quick fruit smoothies and taking it on the go if needed.

..

34687513 Works great. Excited that you can have ice and fruits in it

..

34687513 It is a great small blender and easy to use. I use it for smoothies

..

34687513 quality is good good for the price. Just remember to put some more water or milk before putting fruits.

..

34687513 I have enjoued the conveinence of this blender. It is lightweight and very easy to use and clean.

..

34687513 I got my blender for just under $14 after taxes. It was on sale for $17.99 and I had $5 in Rewards Points. I recently started working out so I needed something to make my protein shakes. Before I was using a mechanical food chopper to make my shakes and each time would take around 15 to 20 minutes having to chop up each ingredient individually and then manually shake the drink container for what seemed like forever. That was a huge waste of time. So far it's been working great. I can make great smoothies and protein shakes in just a few minutes. I love that I can mix up a smooothie, detatch the cup and enjoy my drink straight away. The jar / cup is made of thick durable plastic, holds up pretty well, and fits 14 fl oz . It fits in the cup holder of my vehicles just fine and is very easy to clean. Use caution if you have big hands when cleaning because the mixing blades at the bottom are part of the cup and you could probably hurt yourself if not careful. I have small hands so it's not really an issue for me. The base of the blender is very small and there's a spot where you can wrap the power cord around the base for easy storage. It does emit an odor typical to when motors are under a heavy load. It hasn't been an issue though. I never blend for more than 20 seconds at a time to let it cool down. I pulse blend until everything is nice and chopped up. Even if this thing fails I will buy another one because it was so cheap. There is another model made by Hamilton Beach that comes in different colors and is slightly thinner. If you want different colors, get the other model. This one only comes in black but they do also have this model that comes with a stainless steal cup which is slightly more expensive. I love my blender though and I'm about to make another shake right now!

..

34687513 I love this little blender. It does a great job with store bought smoothie mixes. It doesn't take up much space, so I can leave it out on the counter and cleanup is easy because of its small size.

..

34687513 I bought this for my daughter who makes a smoothy daily. She loves it!

..

34687513 I love its easy to handle ! I can take it to work for my morning
smoothie.

Enjoy a wide range of toasting and cooking options with this Hamilton Beach 31809 6-slice toaster oven that features convection, bake, broil, toast and stay-on settings for versatility and a timer that allows you to keep track of cook times.


..

34687513 I have this oven for almost a month now, and I love it using it almost every day. It bakes fast, when you want toasts on the go! It heats quite well, especially with the convection feature. What's more -- it does not heat up the kitchen or surrounding area, where most other toaster ovens do when in use. It is compact, fits well between the cupboards and counter, and wide enough to fit a 12" pizza!

This Hamilton Beach Big Mouth Duo Plus 70580 2-speed food processor features a 500-watt motor to powerfully slice, shred, chop, puree and mix your foods. The Big Mouth feed chute reduces the need to pre-cut food.


..

34687513 I chose these processor over all the others I researched because it had the two different sized bowls and the reviews.

..

34687513 My wife absolutely loves it. The smaller bowl is great for little jobs and makes cleanup easier

Enjoy homemade juice with this juice extractor that features a Big Mouth feed chute to reduce the need to pre-cut food.


..

34687513 I was just looking for a basic juicer and this one fits the bill. It comes apart easily for cleaning, however the filter is somewhat difficult to clean. It has been great so far.

..

34687513 TRYING THIS AND WORKS FINE. OF COURSE YOU DONT WANT TO STUFF EVERYTHING THAT'S BIG AND DONT FORCE IT SO IT DOESNT BREAK!

..

34687513 I was looking for an inexpensive juicer since did I want to invest in a more expensive one. Pulls juice of out fruits and veggies easily and to the max. The pulp that remains is dryer than that of other juicers I've tried. Easy to set up and easy to clean. I have recommended to several friends.

..

34687513 Xcellent product for the price,only complaint is i don't fell like I get most of the juice out of certain things like fruit but for the value it's a great juicer!!!

..

34687513 I wanted to start off small for my first juicer and after reading all of its reviews, I decided to go with this one. Everything was great until it stopped working a few weeks after I purchased it. I'm guessing it was the motor that went. I didn't want to buy another one, I upgraded to the Breville juicer( the one in the Joe Cross documentary-fat, sick and nearly dead) and I haven't had any issues thus far.

..

34687513 We bought this 2 months ago, and still have a blast making new juices and coming up with new recipes! This thing rocks

..

34687513 I love my juicer, it works great and cleans up easy.

..

34687513 This juicer is very easy to use and assemble. I love it!

..

34687513 I have made many different types of juice! Great flavor!

..

34687513 Great product for the price. Very well satisfied except that it is bulkier than we thought.

They say breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Unfortunately, mornings are hectic for most people, especially families with children. So how do you cope with hunger pangs at breakfast time? If you're like most people, you have to rush through the meal, gobble down whatever's handy in the kitchen, or grab a quick, on-the-go bite.That's where the Breakfast Sandwich Maker by Hamilton Beach comes to the rescue. It's all about making a fresh breakfast sandwich you can grab and go. Just choose your bread and layer on the fixings: egg, cheese, precooked meat, or the ingredients of your choice. In five minutes or less, your perfectly assembled breakfast sandwich is ready to eat. You can customize your breakfast sandwich with a practically endless variety of fresh ingredients. Now you know why everyone who loves breakfast sandwiches wants this product in their kitchen!


..

34687513 Cool machine...fun to use....one step process without making a mess in the kitchen....kids love it!

..

34687513 The maker works wonderfully in making english muffins with eggs, cheese and any meat (sausage patties work best). Has it for three months. But, this week it just stopped working. Nothing happened. Just stopped working. Will try to get warranty repair, but as this price, not sure if it's worth mailing it in.

..

34687513 Great for a quick hot breakfast on the go
Great space saver.
Easy to assemble . Quick cleanup.

..

34687513 I can't say anything negative because it really is a useful item

..

34687513 I would recommend this sandwich maker to everyone.
It came highly recommend to me.

..

34687513 Great and easy way to make breakfast sandwiches. I have no problems with it and will be purchasing more for gifts!

..

34687513 This is a great buy! it is a great sandwich maker that is very easy to use and you can make a great breakfast sandwich in a matter of 5 minutes. It is easy to clean as well. I simply love it!

..

34687513 This is the easiest small kitchen appliance to use PLUS it makes a great sandwich.

..

34687513 This is a cool way to make an egg mc muffin & know the ingredients are what you want & not some processed junk. You do need to wait a few minutes between sandwiches because the heat for the egg drops. Will have to leave the top up for a couple minutes so the egg will cook & the bread won't burn.
My 7 year old grandson thought it was neat so this gets a thumbs up!

..

34687513 My husband loves this product. He makes breakfast sandwiches for all of us and they are delicious. He wishes that they would make a double sandwich maker.

Brew and pour delicious coffee easily with this coffeemaker that features carafe-free dispensing for simple, 1-hand pouring, as well as gentle warming to maintain the coffee's temperature.


..

34687513 It's just an ok coffee maker. Looks and feels cheap. The bottom rubber stoppers keep falling off. Had to use "super glue" to finally keep them on.
After making the coffee. Sounds like a steak sizzling on the grill.

..

34687513 in a house with small children it comes in handy. i can wake up to coffee, there is not a pot that the kids can grab and/ or break, it shuts off after two hours (which in useful for when i am trying to get kids out the door and might forget about the coffee maker), and the out side does not get very hot with helps because two of the kids in the house are about 4 ft tall and sometimes grab stuff.

..

34687513 I have to agree with everything the other individual said who wrote a review for this product. Its a nice design but that is about it. It didn't last longer than 4 months and we experienced the same problem; the coffee just stopped brewing. We could also hit the start button numerous times but shortly thereafter, the appliance went out completley. I rate this one star because it is not worth the money. I am going to try the Hamilton Beach BrewStation 12 cup coffee maker for $10 more this time since the reviews seem descent.

..

34687513 I am on my 3rd one and it's about to go. I have been buying this maker for a few years. I prefer the carafe-free design. I don't want an expensive single cup brewer. All 3 have malfunctioned in the same way. They just start shutting off about half way through the brewing process. You can restart them for a while but they finally just go completely. This latest one lasted a little over 1 year. At least they give me a little advanced warning so I have time to get another one. I think I am finally moving on....3rd time wasn't a charm.

..

34687513 
Serve delicious cups of coffee to your guests with this Hamilton Beach BrewStation 47900 coffeemaker that features a carafe-free design and 1-handed dispensing for simple use. The warming heater maintains your coffee's temperature for optimal flavor.


..

34687513 This is our third Hamilton Beach Coffee Maker. We love the no carafe design. The old one was working fine, but slow, and we had let it get pretty gunked up, so decided that at the $40 price we could make the purchase of a new one. We especially like the container that you fill with water and then just "plug" in to the unit. That was my only complaint on the old model - too many spills and a narrow slot to pour water in. The new coffee maker has solved this problem and still has the other features we loved on the old one.

..

34687513 I am very satisfied with this coffee maker, it is easy to operate and makes good coffee. It is pleasant to the eyes . I am dissapointed that I cannot clean the internal parts, filter basket and coffee chamber in the Dishwasher, but it is still a good unit for my purposes.

..

34687513 The settings are easy to do. The lift off and fill tank are great and easy to put on and off. I like the flat bottom filters. Easy to fill. The dispenser makes it fast and easy to get that first cup in the morning. No mess!

..

34687513 Easy to fill the water container; easy to fill your cup with no glass carafe to break; keeps coffee hot (you can program it to stay warm up to 4 hours).
We love it soooo much we bought a second one to have as a backup just in case something happens to it. Usually when I find a product I love and I have to replace it, it' slither been modified or discontinued. Didn't want to risk that with this great coffee pot!

..

34687513 Will not last long. Cheap plastic. Took 10 loads to get the plastic taste out.
Side fill is very good feature.
I would pay a lot more for a complete unit made out of stainless steel!
Design is very good!

..

34687513 Great coffeemaker. Easy to use and looks good on the counter. Sleek design.

..

34687513 This is a great coffee pot for the price. No worries of a carafe, just fill your cup and go.

..

34687513 THIS IS A GREAT COFFEE POT- I BOUGHT THE EARLIER VERSION AND USED IT TIL I BROKE THE HINGE OFF THE LID- I WAS REALLY GLAD TO SEE THERE WAS A NEWER VERSION THAT IS MORE DURABLE AND EVEN EASIER TO USE THAN THE OLD VERSION. NO MORE POTS TO LIFT OUT AND POUR- JUST PLACE YOUR CUP OR LARGE TUMBLER AND AS EASY AS 1-2-3 COFFEE IS IN IT WITHOUT ANY MESS!!

..

34687513 No pot to clean or burn. Makes good coffee. Like the removable water tank. Coffee could be a little hotter, but overall happy.

..

34687513 Easy to use. I really like the water reservoir, not too many things to take apart early in the morning. Makes good coffee for price. I mainly bought it for the dispenser, great for grabbing a cup out the door.

Hamilton Beach ChefPrep 70610 Food Processor - 10 Cup (Capacity) - 2 Speed - 500 W Motor - White


..

34687513 Was looking for a replacement processor. This was an excellent option for the price. Large capacity, high speed and enough blade choices to meet most needs.

..

34687513 Love< love , makes my prep time so easy no more chopping or shredding by hand anymore! Which is great for my sore arthritic hands

..

34687513 
The one-touch pulse control and powerful stainless-steel blades of this compact food chopper make it easy for you to chop, mix and mince a variety of foods and prepare purees. The dishwasher-safe bowl, lid and blades offer fast cleanup.


..

34687513 I wanted a chopper that could chop up vegetables or fruit. I put in the slices of vegetables as indicated in the guide and it seemed to dice and chop very quickly and well, however the food that was near the bottom turned into baby food. Not really what I'm looking for, but it does what it's supposed to. My first experience with a processor btw. It does seem to be very good quality for the price though.

Designed for use with ground coffee and most K-Cup packs, this Hamilton Beach FlexBrew 49995 single-serve coffeemaker features enhanced coffee extraction for rich flavor and an adjustable cup rest for brewing into your favorite cup or travel mug.


..

34687513 Like many people, I got this as a replacement for a dead Keurig. I looked at a lot of machines out there, and I was specifically looking for something that could brew K-cups, coffee grounds or coffee soft pods. Most of the machines that could do this were expensive ($100+). This product though, it's only half that, and it can do the same thing, and it does the same thing very well.
One nice thing about the Keurig was that it was very fast, as it pushed the hot water through with a good amount of pressure. This resulted in a quick brew, no doubt, but when using my own coffee grounds, it was not very easy to find the perfect sweet spot that made GOOD coffee. K-cups, they were usually perfect.
This unit, however, is the slightly slower 'drip' method, and instead of ~1.0 min for a cup from one of the Keurig model, this one takes ~2.0 mins for a cup. However, because the water has contact with the coffee for substantially longer, the coffee made with my own grounds is absolutely better with this machine than the Keurig. The K-cups are just as good, no better or worse than a Keurig machine (which is a good thing).
So, what it boils down to is that the coffee takes maybe a minute longer to brew, but it does so with the drip technique rather than the forced-water technique. This results in the same taste for K-cups, but BETTER taste when brewing your own coffee. And unlike the Keurig, you don't have to buy a separate piece of equipment to use your own coffee grounds. Also, you get the added bonus (over the Keurig) of being able to buy/use coffee soft pods, which is awesome. Much like the K-cup world, there are a lot of coffee soft pod makers out there with some fantastic coffees in ready-to-go little pods.
End result, I'm actually extremely satisfied and a little surprised by this great little machine. I don't have any negative things to say about the Keurig, but honestly, this seems just as good, for less money, and more functionality.

34687513 Xmas gift purchase online during a good sale, so the "value for price" rating is excellent. Even at regular price, it would still be "good" simply because it brews a great cup of coffee and costs substantially less then Keurig. Really like the ability to also brew ground coffee with the basket insert. K-cups can be pricey to use constantly.

..

34687513 didnt want to pay the big price of a keurig coffee maker. This is excellent for doing the same thing at a much less expensive price.

..

34687513 Bought this on sale and very happy with it. Love that you can brew k-cups and regular coffee with this unit. I like the fact that the water is not stored and that you have to fill it with the water needed before each brew. It takes about 2 minutes from fill of water to drinking coffee which I am fine with. I also love that it auto shuts off once done brewing and it's extremely easy to use! The slim design is great for kitchens with small spaces or even at a desk in your office if your boss is not picky about that type of thing.

..

34687513 Wanted a pod brewer that also could make regular coffee. After some online review reading, I thought this would be my answer. It's slow. I'll keep using my regular Mr. Coffee maker to make 2-4 cups. Maybe use this for guests who want to try some "pod variety" coffees, or a cup of tea.

..

34687513 I bought this for my college student and he really enjoyed it, until last night when after a month and a half of use it started chewing up the k-cups and just giving him water instead of coffee.

..

34687513 I was looking for a single cup brewer and after looking for a long time, I decided to just go with a pricey Keurig. But just before I bought one, I looked again and found this one! I like brewing fresh coffee and wanted the option of using K-cups as well. This does both superbly! I know there are some negative comments about a couple things, but if you follow directions correctly like it says, then you will have no problems. I've had mine for a while now and brewed both ways and haven't had one issue.

..

34687513 I purchased this brewer due to it's use of multiple filters for K cups or my own ground beans. The filter for ground coffee worked well, but the K cup holder had a horrid plastic smell and taste. I ran hot water through the system a dozen times, put it in the dishwasher a couple times, soaked it in CLR, then sodium bicarb, and still could not get rid of the smell and taste. This pretty much killed the whole idea of using the K cups.
On top of that, the water reservoir was only large enough for one cup, and the filter system leaked condensed water all over.
It is a great idea, poorly executed.

..

34687513 Since my husband and I are up a different times, having this product
ensures us both of having a fresh cup of coffee. We can use the
K cups or our own choice of coffees.

..

34687513 I drink a lot of coffee, I drink a good cup first from kcups, then I use regular coffee maker for the rest of my coffee.

This Hamilton Beach Set & Forget 33969 slow cooker features full-grip handles for easy portability. An oval design with a 6-quart capacity accommodates up to a 6-lb. chicken or up to a 4-lb. roast.


..

34687513 I sent this to my mom for Mother's Day and she loves it! She had never cooked using a slow cooker before but wanted to cut down her time in the kitchen every night and she is really enjoying this! She especially loves the meat thermometer that can be used without even opening the lid. I'm thinking of getting one of these for myself now!
Added bonus: Ships free to Anchorage, AK...that's VERY RARE. Way to go, Best Buy!

..

34687513 The looks are great. Capacity substantial, Cooking takes longer than expected. First couple of hours wonder if it is working. After a few hours there is life.

..

34687513 The cooked beef is really good! No need to worry about timing.

..

34687513 Bought as a gift for my wife's birthday, she likes kitchen gadgets and our daughter in-law had received one for Christmas and my wife appeared to want one as a replacement for an older basic Rival slow cooker we had for years. She used it yesterday to cook a pork roast and the unit cooked the roast in about half the time as the older Rival unit and when it reached the set internal temperature the slow cooker dropped down to warming temperature. The shorter cooking time may be due to the lid's tighter seal, where the lid on the older Rival unit did have some slight gaps that leaked more vapors. The Hamilton-Beach slow cooker does have the feature that the lid can be latched in placed to travel with the slow cooker when bringing food to a party or pot-luck get-together.

..

34687513 We have made a Pot Roast, Lamb Shanks and my Wife made a dump cake, and everything came out great. Thank You

..

34687513 I wanted this crockpot to handle a large chicken. You can set it for the cook time and when it's done, it switches to warm so that your food does not overcook. It also stores nicely inside my cabinets, so it's always handy.

..

34687513 We had 1 similar to this that my wife wore out. So when I went to replace it, I couldn't find one that had all of the options that the other one had until I found this one. I could not believe that it was so hard to find a nice affordable programmable crockpot in the size she liked!
Not only was this one stainless steel, it was one quart bigger than her last one and needless to say she was ecstatic about this crockpot!

..

34687513 I've had this slow cooker for about a month and so far I like it very much. It's easy to program and use, and works as well as any slow cooker I've ever had. I like having the option of just turning it on and using it like a more conventional crock pot.
The lid locks seem like they would be nice if I wanted to take the slow cooker with me to a potluck or something, but I haven't tried this so I can't say how well that works. I also haven't tried the temperature probe, so I can't say anything about how useful (or not) that is.
I can't say much about the durability because a month isn't long. So far there are no problems, and the only reason I haven't rated this higher is because I haven't owned it that long. It's kind of stupid for Best Buy to ask for a review after such a short time if they want information about the durability.

..

34687513 This is the first crock pot I have owned, but I have used many other previously and I have to say this one is awesome! I love how easy it is to use, being able to program the temp and cook time is great also! I can set the crock pot to cook while I'm at work, once the it's finished cooking for the set time, it automatically turns itself down to warm so your food doesn't over cook or get cold. It comes with a spoon and meat thermometer.
The only thing I'm not a huge fan of are, it's a little bulky with the handles sticking out and they are not collapsible. I like that the lid can be locked down, but it can be hard to get the hooks on and off of the lid.
Otherwise it has been great so far! I definitely would recommend this crock pot to anyone!

..

34687513 Easy to use with plenty of features. Used it for the first time last week. Set the timer and left. When time expired, it switched to "warm" mode. Food came out hot and tasted great.

Make a fruit smoothie or a delicious shake with this single-serve blender that features stainless-steel blades for durability. The travel lid allows you to take your drink with you on the go.


..

34687513 I love this little blender for my morning smoothie. I wish it was a little more powerful. I try to be mindful of what it can and can't handle. It is only a pulse blend. I would recommend this for beginners.

..

34687513 This unit is pretty awesome when I want to blend a quick smootie or shake. I own a $400 blendtec that was gifted to me, but this $20 gadget will get the job done and its very fast and easy to clean since you can drink right out of the cup. Get one and youll be happy just make sure to put in crushed ice cubes so you dont over heat the unit.

..

34687513 Simple and Superb blender! Perfect gift for mom! Easy to handle, clean and makes milkshakes in minutes

..

34687513 this one was a replacement for an old blender that engaged whenever the mixing bowl was pushed in to the base....The gears were made of plastic and eventually wore down to the gumline...
onto this new blender, this is great because it has on/off switch which won't wear down the gears....hoopefully will last 5 years like the first one.....

..

34687513 good for the price
actually, it's durable, cute, easy to clean, and work great.
If you want to blend soy beans, make sure blend thoroughly(2mins)

..

34687513 I received mine through the rewards center of my credit card company. I've used it a few times so far and it is a great little product. Whips up smoothies in no time flat and very easy to clean than the bigger blenders.

Hamilton Beach 33182 Slow Cooker - 2 gal


..

34687513 I love the size and easy to use. I cooked a full turkey breast that came out so tender and moist

..

34687513 Bought this to cook whole chickens. Works great for this purpose. Meat falls off the bone. Has only a simple low, med, high knob so there is no digital parts that could break. It has a nice built in lid holder that is useful when because the built up steam on the lid drips back into the pot instead of having to place the lid on the counter and dirtying it.

..

34687513 overall, we are pleased with the product and the store, fast service.

..

34687513 Great product for a very good price. 8 guart is big enough to cook just about anything. I wish it had a timer but that's no big deal.

..

34687513 Very nice crock pot. The large size allows to make meals that will feed a family or last me for a long time. Not much else to say about it, although the drip handle/tool feature is good in thought but not really usable or practical. If you use it, the lid does hang into the pot for condensation to drip back into the pot but most of the time the crock will be fairly full and now you getting the lid down into whatever it is you are cooking.

..

34687513 I have used this so many times and it does heat up the food in minutes not hours like some of the other brands I had in the past.
Very Happy with this purchase.

..

This dishwasher-safe, 6-speed hand mixer has a maximum power of 300 watts and includes a Quick Burst button for convenience. The brushed stainless-steel housing and classic styling coordinate with many kitchen interiors, and the snap-on storage case helps keep attachments organized.


..

34687513 The mixer is very portable. I always have the beater attachments with the mixer. The cord also fits nicely in the storage bin along with the attachments. It is easy to clean. I really like the coated beaters that I can use in my glass mixing bowls. The speed control will mix anything quickly, I just wish it had a really slow option other than the pulse for gentle mixing. I think it is a great portable mixer for the money.

..

34687513 Bought this mostly because of the soft scrape beaters. I didn't know they made such a thing. I also like the storage it has, now won't have to search for the beaters. It can all be kept together.

..

34687513 Love it! It is so easy to store and no messy cords hanging out.

..

34687513 I liked this mixer, but as I stated it was too heavy for me. I needed something lighter, so I exchanged it for another model of Hamilton Beach, which suits me fine. Its lighter, and has all the same equipment, except for the dough hooks. I will buy these on my own. Other than that, everything is great!!

..

34687513 Very happy with my purchase of this mixer I would recommend to anyone needing a hand mixer.

..

34687513 Seems good so far. I'm curious how long it will last, but otherwise very pleased.

..

34687513 I love how everything fits in the bottom container

Hamilton Beach Toastation 22708 Two Slice Toaster Oven - Toast, Bake - Black


..

34687513 After downsizing to a smaller home I no longer had room for both a toaster and a toaster oven. Since I frequently use both I was thrilled to find this product. It works great and takes up about the same amount of space as my old 4 slice toaster did by itself.

..

34687513 This takes up barely more space than a regular pop-up toaster, yet the oven part is large enough for most one-meal needs. It's too small to cook a pizza, but great for smaller items. The pop-up feature for toast is also great. It makes better, more evenly browned toast than many toaster ovens I have used.

..

34687513 I have a small house and this toaster oven is the perfect combination. It toasts quickly and I can heat sandwiches etc. in the oven.

..

34687513 I reordered another item in red that I am now able to toast bagles. Also the item I originally ordered had a very small oven.

..

34687513 I like this toaster/oven because it is both a toaster and an oven. It is more convenient to toast bread in the top and when it's done it pops up instead of having to open the oven part and keep checking it.

..

34687513 I didn't expect the good performance until I used it 10s of times so far. Great product

..

34687513 I kinda needed a new toaster and found this at Best Buy.com.
Really loved the nostalgic look and it also has a toaster oven
which is really nice and quick to reheat pizza etc.

..

34687513 The toaster works fine but the oven is very small and fits only thin sandwiches or items to heat through.

..

34687513 The product is great, yet I should have ordered a 4 slot, not available at time of order, works great.

..

34687513 I do recommend this smaller toaster oven. It takes up a lot less space than a hugh one and we love having the choice of a pop up toaster, or the toaster oven in one appliance.

..

Blend your drink right in the glass with this 2-speed hand blender that features a blending wand and a stainless-steel power whisk for smooth blending and a comfortable handle and grip for easy handling.


..

34687513 When I opened the box, product was already damaged. It was scratched up with black marks. I like a lighter stick blender, this Hamilton Beach is too heavy. Buttons are located on top rather than in front. This makes it less user friendly. I don't recomend this product for a beginner.

..

34687513 The picture shows a whisk, blades, and a drink mixer. Be aware it does not actually come with the drink mixer. Other than that it works well.

..

34687513 This works great for mixing baby formula with the whisk, or whipping cream. Husband uses the blender attachment to make smoothies.

..

34687513 I bought this online. Looks and works fine as expected.

..

34687513 I would not recommend this product due to possible manufacturing quality issues. The description of the product was very good for a student, but I had to return this product after 2 days due to the computer not being able to bootup after being shutdown. Best Buy employee tried to start at the store, but was also unable to restart the computer. We traded it in for a laptop available at the store.

..

34687513 So far i am loving it! Crisp picture, east to set up and use!

..

34687513 I bought this for my granddaughter so she can fine tune her computer skills that she's learning at school, at home. Keyboarding at lower grade levels is a big thing now. The 18-5010 combines a nice size, bright screen with a compact all in one unit with a full size keyboard and mouse. It's AMD processor is not a powerhouse but provides enough power for web surfing, educational programs, movie watching including video streaming via a movie provider (we've been using NetFlix). Internet connection was easy and I've used the built in wi-fi and ethernet connections. The built in speakers sound good and it has 5 USB ports. My one complaint would be windows 8 which has nothing to do with the 18-5010. But the new operating system will require a learning curve and it will be fun learning with my granddaughter. She can probably teach this senior citizen a thing or two.

34687513 This item is a good buy. It is easy to use. The quality of the prints and copies are really good. I really enjoy being able to have a scanner and being able to sign and scan a document to a PDF file. I highly recommend this product.

34687513 I originally picked out the HP envy sleekbook but a best buy associate came across this laptop and its specs looked awesome. The only difference were positive ones other than it wasn't a touch screen and didn't have bluetooth capabilities. I could accept those things. I got it home and it took forever to start up and load. After taking the time to get it all set up I noticed two dead pixels and I was extremely disappointed. I played with it longer just to make sure this was what I wanted. The internet was very glitchy and the apps loaded but would flicker a lot. The screen resolution was awful. It is so dull and so hard to read compared to the other envy models. It also doesn't have a back lit keyboard and that is a huge negative in a dim room. Not at all impressed took it right back to the store and ordered the one I originally wanted.

..

34687513 I bought this laptop when it was $500 and I thought it was great, until I started getting to realize what junky it was. The first thing I had to do was install 81 updates. Then almost 30 of them failed to complete and still to this day won't give me the option to redo. Multiple drivers HP sends me for this laptop does NOT work! And will always cause multiple errors. I also tried updating to Windows 8.1 and it totally wrecked the laptop: I had to set it back to factory tuned. I do not recommend this laptop.

34687513 i have problem with my brand new HP Envy Recline 27" touch Computer.
right side of screen gets really hot...
i have envy recline 27" with i7 with 16gb, with 1 tb hybrid drive received on June 3rd, 2014 (my HP order# H129773079)
called the HP support on June 9th, 2014 with three transfers.
updated the bios per tech support, nothing still hot. he wanted to service / send in and fix my brand new envy, he says it will take about 3 weeks to get it back...
i told him i want a RMA number to return, i reminded him about the HP 21day return policy.
he says he made case (3003981260) and some one will call me back tomorrow, asked for best time to call.
i told him 12pm Pacific time. waited HP to call front of my computer from 11:45am ~ 12:30pm.
NO CALL, wasted my time....VERY UNHAPPY WITH HP....
can you fix this problem or is this how this computer is.
please let me know before i return it.
Update 6.14.2014
I also sent this message to, HP website, they have area where you can "send a email to CEO"
next day got a message from HP "I have escalated your issue to the appropriate team" we will contact you within 48hours
next 48 hours, I got a call, which I missed, HP left a message 800 number to call back, I called back and left a message again, yet to hear from them, I feel I'm not going to get a call from them again.
I'M returning this computer. because I don't think they have solution for my problem and this problem is not just mine, check internet for this problem, lots of people have problem I have, I think this is epidemic failure "design flaw" + they have terrible customer service.

34687513 The item is a little pricey and I don't understand why it had no internal DVD. The functionality of everything else is great

34687513 I purchased at Bestbuy.com and it was delivered in 3 days. The printer is easy to install and works flawlessly. Scanning is fast and easy. Would replace with similar printer when/if it fails.

..

34687513 The best of auto two-sided, laser, color, all-in-one printer.

..

34687513 This printer is primarily used for documents, flyers, etc. It was very easy to set up, but I did encounter a few issues with wireless. It easily prints from the network or from an iOS device. The quality is very good and there are a multitude of custom settings and apps that can be downloaded to the printer. In addition, the settings can be changed from the printer or from the web. All in all, a very good printer at a reasonable price.

..

34687513 I love this printer. In comparing this printer to others available, it had all the features I wanted without paying thousands of dollars. I would go through black ink quickly on my old inkjet printer and then when I wanted to print in color the cartridge would be drying up. The laser cartridges last so much longer and the printing is just beautiful. All features work exceptionally well from the printing, copying, scanning and faxing! I really like that this printer has two sided printing and it prints very quickly. My old inkjet would take forever to come out of sleep mode. This printer wakes very quickly so I don't have to wait for my print job to begin. It also holds a lot of paper. Very happy with my purchase!!

..

34687513 Fairly easy to set up. Easy to use. Got it on sale and then it was cheaper later on and they gave me credit for the difference.

..

34687513 Stopped working after 4 weeks of light use. We called HP, they sent a tech out to determine it is not repairable. I have been without a printer for 3 weeks and still waiting for a replacement. HP claims they are out of stock.

..

34687513 I am still learning and using all of the features. So far I have not found any issues with the printer.

..

34687513 Well here it goes.
I am using it in medical office as a second printer. After two month it started to make unbelievable scratchy sounds. I called HP and they said that does happen. Now I have to return it.
Bad thing about printer.
1- When you fax numbers when pressed are very slow and you will not see whole number on the screen because there is only 6 spaces
When I bought it I assumed that it will send faxes to the network folder no it does not do that or even does not forward fax to email address.
IF IT DID NOT MAKE CRAZY SOUND AND SCANNED FAXES TO THE NETWORK FOLDERS AND DID NOT EAT INK LIKE CRAZY IT WOULD BE NICE PRINTER

34687513 I've only owned two printers worth unpacking. This is one. today is 5/15/2014. Purchased this printer (HP LaserJet Pro 200 M251nw# Black Friday Week 2013. Not a single problem. All the other Printers should be so good. The only other printer I've ever used/owned as good or better - was a Canon PIXMA (small foot print) inkjet printer. You could set it up to print on any size paper that would load in just a couple of seconds and make the page print the way you wanted it to look with complete ease.
This HP printer prints clean too. No ink all over the place or on your hands. Thank you HP! Great job! Only 1 possible dislike - it's a big printer.

34687513 Great printer. Easy setup. Speedy printing. Highly recommend.

..

34687513 Clean & Fast Printing - Goes from standby mode to printing Very Fast! Nice capacity & runs large jobs very well.

..

34687513 This printer is a replacement for another HP LaserJet Printer that gave us great service for a number of years. This printer is faster and more efficient than the previous model.

..

34687513 I would recommend the Mobile 100. i purchase this item brand new, i could not load software, or get this printer to scan. The problem i had with the printer is spending over 300. to purchase this printer and can not get in to work. i call HP tech support they wanted to charge me 70.00 to get printer working i said hell no. that's why i recommend the 100.00

..

34687513 This printer scanner copier worked great for the basic functions we needed it for. The set up was easy and relatively hassle free. You can't change the default scan settings which is frustrating. The grayscale scanning option works the best for high quality scans with out the file size of color. We are very happy with our purchase

..

34687513 Can't help anyone looking for technical info, but it does what it's meant to very well for me. A lot of bang for the buck!

..

34687513 My husband and I bought this printer to take with us on vacation. We had a large printing project for his practice that we needed to complete and didn't want to wait until we returned home. This printer was perfect. Set up was easy and printing was quick for a portable product. It does feel a little flimsy. We will see how it holds up over time. Overall, great printer for travel.

..

34687513 This printer works with my galaxy captivate through blue tooth using the prinershare app and it also will save scanned copies to a thumb drive. As a business owner on the go it is the perfect companion.

..

34687513 I really like the style and portability of this printer. I use it for work away from home. I have not flown with it yet, but for traveling work while taking my car it is great. I believe that it will be great for traveling when I can not take my car as well.

..

34687513 I had to get this printer because my old printer was not compatible with windows 8. I am concerned with the rollers that grab the paper. They seem to slide on the paper before grabbing it. I doubt this printer will last very long.

..

34687513 Small and portable. serves my purpose well. the cost is a little bit on the high end.

..

34687513 Took awhile to get setup, as I had to download drive from HP for Windows 8. Bluetooth connection is a must, if you don't have it you will have to purchase a dongle to communicate with the printer or have a printer cable. Scanning is only available via printer cable. Easy of use, exceptional quality. Would recommend highly!

34687513 This printer fits me like a glove. It does everything I would want it to do-prints, copies, faxes, all very impressively.

34687513 I wish I would have notice how small an area this HP has. My last HP had a larger area in which I could scan in larger documents. I used the old one for years and years until it finally was not cost effective. Do not get me wrong this HP is good.

I believe they returned to HP

34687513 I absolutely love the new hp slate 8 pro! The aspect ratio is perfect on this size tablet. I became interested in this tablet because i had recently purchased an acer a1-810 and loved the viewing area. I liked the size so much i bought one for my sister for christmas. Then i saw the new slate 8 pro, had to get it. I do not regret it one bit! This tablet is great, with a better display than the ipad mini! The 1600x1200 display is crisp and sharp. The tegra 4 processor is smooth and fast. I even downloaded a few nvidia tegra 4 games for testing and they all run smooth as butter. Not to mention it currently is running the android 4.2.2 jelly bean operating system, with updates eventually to android 4.4 kitkat HOPEFULLY!!!!!! Updates are supposed to be coming more often and faster, because they are going to be sent via Nvidia...thanks to the included tegra 4 processor, instead of being sent by HP. Its supposed to be the same with the slate 7 extreme that comes with the tegra 4.
I am very impressed with the whole package on this tablet. In the past 5 years i have owned over a dozen tablets, and this is one of my favorites. It ranks in the top three along with the acer a700 and the a1-810, the acer a1 is in the mix because of its quad cores and it was so awesome for such a cheap price.
In the end, i highly recommend this tablet, from my experience, you would be hard pressed to find another high end 8 inch tablet
I love the 8" 4:3 aspect ratio on tablets. It makes viewing web pages perfect, especially at this size. I also have the 8 inch lenovo yoga but its just too difficult to view webpages on such a thin viewing screen.
The miracast wifi direct works great, it connected to my lenovo wd100 dongle on the first try, without any issues at all. It also connected flawlessly via bluetooth to my new hardon karmon bluetooth over the ear headphones.
You also get 25gb of cloud storage for free via box, curtousy of hp, it also works great. The cloud storage via acer cloud works great too. Sound is really great with the included beats audio.
No problems connecting at all via wi-fi, it connects via dual bands at 2.4ghz and at 5ghz without any issues whatsoever.
The tablet also has an hdmi port, even though most sites dont even list it as a available port. I like the way hp enclosed the sd card slot also, just seems to keep it safer from dust and debree. I also like the way the volume rocker is flush with the back so there isnt any accidental pressing...same as the power button too.
The slate 8 also has an included internal app for controlling the processor speed and power. There are three levels, maximum, balanced and power saver, on the power saver mode the processor only utilizes only 2 of the 4 available processors. On balanced it uses all four but limits the frames per second and at maximum it uses all 4 and lifts the frames per second limit. If you arent playing games or multi-tasking i have found that cutting back on the processor really saves your battery.
I do agree that the speakers would be better seperated on each side, not together as they are, when using tablet face up the speakers are both on bottom, but when you turn the tablet on its side both speakers are located on the right. But they do have really good sound for an 8 inch tablet. I dont use them that often though because i usually have bluetooth headphones on or have it connected to one of my soundfreaq sound step speakers i have situated throughout my house.
The hp brand case works real nice, but it does collect dirt real easy. I havent purchased the docking station for the slate line yet, i will ad to this feedback when i do.
Overall i really enjoy this tablet and feel that for the most part,hp did an excellent job. I really hope they give it the kitkat update. I was buying acer tablets but quite that because they never gave any of their tablets any decent updates. They did with earlier/oldr models but not on any of their newer tabs. So now i am giving hp a chance, and from the looks of this tablet, i am glad i did.
In the end, i highly recommend this tablet, from my experience, you would be hard pressed to find another high end 8 inch tablet with these specs at this price, that runs this smoothly, and from a name like hp. My amd a10 quad core gaming laptop is an hp, but my all in one is an acer. Those are currently my 2 favorite brands.
Sorryif my review is a little jumbled and short in areas, currently i am writing this while exercising on my stationary bike and watching supernatural on tv....lol. guess my resolution this year was to multi-task more, lol. If you are thinking about buying this tablet, do it, i guarantee you wont regret it! Good luck....and happy shopping!
P.S. when you first setup you new tablet you might find a few apps that seem to run a little slow, don't fret. This happens with all new tablets, it usually takes a few months for them to get the bugs out of their new model. It's normal, it even happens with the way over priced apple products. When I first bought the lenovo s6000, it took 4 months before the Netflix app would even work. Just remember, as long as the tablet is getting updates, then it is getting faster and more improved. Honestly, I don't think this tablet can get much faster, it's a little speedy Gonzalese...Lol!

..

34687513 I got the Slate 8 Pro for Christmas because of the 4:3 aspect ratio, 1600 x 1200 pixels, Tegra 4 chipset, separate micro HDMI port, and portability. The specs were great, the screen looked bright and colorful and the system seemed snappy. The rear camera took good pictures from the few I took. I didn't try the front camera.
I didn't like some aspects of the device, so I returned it. It felt a little dense and heavy in my medium sized hands, probably due to the relatively large bezels at the top and bottom making it longer and causing the weight to be unbalanced.
The speakers sounded good, but I felt they should get louder. Sometimes I like to lie down with the tablet on my stomach. That blocks the bottom firing speakers for the occasional YouTube video I watch in the same position (same applies to iPad Mini#. What I especially didn't like was the volume control. The control is on the right side of the tablet towards the back and flush with the sides. It was therefore not so easy to find without looking if holding the tablet with one hand. HP should have put a bump on the control #including the power button# to make it easier to find. I could do it using some glue, but I shouldn't have to risk damaging the tablet if HP did better user testing.
I use tablets mainly for reading, so I compared it to my 10.1" Asus Transformer TF101 #1280 x 800 pixels, 16:10 aspect ratio). Even though the HP 4:3 aspect ratio seems good for reading, I noticed little difference in the amount of text I could see with both in landscape mode with the same relative font size using the Safari Books app. Also, the Google News web site appeared similar on both in landscape mode, despite the supposedly better HP 4:3 aspect ratio. I suppose if I had a 16:10 aspect 8" tablet for comparison, then the 4:3 aspect ratio would be better to see more information.
I use an app called Droid 48, which emulates an HP 48 calculator. It looks fine on the Asus TF101, but not so good on the Slate 8. The labels were off and mismatched on the keys. I didn't see the problem on other apps I used, however. I suspect this particular app did not scale properly because it occupied the entire screen and was probably built more for the 16:10 aspect ratio.
Another aspect was the memory. Running apps I normally use, I frequently saw around 300 MB of memory free out of 1 GB. That wouldn't be a problem because I don't play games, but may be a problem for others who play intensive games on the tablet, given its specs. It's easy enough to close apps and clear memory, but then you'd expect to have more memory in a premium device.
I think this is a good attempt by HP to make a premium device. Their next iteration should make this the one to get.

..

34687513 After spending an evening with the tablet I'm really impressed. The screen is beautiful and the 4:3 aspect ratio is great for surfing. I read some concerns about limited apps because of the aspect ratio being odd for an android tablet but so far I haven't found any apps that won't install. Gaming has been great. The tegra4 has handled everything I've thrown at it. Can't really comment about the battery life yet. The only negative I've found is it gets a little hot when gaming. HP seems to have done a nice job with the 8 Pro.

34687513 I bought it from BestBuy.com during Thanksgiving last year(2013) and deliverd it to my address on December 9, 2013 by UPS. It is NOt so good. I am astonized about ASUS laptop gone so early. I will contact with ASUS whether they replaced battery or NOT?
Thanks!

34687513 I needed a small netbook to do: Word, Excel and PowerPoint as well as the normal internet navigation. Most laptops are bulky, heavy and have more processing power than I was going to use anyhow. I have used it for over 3 months and works great and fulfilled my expectations.

..

34687513 I use this little laptop everyday for hours on end. Microsoft Onenote, Word, and Excel work great on it for school, I use it to research and I can keep 10 windows on my browser open at once without sacrificing a lot of performance. I stream Netflix in HD without any problems. After this I decided to really push this Laptop and see what it would do, I downloaded Star Wars The Old Republic which is a pretty hefty MMO for any average laptop. It did take about nine hours for the entire game to download and install as opposed to about the five hours it takes for my gaming PC however once the game was installed this little Asus budget laptop has ran the game without any problems. This is a good PC for the price. My only criticism is that the touch screen is a little clumsy and unresponsive when compared to my ipad.

..

34687513 This notebook started off great, but the more use I gave it the slower it crawled. Eventually it just died, going to the BIOS screen and not being able to see evidence of a harddrive. BestBuy has a 15 day return, this conveniently happened on day 18. Still need to contact manufacturer and see what they will do for me. Had to buy a new laptop in a hurry as the quarter is ending soon, even if they fix it, it's still a cheap piece of junk.

..

34687513 It's cute, but still sports Windows 8 (not RT) with touch screen.
What turns me off is slow processor and Asus touch pad, which enables multi-touch in a very inconsistent manner.
Otherwise, the size, 4- hour battery, and touch screen make it a good writer's laptop.

..

34687513 Def recommend for anyone wanting great sound, but on small enough speakers to bring along in a bag or pocket.

..

34687513 Jawbone has done an update regarding Macs and pairing it with my MacBook Pro was simple as was my iPhone 4S. Live Audio is a fantastic feature available when the Jambox is updated. Literally (but you have to have the Jambox right in front if you), the sound is 3 dimensional. Voices are, for example, center and music left, right , in the middle of the room and behind! There is also the option not to use Live Audio but use Sound Clarity which is not 3 Dimensional but if, in the case of one song, producing static with Live Audio, using Sound Clarity did not. Sound Clarity can go louder than Live Audio but i can't express how impressive Live Audio is on this tiny speaker system. It should be noted that on that one song that produced static, lowering the volume during Live Audio resolved that issue. The Jambox is not really loud but it definitely is immersive and "feels" loud. Well done but I wish it were half the price. Love it!

..

34687513 I was stoked to get the Jambox home and fired up. After a week of use, I think not so much.
First thing I noticed was the system sounds: loud on startup, loud on volume control and really annoying voice reminder to recharge the battery - in the middle of the night. And it was loud.
It's a great little unit with awesome sound when it's music and not the loud and annoying voice or tones. Jambox is aware and still no fix. The software is updatable and customizable via website but not for the tones.
I enjoy the device but the terrbible tones are a deal breaker for me.
Easy set up. Good sound. Battery level and connection icon in iPad menu bar. Dings for the terrible tone interaction and not good for quiet environs such as work or home when voice and volume adjustments kick in.

..

34687513 My wife and I took this product to Mexico on vacation with us. Easy to bring along your music, and sounds fills the room with this little device. Also, bluetooth connectivity makes it very easy.

..

34687513 Wow where to start. I just bought my Jambox this evening, and I'm completely enamored with it. First, it just has a *quality* vibe about it.....several high-quality cords included and even a sleek little case.
It's so much smaller in person than I expected! Even from the pictures, I couldn't tell how tiny it would be.
Pairing and using this with my iPhone was simple and seamless. I had some issues getting it paired with my Macbook Air, but the Jawbone support site had some FAQs that helped me fix it right up (I found the official FAQ more useful than the forums)
Sound is really wonderful. Bass is amazing. I mean, remember we're talking about something smaller than many blocks of cheese. But this really puts out the sound - way better than I would have expected for something this size. I would use it for a party, though I don't throw really raucous parties.
I've read reviews that say it can "walk" off of surfaces, but I haven't seen it move around at all even at top volume.
I will say it's not super awesome as a speaker phone. But, perhaps that is a limitation of speakerphone on an iPhone. I've used it (once to call jawbone support already :-) ) and once to call my mom. It wasn't great. Mom wanted me to turn it off. But it does work.
I haven't tried voice dialing through it yet, but I did try activating it and that was easy. I don't really use voice dialing.
In case you're wondering, like I was (and why I called the support line), yes, the LED is supposed to blink white continuously when the jambox is in use.
Not cheap, but for what you get - portability! sound! no cords or batteries! - it's worth it.

It is not for things you write or draw that you want to save.

Stream tunes wirelessly to this Klipsch GALLERY G-17 speaker system that features AirPlay technology, so you can listen to music from your iPod, iPhone or iPad via your home Wi-Fi network. Tractrix Horn technology ensures powerful audio.


..

34687513 I've had this product for almost a year now and it continues to surprise me time and time again. First let's touch on those dedicated aluminum tweeters. Not many other docks have highs like this Klipsch, and Klipsch is known for their highs. I've compared this dock to the original Bose Sounddock Portable and the Bose sounds dull in the high end, mainly because it doesn't have dedicated tweeters. Not to mention the fact that they are aluminum, which is my favorite kind of tweeter because the response it always sharp and accurate. The woofers on the dock really do this thing a justice as well. Compared to that portable Bose, this dock responds differently in the lows. The Bose has that fancy amplifier technology that turns up the bass at low volumes and then levels off the bass when you turn up the volume, the Klipsch doesn't have this feature. The Bose is tuned for a punchier, higher mid bass sound, which can be pleasing on many recordings and in many different locations but it isn't exactly reference quality. The Klipsch delivers almost reference quality, which is what they are known for. Because the enclosure is so large (not to mention heavy), the woofers are tuned to a low frequency. This means the bass is REALLY low, reference low. Not many woofers can man handle those kinds of frequencies, but these can. The Klipsch will dip down low on a continuous bass line and make it sound great! It might not be a preference to all listeners but it's my favorite. It'll sound good in almost any room from anything like Jack Johnson to dubstep. The design of this thing is great! I would never be embarrassed to show up to a party with this elegant looking piece of work. I'll take her outside, and to other people's houses all the time. Grille on or off, she's a dime. It's a glossy finish so it can get smudged up easily but no worries, Klipsch provides a pair of Micheal Jackson gloves to handle your elegant sound system! Haha no joke. But like I said, she's been around the block once or twice and I've had her for almost a year, so it's been obvious that she's durable and she still looks great.
Cons: Every time you start up the dock, just hitting the power on, it takes 30 seconds before you can do anything. This means anything from connecting to the network or simply plugging in, you're completely handicapped. That and the whole connecting to a network is a bear. I'll switch from network to network periodically and it doesn't save any previous networks it's been on. And this doesn't help when it takes 3-4 mins just to get it configured on the network. The USB port works like a charm tho. I'll plug my iPhone into it and I can control the music with the provided remote.
Summary:
In the end this dock was a primitive WIRELESS dock for it's time. The whole Airplay technology was young so you need a solid wireless connection to stream seamlessly (at least a consistent 1 mb/s). Then if you look at it's original retail price or apple's website, it went for 550 dollars! So if you can look past some connection issues the sound quality is stellar. I love this little tanker and I can't get enough of it. I paid about $170 for it on a deal of the day but I would have paid $250 knowing how satisfied I am. Truly stunning sound from a dock even in large rooms.

34687513 It's great item once we learned how to connect to it
Sounds awesome better than expected!

..

34687513 researched this item for a while and when i found it on sale at best buy i nearly died. best airplay speaker ever. sounds great with my klipsch desktop speakers.

..

34687513 I am a Bose person. This small AirPlay unit is very nice & adapts to all my smart products. Great when we r hvn a get tgthr with friends outside we just carry it - plug in & it's on for continuous play with No Wires. Heavy base so if UR not a fan of heavy base this is not for you. Good for two bills though. We r happy with it.

..

34687513 This is a great Bluetooth or Airplay speaker. It is easy to set up, and the sound quality is better than most comparable systems.
Stereo separation is lacking - but that makes sense in an all in one speaker. The high end is not as pronounced as the low end.

..

34687513 It was easy to set up and easy to use. It has great sound.and very useable features.

..

34687513 I got my unit on sale, reduced to $100 from $500. Klipsch is a good brand so I had high expectations. They seemed to spend all their time on how the product looks and not how it sounds, or on features. My unit arrived with volume controls not working, but I would have returned it anyway. The lows were very boomy. The highs very tinny. I can't imagine anything worse.

..

34687513 I have an iPhone 5 and iPad2. When at home I wanted to be able to listen to podcasts from the iPhone or TV shows from the iPad without having to wear bluetooth headphones. I got 2 of these Klipsch on sale for $99.
The sound is really great for my needs. Seems full, and loud enough. Sounds real. However I am not an audiophile.
These work with the iDevices via Apple's Airplay, which is not available on all devices so check you model. It is available on both of mine. You double-click the home button and an audio panel displays at the bottom of the screen. Then you swipe your finger right until you scroll all the way to what is at the left end of the icons, which is audio settings that include an airplay icon. That gives you the choice of any airplay speaker to direct the sound to. You cannot send one device's sound to all airplay speakers, which is too bad.
Still it's better than wearing headphones everywhere. I am happy with the purchase. Setup was easy through a downloadable iPad app.

..

34687513 Sounds great, once you get it to work. You may have to reconnect.
Should only be used by someone with the patience to work with it.

..

34687513 I bought two of these items and after a month I have to return them because the Airplay over the Wifi network was cutting off the signal and was so annoying when the volume was at its high. I replace the two units with 2 Bose SoundLink Bluetooth Mobile Speaker II - Nylon and this is a best choice of Air Play. The bluetooth of Bose worked better than the Wifi capability of the Klipsch.

Get high-quality sound with these earbud headphones that feature 5.8mm drivers for smooth, powerful audio. The oval ear tip design fits the contours of your ear and blocks out ambient noise.


..

34687513 Very good sound quality. Shuts out airplane noise and distractions. Just doesn't seem very sturdy.

..

34687513 These are very comfortable headset while sitting. If you are running they are not so good

..

34687513 Great sound can't go wrong with great company klipsch clear sound good bass not as good as the s4 but can't beat them for the price

..

34687513 Klipsch was highly recommended by a friend. She has the S4s which are amazing, but I bought the S3s which are less expensive. I've had them for a few months. They are the best headphones I've ever owned! Crisp sound, great mix of treble & bass (plenty of bass without overkill), perfect fit (due to 3 different sized earbuds), very lightweight and very affordable compared to similar models. My only complaints are: (1) the wires don't stay straight if constantly wrapped in the travel case and (2) sometimes I can hear when the wires hit my clothes; it sounds like a "thump". Still, it's a great product overall!

..

34687513 
From a tin shed to inside your head, Paul W. Klipsch's award-winning sound lives on in our Image S4 headphones. Put the concert in your cranium with the S4's powerful coil drivers, whose wide frequency range allows you to experience everything from soul-thumping bass to spine tingling highs. The S4's superior noise-isolating design allows you to seal in the sound, while our patented oval ear tips (available in 4 sizes) keep you rocking in comfort.


..

34687513 I like the way the headphones fit and the sound they provide. My only gripe is that they tend to get twisted when I put them away. The slide that is supposed to prevent tangling can cause them to twist when the headphones accidentally loop through the slide and the base.

..

34687513 Haven't had the chance to use them much but so far like them very much because of sound quality & I like the flattened cord attached as it makes them more user-friendly.

..

34687513 I have had these now for a couple days. I like them way better than the older version. Flat cable rocks and they sound just as good as the old version of the S4. Worth the price.

..

34687513 This set of ear plugs is a average set and the price is a little steep for the quality. Klipsch has better set's but you are going to pay more. I haven't listen to the other set's. Come's with allot of earplug's for fittting the ear and has a case for storing the set.

..

34687513 They sound good and are holding up so far. Haven't gone out in either ear yet.

..

34687513 They are good ear buds with good overall sound quality. I use them while exercising and they stay in place and block out wind noise.

..

34687513 I ordered my first pair close to 3 years ago. Have never had a problem with them, and still don't. I caught a deal of the day for a pair for $40. I couldn't pass up the chance, so I bought my second pair. By far the best earbuds I've ever owned. I've gone through countless earbuds where one side would die and one side wouldn't. After 3 years of constant use my first pair is still as good as the day I bought it. I decided to buy my second pair for the updated flat wire so it doesn't tangle and maybe to hand down my old pair.. I listen to all types of music, country being the least. These have amazing punching bass for rap, and great mids and highs for metal. So anything between rap and heavy metal these things work great. In other words, it doesn't matter the type of music, you will not be let down with these earbuds. They come with 4 size pads, so whichever size ears you have these will stay secure while working out, running, or anything in between. I use them for lifting weights and cardio, and never had them fall out. I doubt I'll ever buy a different pair again.

..

34687513 They do tune out external noise. They fit very nicely in my ears and the sound is really good.

..

34687513 Not bad. This is my second pair. Not as pricey as some of the others. I got mine on sale so pretty happy.

..

34687513 You're kidding...right? This is the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen. I don't have anything to write about it so I am writing this instead. There minimum reached.

..

34687513 Excellent sound quality. Liked it so much I went back and bought another!

..

34687513 They have nice sound quality and the noise canceling is pretty good.

..

34687513 these don't stay in my ears, sound cuts out frequently so it's rather annoying to me

..

34687513 Very comfortable ear buds. Great sound. All day compatible.

..

34687513 I've used skull candy headphones until this pair and I love them. They come with this awesome little case that fits just about anywhere. The controls on them from a phone are outstanding, from a tablet they do not work for some reason. Other than that the sound quality is great, the headphones are amazing

..

34687513 love klipsch and would probably choose them over beats next i look for headphones

..

34687513 Great earbuds with great sound quality, and fantastic bass. Tangle free cord actually works and they buttons are very easy to use. Many different earbud shapes and sizes to fit anyone's ear comfortably.

..

34687513 Klipsch has great sound and comfort. The only draw back i have discovered is that u can accidentally turn off your iTunes while playing

..

34687513 This is my second pair of these and I have no plans to ever switch brands.

..

34687513 Very good audio range with strong middle and good highs. Enough bass to fill in music. Good separation and depth. Multiple ear piece fits. Used for airline listening that was good choice though not designed to be total isolation or noise cancellation. Also use for treadmill and rower machines. Performed well overcoming machine noise. Only couple of occasions did ear pieces work loose. Flat cord helps keep in place. Do hear nuances in music that not heard with iPhone supplied earphones. Good audio quality to price ratio.

..

34687513 
Enjoy your music on the go with these Audio-Technica QuietPoint headphones that feature a control box with a clothing clip for easy attachment and a noise-canceling design, so you can listen without distraction. The Comply foam tips ensure comfort.


..

34687513 At less than 1/4 the price of Bose noise canceling headphones, these are well worth the price and very effective. I work in a computer room - lots of fan and air conditioner noise. The first time I turned on these noise canceling earbuds I was stunned by how much noise they cut out. They work very well, but may allow some very high frequencies through; I don't know if it's external sound getting through or my own tinnitus. The cord is a bit short at only two feet. I'm sure they will be excellent on an airplane. The product comes with both rubber and foam ear pads. I prefer the foam. They're comfortable and never fall out of my ears.

..

34687513 I use these for my daily commute and at work and listen to everything from audio books to music to voicemails.
The ear buds are comfortable and comes with replacements and a travel bag.
Noise canceling works great. You don't need the volume very loud to hear whatever you want to listen to. One downfall is that the selectable noise canceling emits a I recognizable noise that gives me a headache on occasion.
Overall I'm completely satisfied as this product meets all my needs.

..

34687513 These headphones offer great sound quality and the noise cancelling feature is perfect. I use them primarily when I shoot pool to tune out noise/distractions. I also recently used them on a long flight and the person sitting next to me actually offered for me to turn the volume up because she thought I had the volume turned down so that she wouldn't hear any music. I actually had them at a comfortable listening level. They come with a bag and some ear pieces to help with fitment. Don't assume your ear openings are the same size. You may have two different size ear pieces to make them sit comfortably.

..

34687513 Recently purchased a Skullcandy Titan after researching in various websites. The sound was very good, but ear started to hurt and when exercising had to continually move them back to the right position. I bought the AT after reading some of the reviews, paid a little more, but I tell you, they sound great! I didn't even have to change the ear pieces, they fit perfectly. The NC is excellent! I listen to a lot of contemporary jazz, smooth, fusion, etc. The whole spectrum (high, mids and lows# of music is very well defined, crisp sound throughout without distortion. Can't say anything about durability, since I just purchased them recently. I put "good" for comfort because I don't particularly like to wear in-ear headphones. For the $59 #what I paid# I think is a very good deal!

..

34687513 these have been great ear phones. i work in a lab so we have a constant hum from fans, pumps and instruments. i was amazed at how much sound these cancelled out. i don't have to crank up the volume just to hear the music.
do they block 90% as claimed...i don't know, but they work great.
they come with different sized pieces to customize the fit which was nice.
i've used them on flights and won't fly without them again.
they are ear buds and not over the ear so they aren't for audio quality super freaks but they're good enough for work/flight usage.

Keep your USB-rechargeable device powered up and ready to go with this AC adapter that plugs into most wall outlets for convenient use. The compact design is ideal for home or travel use.


..

34687513 Not much to say other than the adapter was very easy to use. Out of the packaging, just plugin your usb cord to provide AC to your device. I had lost my original adapter for my Kodak Playsport camera. This was an excellent replacement.

..

34687513 This adapter is great. It allows you to charge camera usb or in an outlet.

..

34687513 This is good and quiet fan. I recommend it to buy.

..

34687513 Really cheaply put together with ALL plastic pieces. Face guard wont go on either.

..

34687513 Fan gives off a lot of air, even when it isn't rotating. Very quiet and the color blends with our decor. Helps to reduce our energy bill.

..

34687513 It does the job, not exactly a powerful fan to cool a bedroom or living room, but keeps it from getting warm.

..

34687513 It works well and was in the expected price range.

..

34687513 Easy to use. Gets the job done. Great fan. Simple set-up.

..

34687513 JUST A WASTE OF MONEY. IT LOOKS AS IF NO AIR IS COMING OUT OF IT. NOBODY SHOULD BUY IT.

..

34687513 As I said before it is hot in Texas so any fan help us keep a little cooler. I use this fan in my room and it is very loud so it is difficult for me to sleep. But gotta keep it on to help keep cool. I even took the top off but that didn't help. What did help was turning it on the lowest setting but who wants to do that. Overall I guess it is a fan and its job is to keep us cool so if you go off just that then it does its job.

..

34687513 Extremely quiet. Real nice fan. Easy to put together. Good air volume.

..

34687513 Easy to put together, and works great. Good value.

This Lenovo ThinkPad W530 - 243852U laptop features NVIDIA Optimus technology, so you can easily switch between Intel HD Graphics 4000 and NVIDIA K1000M dedicated graphics to suit your needs. The 8GB memory offers enhanced computing power.


..

34687513 The Lenovo W530 is absolutely the most powerful field video production machine I have ever used. It power-renders through video so fast I am truly stunned. Coming from the Mac world, this handy, portable machine blows the doors off my 10K Mac Pro! I will never buy another mac for this reason. I maxed out the memory at 32 GB and do have a 3GB GPU and 8 core i7, so I did enhance this machine a bit. But for HALF the price of my Mac Pro, I am speeding through edits wherever I want. The screen is amazing too.
What I really love about Lenovo is how they design their entire ThinkPad line to be durable. I recently saw a video where someone intentionally spilled a glass of water on the keyboard and watched it draining out - then used the computer not 10 seconds later.
Apple has lost me as a die-hard customer since 2001 because of the quality of this machine.
Even the built in laptop speakers blow the doors off of any other laptop I have ever seen or heard.

This provides customers with a high level of confidence when using Lexar products to capture, manage, move, and store the memories that matter.


..

34687513 I've had my Lexar 64GB JumpDrive S70 for about a month now and I can't complain at all. The storage capacity is really nice and being able to slide the connector in and out is a great feature.
Please be aware, however, that I thought about returning it when it wouldn't work in peripheral devices that I use (Blu-ray and DVD players and computers running Windows XP). The 64GB JumpDrive comes natively formatted in the exFAT file system, which most current peripherals and Windows XP computers won't recognize. If you're running Windows 7, like I am, it won't allow you to format a flash drive greater than 32GB in the FAT32 file system, which most current peripherals will recognize. Windows 7 only allows exFAT formatting for these drives.
There's an easy fix for this, however. Just download and install the HP USB Disk Storage Format Tool,, v. 2.1.8. I won't tell you exactly where to get it, but it's as easy as a Google search. Make sure to get version 2.1.8. I don't know how other versions will work. Once you've done this, you'll be able to format any flash drive over 32GB in the FAT32 file system and it should work in your peripherals.
I know there are warnings saying not to format 32GB+ USB drives in FAT32 because of potential performance problems, but I've yet to encounter any. Once you do, you shouldn't have any problems using one in any device that recognizes FAT32. Since I don't use Macs, however, I cannot vouch for the effectiveness of this fix on that operating/file system.
Hopefully, in the future, peripherals will be built recognizing the exFAT file system, but until then, this will probably be a necessary fix for those of you who want to use a 64GB USB drive or greater on anything that doesn't run Windows 7.

..

34687513 It's a good quality jump drive and I like how I don't have to worry about if I'm going to lose the cap for it. I haven't found anything I dislike about it. I bought it when It was on sale and I used a reward certificate for it as well. It was a great buy.

..

34687513 This is a great LITTLE jump drive. I bought it specifically for the 32gig but the backup function is fantastic. You can select which folders and files to backup and it creates up to 3 backups of each file.
I even recommended it to a relative because I liked it so much!

..

34687513 This is a tiny flash drive and does exactly what I needed it to do, plug in to the laptop and forget about.

..

34687513 I bought one, took it home, DOA. Returned it for the same item, brought it home, DOA again. Refund, get something else. This product just don't work.

LG 2.0 Speaker System - 10 W RMS - Wireless Speaker(s) - iPod Supported


..

34687513 I love this player. Nice rich sound in a great minimalist clean package. I bought the middle size for my bedroom, but probably would have bought the bigger one if getting it for the living room. The double dock is great since I have an Android phone but an iPod nano player. It charges and plays while on the dock, or you can use Bluetooth. I think it sounds better than the Bose Sound Dock that I initially considered, but not quite as good as the new Bose Sound Touch (that doesn't have a dock). This LG was $200 cheaper than the Sound Touch, so it was a no brainer since the quality difference wasn't that big...in my opinion. An equalizer function would be nice but it still sounds great. I'm not sure why Best Buy doesn't shelve these with the Sound Docks...I stumbled across it by accident when I walked to look at sound bars near the TVs. I would buy this LG unit again without question.

..

34687513 I love the speaker, it sounds great and looks better!

..

34687513 Would buy this again! I knew nothing about docking stations and the staff at Best Buy were great. Some of the sound systems were a little pricey and I wanted something that would play music from our Android phones and Apple products. The Bluetooth connection is seamless and this also charges Android phones and Apple products. Sound is crystal clear throughout our entire apartment.

..

34687513 Great little sound box for the money. The highs are bright and natural and the bass sounds good as well. Blue tooth sound is good but plugging in a device is even better.

..

34687513 We currently own two of these units and love them. Sounded much better than all the other speakers in the same price range. The unit is a little larger than those other units, but in the rooms we are using them in it didn't matter. Couldn't believe how easy it was to sync with our Galaxy S3 phones and love all the features (esp. the LG remote app for our phones). Only slight knock on the unit is that with our phone covers on we can't connect to the dock but it doesn't bother us since we connect via Bluetooth anyway.

..

34687513 I recommend this product to any one that enjoys good sound from a speaker that's sleek , nice and comfortable in any room.

..

34687513 Gift for my daughter and she loves it. Sound quality is excellent and it was a great value.

..

34687513 I was going to buy Bose.
I changed my mine bought this as an open product.
I paid only 100$.im loving it. I wanted a Bose system. but lg helped change that thought.

..

34687513 I purchased this dock for my wife. She is an avid listener and loves the bluetooth option for her iPhone 5.

..

34687513 ITS GREAT FOR WHAT AND WHERE I USE IT WHICH IS IN MY BEDROOM. I REALLY HAVENT USED ANY OF ITS FEATURES SO I CANT COMMENT ON THEM OTHER THAN THE BLUETOOTH. IT WORKED GREAT FOR A DAY THEN IT LOST CONNECTION AND REFUSED TO WORK FOR A COUPLE DAYS . I BELIEVE IT WAS MY PHONE THOUGH AND NOT THE SPEAKER. I GOT THE CONNECTION BACK AND ITS BEEN WORKING FLAWLESSLY SINCE. I THINK THIS UNIT HAS A BATTERY BUT I HAVENT USED IT YET.

Enjoy movies, music and more with this LG NB3730A soundbar, which features Bluetooth technology for simple audio streaming and built-in Wi-Fi for access to Web content. The wireless active bass-reflex subwoofer delivers booming lows.


..

34687513 Great sound. Fills the room and the wifi options make it even better

..

34687513 Caught this item on clearance sale pricing so couldnt pass it up. Very impressive sound from a small sound bar i love it!

..

34687513 I would recommend this to he person that need a little more sound in their room. It fills a 12 x 14 room fairly well

..

34687513 I am truly amazed with the sound quality for a speaker system in this price range. It sounded great on store display and even better at home with my 50" TV. Wireless setup is easy and there's enough features and presets for fine tuning. I especially like the rich bass reproduction. I highly recommend.

..

34687513 When I bought the TV this sound bar was the last available & on sale. Lucky me as the price was right & very nice sound quality.

..

34687513 Overall I'm very happy with this product. It was really easy to setup and connect the subwoofer. It's nice being able to get online with it, but I couldn't figure out how to get on the "WatchESPN" app.

..

34687513 The sound bar system works great and sounds better than my old surround system did.

..

34687513 LG all the way!! I love it .... Highly Recommend, it's an A+++

..

34687513 This soundbar is great for the price. If you are on a budget and need a soundbar I would highly recommend this one. It is rated the best sound for the price. The apps are great if you don't have a TV, DVD, or game console that is internet capable.

..

34687513 I bought this sound bar, an LG smart tv and an LG blu ray player, not one of the 3 remotes would run anything but it's own device. I had this for 5 days and was listening to music at a moderate level, only half the level of capable and the tweeters blew. I returned this and the DVD player and bought a Samsung all In on, save $160 total and te quality is 10 times better, not worth the price

34687513 This TV is great. It was easy to set up and put together. The picture looks great. It is so clear. The 240hz refresh rate is amazing. It was easy to set up and connect to the internet. The sound is good. I love the voice commands using the remote. I highly recommend this TV.

..

34687513 Great TV for getting around on the internet and watching 3d and Blu Ray films. Linked this TV with an Energy sound bar and couldn't be happier with the performance of both. Not too keen on the IR booster which links my Blu Ray and Tivo to the LG remote but will probably pick up a Logitech universal remote to remedy that small issue. It's mostly my entertainment center that gets in the way of the signal, again no big deal at all. All around the TV functions amazingly and the 3d is fantastic!

..

34687513 This is my third LG set and I really like it. Setup was easy and I was able to watch TV about 30 minutes after I got it delivered.
My kids love it as well, in fact they are using this TV more than any other at home.

..

34687513 Excellent TV. It has all the features one could ever want. The only thing is you have to buy a camera if you want to us Skype to its full capability.

View your favorite shows and Web content in stunning 1080p resolution on this LG 55LN5790 LED HDTV that features a Resolution Upscaler, Triple XD Engine and TruMotion 120Hz for optimal picture quality. A 2.0-channel soundbar delivers powerful audio.


..

34687513 Would have given 5 stars if the sound was better.
The TV speakers are ok.
The sound bar was very disappointing,
I wired directly to our router, for the internet, and it works great.
Would have to buy a dongle for Wifi.

..

34687513 My wife and I were blown away by the picture . We have a Sony 5:1 sound system so we didn't need the sound off the unit. Eventually we will take advantage of the smart features. We purchased the LG before Black Friday and got an even better deal. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to get a television of this size. I work at a casino and the LG is one of the most widely used televisions used there (Keep in mind these sets are on 24/7 ) so you will get a lot of hours out of this product .

..

34687513 Good color with lots of options to change the color for different settings. The room where our TV is located is all windows so it's nice to be able to make the picture darker to contrast with all the bright natural lighting. The picture is very sharp but that's one of LGs great features. It is light enough to move easily and the 55" takes up much less space that the 50" plasma we previously had in the room. The remote has large buttons which are easy to see.

..

34687513 I love this TV! it has a sensational picture and the sound quality is pretty good. The 3D is cool, once you get comfortable with the glasses. The Wii and Playstation games are amazing to play on this thing as well. I liked the set up menu also - very user friendly and quick to navigate through.

..

34687513 It is a good tv plus the advantage of getting Netflix with just a push of the button.

..

34687513 this was a major purchase for me and I'm thrilled with what I got. The picture and sound are even better than I expected.

LG 55LA7400 LED HDTV: Watch all of your favorite shows, movies and online content on this chic, ultraslim full 1080p 3D HD. Experience 2-player games without the split screen, each player can enjoy a full screen on the same TV.


..

34687513 It's right up there on top with the Samsung and Sony.

..

34687513 I think it's a great tv it works wonderful the remote is wonderful I think it should have one more hdmi cords

..

34687513 The voice lady doesn't work very well, only opens internet and searches things for me whenever i talk to her. I try to get her to open netflix for me and other apps on the tv, but she only does web searches. Sometimes tv seems a little slow loading the menu. But not really that bad, only if you are extremely picky will you notice anything. and it is probably my internet that is slowing it down, i don't have the best internet.

..

34687513 The LG 55LA7400 is an excellent example of a passive 3D Smart TV. Amazing picture in both 2D and 3D, and the 2D to 3D conversion is super-impressive. Amazing 3D depth and quality on 3D BluRay discs. Playback of online videos (YouTube) sometimes choppy and buffering takes longer than expected. A fantastic TV and great value for the money.

..

34687513 We wanted a Smart TV for Netflix, Hulu, internet, etc. This TV is so easy to use. The picture is amazing -- makes us feel like we're right there, no matter what we're watching. Remote is easy to use and you can learn to navigate without even looking at the manual. Best purchase ever!

..

34687513 Resisted getting a flat screen for so long. What a wonderful picture, sound and service from the Geek Squad

..

34687513 This tv has a great quality to it. The picture is excellent.

..

34687513 LG is really making a name. Very affordable yet high quality.

..

34687513 Love this TV. Super easy to set up, fantastic sound and great picture. Well worth the price!

..

34687513 I spent over 6 months making my decision between the LG LA7400 and the Samsung F8000. In the end it was the price and passive 3D which lead me to purchasing the LA7400. I found it hard to justify the additional $900 for the Samsung based on the picture quality alone. The reviews on the picture quality for both sets are about equal with a few more negative reviews regarding the F8000. I really liked the picture quality on the Samsung when it came to the contrast, sharpness and backlighting. However, I feel that the LG offers a more "true" picture when it comes to skin tone. The colors appear to be more natural looking and not oversaturated. I like the passive 3D on the LG over the active 3D that comes with the Samsung. My router is ~30 feet away and I have had no problem using the smart features. I calibrated this TV using the settings found on several web sites. Overall I am content with the picture quality but I have to admit that I am still trying to get use to lower contrast and backlighting when you compare them to the Samsung.
Overall, based on cost alone I am happy with the decision to purchase the LG over the Samsung. However, if I had had the additional money I would have likely purchased the Samsung F8000 or the F9000

With 3 cooling speeds, 3 fan-only speeds and 2-way air deflection, this LG LW6012ER 6,000 BTU window air conditioner distributes air throughout a room up to 260 sq. ft. for custom comfort. The remote lets you control the settings from across the room.


..

34687513 This is a/c is very loud and if you like to sleep you can not put it in the same room with you. Was fairly easy to install without any problems.
The low speed fair is not very low and like I said, very loud.

..

34687513 This ac was easy to set up. No problems with the ac since i have had it for a month.

..

34687513 Bought this for my 12x11 bedroom and it works well. Much quieter than the 8,000 btu Sharp unit I had before this, plus it keeps the room just as cold.
My only problem is that this does not have auto cool. It does have an Energy Saver button but it keeps turning the unit on and off every 30 seconds or so.
I paid about 160 for this and couldn't be happier for the money.

..

34687513 Worked great for 2 1/2 weeks. I turned it on, the fan made a horrible noise & froze up. It's attractive for a window unit but go with another brand. We had a portable LG before this that only made it through 1 1/2 summers.

LG 60LA6200 LED 3D HDTV: Immerse yourself in all of your favorite movies, shows and games with vibrant colors and sharp details. This expansive HDTV is sure to become the center of your home theater space.


..

34687513 I hesitated ib buying a new TV as I had one that worked. However, this was the best thing I could do for myselg.

..

34687513 This is a great TV. Unfortunately, I received my first one from the distributor with some dead pixels. So I have been working with best buy to exchange this product. Which has been a difficult process. I was unfortunate to receive a defective unit, but even more unfortunate to work with Best Buy on getting the problem resolved. It has been 1 month since i originally purchased the unit and I still have not received a working unit.

..

34687513 My husband loves this TV...Installed in his man cave and he loves sports and action movies. Very happy.

..

34687513 Looked for two months for the perfect tv and theirs is it we couldn't be happier.

LG 60LN6150 LED Smart TV:Boasting a screen large enough to see the smallest detail, blue rays come to life and your favorite shows are crystal clear. Brilliant colors and dynamic resolution create a premier viewing experience. Internet access allows you to stream movies, surf the web and more.


..

34687513 This is a nice TV with a great price. Love the picture, bright and beautiful, but the sound is not that great.

..

34687513 I got this TV after seeing it at the store. It set up easily, and everything you play on it looks fantastic. From streaming apps, blu-rays, and games on an xbox360/xbox one.

..

34687513 Added Magic Remote and Sound Bar. Easy setup for all. Have cable, security cameras, computer, DVD carousel connected. Great picture and sound for all. Wall mounted. Be aware LG TV's send user information to internet. Addresses can be blocked in router/gateway.

..

34687513 Purchased this TV for a mid size living room with several windows, the overall TV is great and I love all of the features, my only regret is that I did not get 240 refresh rate... My wife loves it and whether its Blue-ray, Apple TV or digital cable I have to say that I'm very happy also.

..

34687513 I have owned Sony and Samsung 60" LED previously and the LG is superior in every way. I would highly recommend this brand and this product.

..

Stay cool with this LG LW8012ER 8,000 BTU window air conditioner that features 3 cooling and 3 fan-only speeds for personalized comfort. The 4-way air direction helps ensure even cooling.


..

34687513 I have a bungalow. This unit cools my whole upstairs.

..

34687513 We needed a new Window Air Conditioner and read some reviews and noticed these LG seemed to be rated pretty well. It was a little on the expensive side but it seems worth it so far. It's very quiet for a window air conditioner and has a strong fan which cools the room quickly and keeps it cool. We'll see how it lasts but I am hopeful we will be able to use it for many years.

..

34687513 This is a nice looking, easy to use, powerful air conditioner. I wish the high setting was quieter but other than that i am happy.

..

34687513 I spend a lot time in my in Iinai and needed a reliable and quiet air conditioner, this is the one I chose due to size requirements and it is great.

..

34687513 This ac unit is so popular it was sold out elsewhere. Best Buy did me good, delivered free. Install was easy and the unit weighs less and runs quieter then another brand we had that had less BTU rating. Great deal.

..

34687513 this unit works great for what it's intended to do. the set up was easy. would go with recommendation for support as it is a little heavy and would put too much stress on the window without it.. the only reason I didn't rate it a 5 is that it is a 'little' loud when on high. no problems so far.

..

34687513 My 2 year old GE was so so, it spit water drops out the air vents and the fan was a bit loud and it did not cool that well on hot days.
This LG however is great. No water drops spitting out the air vents like the GE did and I own 4 of the GEs and they all do it and they are only 2-3 years old.
The fan on the LG is quieter, but there is a hum coming from the LG that bugs me, but after awhile you get used to it.
The LG cools great even on hot days, the GE did not keep up and they are both same BTUs.
Someone mentioned the LG has no cooling levels like high, med and low. Well that's what the 3 fan speeds are for, just wanted to mention that.

..

34687513 THE PRODUCT CAME WITH SCREW STICKING AT THE BOTTOM OF

..

34687513 The only problem was the need to add a 1x3 to the window sill so it would adequately clear the storm window frame

..

34687513 very disappointed thought LG was a great name in electronics.

Track your activity with this LifeTrak Move C300 LTK7C3001 watch that records calories burned, steps taken and distance traveled and features Bluetooth capability that connects to compatible mobile phones for access to your favorite fitness apps.


..

34687513 Loved the Life Trak...after looking at reviews for other competitors (Nike, Fitbit, etc), I found this watch the best bang for your buck. The heart monitor makes it a stand out in comparison to the fitbit model and the display sold me over the nike pulse. Overall, this watch is pretty accurate and still slim and sleek! Highly recommended!

Enjoy crisp highs, warm midrange tone and deep lows with these Logitech UE 4000 982-000071 on-ear headphones that feature 40mm drivers for robust, high-quality sound. The plush memory-foam ear cushions provide comfort for long listening sessions.


..

34687513 I'm very rough on my headphones but so far these ones have held up nicely while the base is average the overall sound quality is great.

..

34687513 As you can see my rating, Its less comfortable. but sound quality and quality of cable is great.

..

34687513 Decent headphones at the price there are better options out there but for what i needed them for they do the job.

..

34687513 These headphones seemed really nice out of the box but over a period of a week I noticed the chord got looser and looser every day. The sound quality as well wasn't nearly as good as I figured it would be. I ended up returning them for a pair of senheiser HD 428s which I love.

..

34687513 Bought for my husband and he uses it all the time. Really enjoys it

..

34687513 These headphones are lightweight and comfortable to wear. They have a good sound quality, I like how the padding feels around the ears.

..

34687513 These headphones are great! I bought them a little while ago, and the sound quality is great for the price. The bass is refined, the mids are decent, and the highs are crystal clear. The case looks cool, but it doesn't do much in the way of protection. Overall, they are great and easily usable for hours at a time

..

34687513 Fits comfortably, has a durable cord, and sounds great with all types of music

..

34687513 They are comfortable and don't hurt my ears. I don't here other noises when wearing them. Easy to use in the car

..

34687513 Glad I got these on sale for 49.99 - I'd have been upset paying 99.99 for these headphones. In addition to the cord issues, I did not realize these were "on ear" headphones, that sit on-top of your ears. For extended wear it is not very comfortable, although the earpads are fairly nice. My volume control does not work when using with PC, and the L-shaped plug-in is terrible for PC as well. These headphones are worth thirty bucks at best. They look and fit so well but not enough to make up for other defects.

..

34687513 Other than being a bit bulky, this bag is great. There is lots of room for my camera, 3 lens, and all my accessories (i.e., batteries, wireless adapter, remote, sd cards). This bag can also hold a tripod or monopod on the side. Plus it has a hidden rain flap. It's the only bag I'll need and was even on sale when I bought it.

Brew up to 12 cups of delicious coffee quickly with this coffeemaker that features 3 taste settings to suit your preference and an automatic pause-and-serve function for pouring a cup during brewing.


..

34687513 LOVE this coffeepot. Great quality product for a great price. Was looking for a product that was not expensive but would still brew a good cup off coffee. This product out performs all the other brands I have purchased for other family members. Favorite features are the brew strength and how hot you want the coffee kept after its brewed! I like it STRONG, family likes it weak. I like keeping my coffee at a low temperature so it is drinkable and doesn't burn. I have actually recommended this product to all my family members for their households. I bought a thermos to bring coffee to work too. Saves a ton of money and i have great tasting coffee all day!

..

34687513 Great overall coffee maker. Two things: remove bar inside pot for easier filling of water from refrigerator and adjustable auto shut off.

..

34687513 I love a coffeemaker with a cone filter - so much more coffee for every pot! This one was great for the $$ invested!

..

34687513 We have always liked Melitta Coffee Makers. This one is simple with a stainless carafe. We love the lid. It works well. That is one thing that most reviewers rated low on other coffee makers. Also, the coffee stays warm for about two hours. It isn't super hot, which is fine with us. Enjoy it!

..

34687513 I reviewed ALL the coffee makers I could when I was looking for this item. We go thru alot of coffee makers. My husband was looking for some things and I was looking for others. So I had to find one we both would be happy with. This coffee maker hit most of the points.

..

34687513 Love this coffeemaker so far! It's attractive, perfect size for countertop (i thought it was going to be bigger after seeing pictures, but am elated that it is fairly compact and elegant), strong pleasing blue light display, programmable, three different brewing strengths (regular is a little weak, bold is perfect - although i use less than recommended amount of grinds), stop-to-pour feature is nice, design overall very pleasing and functional - doesn't drip, brews and pours cleanly (although a little slowly, but not a big deal for me). Great simple coffeemaker for a good price!

..

34687513 So far I really like this machine (1 month now). It works great, and is compact -doesn't take up your whole countertop. The only thing I don't like is the caraff lid. The lid is difficult to put back on and I hope I don't break it sometime. We'll see.

..

34687513 Works have not had any problems so far. Coffee tastes good, easy clean up. Love the timer so coffee is ready when I get up

..

34687513 What a surprise to find an affordable nice looking coffee maker. It is not loud when on the brew cycle like the Mr. Coffee we had. I haven't seen this in any stores, only on Best Buy online. Would recommend to anyone.

..

34687513 This coffee maker replaced my 2nd Cuisinart coffee maker - both of the Cusinarts (same model) died on me :( My Melitta is the thermal carafe model. It's been about a month and so far this coffee maker is really great!...
*** Pros ***
- Looks good - love the stainless steel finish and red band around the the top of the carafe.
- Plastic and stainless steel finish are of good quality.
- Takes up minimal counter space.
- Coffee stays hot - even though the thermal carafe feels hot after the brew cycle is over, the coffee surprisingly remains hot for about an hour. Hot water remained hot for over three hours! I rarely have coffee sitting in a carafe for more than an hour, so not sure how long the coffee will actually remain hot.
- Controls/settings are straightforward.
- My favorite feature is the three brew/flavor settings - Robust is, by far, the best if you want a strong-flavored coffee. At first I thought it was too strong, but once I figured out the right amount of coffee, the flavor was perfect. I usually only brew a little over two cups and wonder if the Robust setting is stronger when using a smaller amount vs. a full pot.
*** Cons ***
- After removing the filter and closing the top lid, the condensation/water drips through the coffee maker and falls on the plastic plate (where the carafe sits) - I have a dish towel close by to wipe it up or I just leave the carafe in until after I dump the used filter. This con dropped the rating to four stars.
- Not a big deal, but an adjustable (on/off) brew cycle completion tone would have been a nice feature.
I am very happy with this coffee maker and hope it lasts longer than my two Cuisinarts!

This Melitta 80395 coffee grinder features a 16.5-oz. bean hopper, so you can keep plenty of your favorite variety on hand. Burr grinding action helps ensure rich, complex flavor, and 17 settings accommodate a wide range of coffee types.


..

34687513 This is my second Melita Burr grinder. The first one lasted for 25 years and I loved it's precise grinding ability. You just push the button and walk away. When you return exactly the right amount of coffee has been perfectly ground. It takes a little tinkering getting the settings just right, but once they're set it never changes. The burr feature is efficient and doesn't heat the beans the way a blade grinder does. Of course after my first one broke I didn't hesitate to buy a second.
Maybe it's just bad luck -- the switch on my new grinder broke after three weeks. Hamilton Beach is going to send me a new one . . . after I cut off the plug, take a photo of it, and email them the photo and a scan of my receipt. I imagine that's how warranties are handled now, but it's a hassle for me. I have no camera on my phone and will have to download the photo to my computer to email it, something I don't do very often and am not good at.

..

34687513 Grinds very good, and quickly. The expected volumes vary somewhat , giving variation in similar settings. Overall, it is well worth the money. Beats the heck out of a conventional pulse grinder.

..

34687513 after using a 20 dollar Crups grinder i had for about 8 years ,i decided to upgrade to a burr grinder.
After looking at whats out there for the price and brand names,this one seemed the best one for the money and features.
I like the one touch auto off feature ,so set it and forget it. The hopper holds a great deal of beans, so for me it lasts a while before i have to fill it again
I was all so looking for something that was different looking something i could leave on the counter and enjoy the style.it looks a little like a commercial grinder, so its a great conversation peace.
i hope to enjoy this grinder for years to come .
Actually I did not expect to find it at best Buy ,glad i did .

This handheld radio alerts you to changing weather conditions through 7 preset weather channels making you aware of daily weather patterns. The autoscan for weather channel on startup automatically takes you to your local channel for convenience.


..

34687513 I had overlooked the size of this item when I purchased it, it is "pocketsize" which is great for storing and traveling. Have only used it once thus far and it alarmed appropriately and was easy to operate.

..

34687513 This product is awesome. It does exactly what it says it does. When the January tornadoes came through in the early a.m. we did not hear the sirens outside, mainly because the alert weather radio sounded first. It woke us up and we were able to get to safety in a good amount of time. I would recommend this weather radio to anyone. I am soo glad we purchased it!!

..

34687513 We got caught by a severe storm overnight while camping because of a weather change. A gust front almost flipped our camper. This cheap radio is small and sits there on standby until a wheather alert comes. you can also turn it on and here the current local weather. It finds local weather stations automaticly ever time its turned on so its easy to use. The batterys last a long time. we have left it on standby for 3 camping trips and they are still good.

..

34687513 Bought as a gift and the recipient was thrilled. Small, palm sized and great reception.

Deep-clean and sanitize sealed hard floors--including wood, tile, linoleum, and vinyl--in one fell swoop with the Euro-Pro Shark Deluxe Steam Pocket Mop. Using just superheated tap water and patented two-sided microfiber pads, this lightweight, easy-to-use tool heats up in 30 seconds and automatically releases steam with every push-forward motion. A powerful weapon against ground-in dirt, dust, and dried spills, it also kills harmful germs including e-coli, then leaves the floor virtually dry behind it. This Shark model also offers an adjustable-height handle and 180-degree swivel steering for smooth maneuverability and comes with two cleaning pads. Additional features include an extra-large 15-ounce water tank, a long 25-foot power cord, and a deodorizing carpet glider. The mop measures 7 inches by 13 inches by 51-1/2 inches and carries a one-year limited warranty.


..

34687513 I love being able to clean my floors it hour using chemicals. Works great on real wood floors and ceramic tile.

..

34687513 This is so great, especially for elderly people or folks with back problems...no more wringing out a mop. I have one and love it so much, I bought one for my mother who has trouble with her knees.

..

34687513 I purchased this item as a gift for someone and it literally worked the very first use and then the second time the person plugged it in, it never warmed up the water to steam. It also has no on/off switch for me to attempt to play with. I'm so beyond dissatisfied. I am hoping to return it because I am still within the 45 day ELITE PLUS return/exchange policy.

..

34687513 This is actually my second shark, had my first one for 9 years. I used it on a weekly basis. It sanitizes floors wonderfully without using chemicals, which is important if you have small children. I do wish the tank was larger, but overall I highly recommend this product.

..

34687513 We bought this because steam to sanitize the bathroom floors sounded like a good idea. I didn't think I would use it for the kitchen and large tiled floor areas but tried it out and it cleaned the kitchen floor better than anything else I have used. I like that it is light weight, especially when doing large areas. The swivel head works great in small areas like the bathroom. I'm not sure if I will get tired of having to wash the cloth head cover but I like not having to buy disposable pads. I also like that it cleans without having to use floor cleaning products which will also save money.

..

34687513 This is a super simple steam mop. Perfect for anyone!

..

34687513 Shark is a great brand of appliances and I am very happy with my purchase although it is not a perfect product. The steam mop works well once you get used to it but it takes a while for the steam to get going and once it is going you have to keep pumping it to come out. Overall it does a great job!

..

34687513 Great value for the money. Left floors looking clean and shiny. Light weight and the cleaning pafs wash up nice.

..

34687513 I am very happy with the results when using this steam machine.

..

34687513 So Far the Shark Steam Pocket - Lavender
does a great job.
I don't like the color, so I hide it when I am not using it.
But the machine heats up the water fast and so far the floors are looking great.

Carpet Pro CPU1T Upright Vacuum Cleaner - 10 A - Bagged


..

35428116 While this vacuum seems like a name you may never heard about, the vacuum is manufactured by the Taconey Corporation. Taconey is the manufacturer of Riccar, Fuller Brush, and Simplicity vacuums - all premium models higher priced. The carpet pro is similar to several of the higher priced items since they are manufactured by Taconey. The vacuum has extremely great suction and the beater brush grooms the carpet exceptionally well - it is a metal brush-roller with special grade Teflon bristle strips that can be replaced. I have two cats and plenty of litter throughout my house to test the units performance ability and I found the vacuum easy to maneuver while in operation and maintained a reasonable sound decibelle as to not be bothersome. The one design flaw is the removal of the hose from unit to attach accessory tools to the unit. It is placed at the bottom right of the fron of the vacuum. Not to mention the locking mechanism for the hose on the unit is a cheap little plastic barb. This tiny little barb is very easy to break off when reatttching the hoose to the unit. I reccomened this unit many times over the mass produced common names you will find in stores such as Best Buy and its competitors. This vacuum will outlast those 10 fold even with using the unit more often if you have pets for example. Only other challenge could be those in rural areas whose access to larger retailers or specialty vacuum/sew shops might not carry the belts, bags or filters necessary and would need to be ordered online. Additionally there is no website for "Carpet Pro" to view the specs, general info etc. However, there are a number of folks such as myself who have done extensive research and are willing to share the info on blogs such as this.

Janome Jem Gold 660 Lightweight Sewing Machine - 8 Built-In Stitches - Automatic Threading


..

35428116 I had a bad experience with a previous sewing machine purchased at a fabric store that I brought it back. I'm a beginner and I couldn't figure out the tension for the life of me. My husband got me the Janome for Christmas and I was so nervous to use it! But I gotta say that set up and the actual sewing is such a breeze on this one that it makes me feel like I actually know what I'm doing! Lol. I already finished my first project and I can't wait to make more! Definitely a very great little beginners (or travel) sewing machine! I love it!

Enjoy your favorite tunes with these Monster Inspiration 128725-00 over-the-ear headphones that deliver accurate music reproduction with soaring highs and booming bass. Active noise cancellation envelopes you in the music by minimizing outside sounds.


..

41733712 A good headphones with very good sound qualities. I like the carrying case to keep it safe while traveling. However, it is expense and would like to see it priced at least $100 or more cheaper. They are a little heavy as well.

..

41733712 I bought these headphones for use on a daily basis while at work. I work a typical 8-5 desk job, and I listen to music throughout most of the day while sitting at my desk.
Pros: First off, these headphones sound fantastic. I have owned a set of the original Beats Studios since 2008 and these headphones have a much cleaner sound. The music is very crisp and really makes you feel like you are getting your moneys worth ($300). The headphones are also very sturdy and feel well made. They have a cool metal look and are aesthetically pleasing. I received many comments about how "cool" my new headphones were. Unlike the older Beats, these headphones will play music whether they have a battery or not. They do sound significantly better with a battery in them and the noise cancellation turned on, but they do work without a battery.
Cons: These headphones are extremely uncomfortable. I have a big head (wear a size 7 3/4 fitted hat) and the headphones really squeezed my head tight. They are MUCH heavier than my old Beat Studios, and I have always thought that my Beats were heavy to begin with. After wearing for 2-3 hours at a time, I have to take the headphones off to give my head a break. It felt like you have a 2 pound weight just sitting on top of your head, which may not sound heavy, but after having them on for a long period of time, your head will become very fatigued. The earphones are also a very tight fit. They do not fit comfortably around my ears. There is a very nice leather padding on the earphones, but the inside is a hard plastic.
Overall: I bought these headphones at the beginning of November and returned them in mid December. The sound is fantastic, and I really believe they have a much cleaner sound than Beats headphones will offer (I have owned a pair for 5+ years). However, these headphones were extremely uncomfortable, and I felt it was not worth keeping something that was so uncomfortable considering they were $300. If you have a smaller head, these headphones will probably be great for you, but, someone with a larger skull might run into the same problems that I did.

..

41733712 The headphones are great but wished the carrying case was harder to protect the headphones from light falls or other mishaps. But over all they are great. Love the metal look (actual metal) on the sides.

..

41733712 These headphones are the best! The sound is much better than the over priced bose qc15's!! The noise cancellation is every bit as good as bose. The inspirations have more style and are well built. If you love your music and great sound, these are for you!

..

41733712 Travel frequently & use these as I fly. Work great with iPhone. Nice compact storage case & wonderful sound. Love tuning out the crying babies on flights.

..

41733712 People complaining about sound quality should know that when you buy quality headphones you need to break them in for about 20 hours before listening. I'm about 10-15 hours in and they sound great.
They have a great sound at just an average volume, but can go very high with zero distortion. If you're spending the bucks give these a whirl... but honestly leave them on at low volume overnight or something to give the drivers time to be broken in before you judge.
I would be at 5 stars, but I am not at the proper time yet

..

41733712 My first impression of these headphones were quite negative. Monster have always been known to be all hype and little substance. I expected them to be like the Beats Studio (they use to be affiliated) but was quite surprised! These cans are good. A more balanced sound with great bass to boot. The noise canceling is good and when the batteries die, your music lives on. Unlike the Beats, these function with or without batteries. If you're in the market for a set of cans that have good sound, well built and fashion forward, look no further, these are the headphones for you.

..

41733712 I'm a drummer and with these headphones can hear cymbals and other equipment perfectly. They are not too bassy which helps a lot when playing along with music. Tried other brands but Monster was the best. They are very comfortable too!

..

41733712 Awesome sound!!! The sound is crystal clear and I can hear every beat!!

..

41733712 I travel a lot and was getting annoyed by my Beats. The sales associate guided me to his product. Excellent recommendation! These headphones come with a stylish carrying case, several color options, and additional headphone jacks. But it's the sound quality that amazed me. I've never been more comfortable on a 12-hour flight! The noise canceling is as good as it gets! I love these things.

Trim, shave or style your facial hair with this 3-in-1 tool that includes an adjustable comb to help you achieve your desired beard length. The Smart Foil offers a closer shave in fewer strokes.


..

38843311 I owned the previous version of this product for a good 6-8 yrs., before the foil cover was damaged........rather than buy the repair kit for ~$30, I purchased a new one. I have always liked this for touching up around
the noise, mouth etc. after shaving in the shower. The groomer attachment and trimmers work well for me.

..

38843311 I fell for the braun marketing campaign when I first saw the commercial.
The product looks amazing and very futuristic. However...during the 1st week the plastic cover broke, then after 3 weeks the trimmer started pulling my beard instead of cutting it. I do not recommend it.

..

38843311 This not a great shaver at all,if this will be your primary it would not be a recomended shaver.there are better shavers.

..

38843311 The product would leave you to believe this makes life easy. nothing could be further from the case. buy a $20 razor from CVS and it will beat this. It's an OK razor, but in order to get a clean shave I have to force the razor against my face, which is obviously not ideal.

..

38843311 Overall I think that this is a great razor, however, for someone like me who might not have as thick of facial hair as most I need to shave every two days in order to maximize the performance of the machine. If I take longer periods off in between shaving I notice that shaving with the machine becomes more of a hassle because of having to switch through the different attachments before being able to use the main razor.

..

38843311 This is my second CurZer. The first lasted about 8 years and the battery was still going strong. Many cutter head replacements + one trimmer replacement. The trimmer was the weak spot--it trimmed well for about 4 years and the drive joint began to fail but upon replacement of the trimmer assemble, it did not trim well. I assume that the drive pin within the razor itself was badly worn. So I decided to get a new CruZer 5. The new screen design is more effective, but the trimmer looks about the same, so I give it about 5 years before its drive system fails to allow the trimmer to cut. The long hair trimming (beard trimmer with a numbered snap cutting guard) is almost worthless. I resort to using my 15 year old Wahl hair cutting system--very effective. But the shaving function is good and the short hair trimming is good/fair with a maximum life of say 5 years before you will have to replace the trimmer assembly. By the way should you try to do this make sure that you get the instructions for replacement of the trimmer with the new trimmer. I did not get the instructions and had to request them. The replacement is very tricky and you will never figure it out without instruction.

..

38843311 Really disappointed. This device did not shave my beard. It sounded like it was, and I could feel it pull a little bit but no real shaving was going on.
Took it back last weekend.
:(

..

38843311 Easy to trim everything on yer face. Awesome battery life.

..

38843311 
Perfect for replacement as well as new installations, this powerful 4-way convertible range hood will fit into most all applications. The enclosed light and fan/filter assembly makes for easier cleaning.


..

38843311 we originally ordered another hood to match the Frigidaire range we bought, but it was on backorder with no real promise date. We went back to BestBuy and Chris helped us out and we selected this one. It was cheaper available and came with the kit we needed. It was delivered and installed with no problem. Good buy

..

38843311 it's a very sharp looking vent -- and I'm happy it has to fan types, so will dispose of fumes efficiently

..

38843311 
The Allure II provides the style and performance you demand and with DuPont Teflon, the easy clean-up you want. Meeting customer demands for a contemporary styled range hood that is 50% quieter than average hoods, is easy to clean, and brightly lights the cooktop.


..

38843311 The overall appearance is the first feature that grabbed my attention. It was the only range hood that looked well made and added a classy touch to compliment my kitchenAid stove.
I love the touch tone controls, no big ugly buttons. Classy lighting built right in with attractive glass covers which give off very bright light, and has three levels of lighting. Great product, great price!

..

38843311 Easy to install, really alot nicer than my 15 yo GE hood.

Garmin Carrying Case for GPS


..

38843311 This case is perfect for my 3.5" Garmin GPS. The elastic stretches enough to close the top, but tight enough to not allow to have it come open unexpectedly. Small size to store in car.

..

38843311 This looks very rich and the quality of material is great. It's something I'm proud to own.

..

38843311 My Garmin 4.3 can tightly fit in the case. If it is 3.5 inch, it would fit perfectly. But my GPS is bigger. Anyway, I can still use.

..

38843311 Great Genuine Case for Genuine Device. Very low prince than other competitor. Best Buy is the Best Place to Buy.

..

38843311 I should have seen it coming. I saw a Garmin Carrying Case for an extremely cheap price, and went for it. However, my Garmin is not even a year old, and it on the somewhat larger side, so unfortunately this does not fit. I gave it away. Although it does not fit my Garmin, I have to say that it is wonderfully made, except the button. The button is hard to "snap" into place. Let me explain a little more, there is this hair bow-like circle which you have to get over this button... needless to say, it was slightly tedious.

..

38843311 Great price and fits perfect on my Garmin case is a little small and snug but works out just fine.

..

38843311 I love garmin products. This serves the purpose for my garmin gps

..

38843311 when I bought my Garmin gps I was a bought to buy this case from Garmin I found the case at best buy a lot cheaper. this is the Garmin brand case to. not a off beat brand.

..

38843311 The cover was on sale for $2.00 and it claimed to fit the NUVI 50. It is a nice looking cover, well built and easy to use. IT is stiff enough to protect the touch screen yet thin enough not to be bulky. JUST one problem the NUVI 50 does not fit! Sure you can make the NUVI 50 fit into the cover but the elastic closure strap is stretched to the max. Ended up buying a kipper hard sided pouch online and am happier with it.

..

38843311 This case is a perfect fit and very durable.I don't have to worry about taking my gps out of my car and just placing it in the case and putting it in my purse.

..

Navigate your European vacation easily with Garmin's City Navigator Secure Digital card. Find points of interest for select countries or navigate your route with the preloaded basemap.


..

38843311 easy to use....saves money in rental navigation systems in european car rentals

..

38843311 This is an excellent tool for driving throughout the U.K. We simply put in the postal code of every destination and was able to navigate easily to every location. When we were using it for walking, the Garmin would ask if we wanted to switch to pedestrian mode, but sometimes it gave us confusing instructions - I think if we worked with it more, it would have been more helpful in this mode.

..

With one of the best and brightest screens on the water, echo 550c redefines color sonar scanning for freshwater fishing. Get the Clearest Possible Picture echo 550c turns fish into sitting ducks.

Installation takes only a few minutes using the quick-release tilt mount and versatile transom-mount transducer included in the box.


..

38843311 Very good fishfinder, saw this on several fishing shows and it works like a charm. Great to have when out on the water alone while fishing or to have on the 'numbers' screen so the depth and water temp are visible for the Mrs to see and not be as worried. Would recommend this model as its middle of the road in terms of other offerings of Garman fishfinders. Also it does show a usable screen in direct sunlight, and very accurate in showing what the bottom looks like, and the coverings beneath you. Have yet to take out to the ocean, but works very well in the rivers, lakes and ponds I've used this in. Even muddy shallow water.

Garmin Automobile Portable GPS Navigator - Refurbished - 5" - Touchscreen - Text-to-Speech, Voice Prompt, Turn-by-turn Navigation - Lifetime Map Updates - Lifetime Traffic Updates


..

38843311 Very easy to set up and updating the maps was very easy to do.
Although I don't know why the maps had to be updated so soon after I bought it. It also saves money having free automated updates.

..

38843311 Works very well for me.
The 'Advertisements' are just a small tiny box which doesn't interfere with the navigation and so far its been ads for Shell Gas station.
Although they should certainly inform people the 'free traffic' comes with those advertisements and should be a legal issue.
The fact remains is that this product is very good.

..

38843311 I have owned many Garmin GPS' and am yet to be disappointed by a single one. The nvi 1450LMT GPS is no exception. I really love the bread crumb trail that not every GPS has. Very easy to search for places. Great icon options. Super Fast rout calculations. Free lifetime software updates. Life is good!

..

38843311 This is my first GPS unit and I have been impressed! I recommend this to anyone in the market for one.
Sometimes it can take a few minutes (3-4) to get a signal (typically no longer than a minute). I have yet to use the business finder more than once, but the one time I did attempt to use it for an elementary school address, it just continued to "search" indefinitely until I gave up and just used my iPhone.
Also, the traffic feature (displaying any delay time) only works while it's plugged into the charger.
Other than that, this unit is awesome!

..

38843311 The experience with my second Garmin Nuvi is great. The 5 inch screen is a nice upgrade in size from the smaller model I had before. Lane Assist is a awesome feature whether using it on the highway or city streets. The unit performs consistently well. The only change I would make to it, would be to have one more voice setting level below 10%.

..

38843311 This is my third Garmin GPS device and they just keep getting better. I was completely enraptured with it...unfortunately, so were others. It was stolen three weeks after I bought it - boohoo! But I went right back online and bought another one because Garmin Nuvi is the best! I recently discovered that shopping with Best Buy online is a wonderful experience, so give it a try!

..

38843311 The unit works very well, the sound is very good at all levels, and is understandable. Excellent navigation, as it foretells the correct lane for exits, route changes, etc. The directions and display are very clear, and the unit is a good value for the money. It is also easy to use, and spoken street names are very useful for the turn by turn directions. I would definitely recommend a Garmin.

..

38843311 Overall, a disappointing product. Takes too long to acquire satellites and loading maps. Spoken directions, in some instances, are communicated after a point has been passed.
The Garmin website is also very poor. I tried ordering a case but it was suggessting a 5" case when the product is about 5.3".

..

38843311 The product is easy to use, very intuitive. I wish it could give route choices on the screen based on distance, tolls, time and then enable me to choose the route I want.

..

38843311 Haven't had the GPS long enough to measure durability, but it is very easy to use & has lots of nice features. The different views are great.

..

38843311 
The Forerunner 110 is the easiest way to complete your training. It is equipped with a GPS to measure distance and speed during your session: very easy to use, simply press "start" and start your business.


..

38843311 Ive had it for a month and have really enjoyed using it. Usually picks up satellites within a minute. Website for uploading runs is efficient and well done.

..

38843311 I purchased and kept it for about a month. I had an older molder and returned it because I believed I would have prob with the charger.

..

38843311 Bought this watch for my wife and it was difficult to teach her to use it. The menus are not super easy to navigate and it took multiple times going over it to get comfortable using it. With time, it is now becoming easier to use.
The best feature is that the display is fairly easy to read.

..

38843311 Well, I went to USA and got this GPS watch on a daily deal. The price was great ($100) and the reviews of this watch were better than the similar ones to him.
Everything was great for one month and a half of use. Now the GPS starts working but after 10 minutes of running it stops and just the clock continues running and the battery would die in 2 days now.
Im completely upset with the watch, Its sad that I had one chance to buy a watch for a cheaper price (in Brazil they are really expensive) and I chose the wrong one I guess.

..

38843311 This would be a great watch only if it charged accurately and not give wrong reading.

..

38843311 I use this watch for cross country. I love how easy it was to set up and use straight from the box. I looked at others before getting the garmiin and I am happy that we chose the garmin for my first GPS watch.

..

38843311 Bought one in March of 2012 and the wrist band began to crack. I purchased the protection plan so they sent me a new one. The new one was not accurate with the pace times. I returned this one at the store and they sent me a new one within two days. Unfortunately this one has condensation under the face even though I never went underwater or even had it in the shower. I called Garmin all three times and they said they would replace it no problem. I did it through Best Buy because it was quicker. It' s frustrating because when it works properly it is a great watch. Going to exchange it one more time. If I have another problem I will have to go with another brand. Make sure you purchase the protection plan for $19.99, it is well worth it. Garmin gives you a 1 year warranty as long as you can produce a receipt even if you have it registered through their website. By the way, Garmin connect online is a great feature.

..

38843311 The Garmin helps me set my pace whenever and where ever I run.

..

38843311 I especially like how small the watch is and how it has simple to use features. The price was good.

..

38843311 It does everything I need it to do and nothing more.

..

38843311 
Plan your next trip with this Garmin nvi 2460LMT GPS that features preloaded base map coverage of the U.S., Canada and Mexico, as well as lifetime map and traffic updates to help you stay informed. Built-in Bluetooth allows easy hands-free calling.This product has been refurbished.  Learn more.


..

38843311 This GPs is SO useful: allows you to type in favorites and also categorize them for quick access later; I've come to depend on voice command...it's especially appreciated when driving alone. It's been almost a year and we've had no problems, have updated the maps, and used it often. Our household has one unit and we plan to get two more for our adult children.

..

38843311 Love this GPS. Voice command makes it super easy to use. Love the intersection view and Bluetooth.

..

38843311 It finds my street but there seems to be only 1/2 of the houses on the street. My neighborhood was built in the early 1990's so new construction is not to be blamed.
New maps were downloaded and updated. And still my house does not exist. If I want to keep this, I will have to enter my neighbor's address as my home...

Garmin Runners Pro GPS-Enabled Sports Watch W/HRM - Sports - Digital - Quartz


..

38843311 Since I got this watch, I find it even more enjoyable to train for my first marathon. I run an average of 30-40 miles a week.
Really easy to install and use. It's an great gadget to track your runs and all the relevant indicators that are useful to plan your training. This is not my first GPS watch. I used to own the NIKE plus GPS watch, which costs the same and has nearly half he features and was not durable.
As an added value, Garmin lets you export runs so that you can upload to websites or tracking systems that you may be using.

..

38843311 This product is ok. I had it for about a year and it went on the fritz. I was scheduled to run a race, and right before the race, the watch completely froze and I couldn't do anything with it until the battery died. After that I had would periodically have issues where the watch would not go into power save mode, and the battery would just drain until it was dead which was very annoying. Never was able to get the stick to work either with my computer, in fact the software when I initially installed it crashed my computer, so I gave up.

..

38843311 I've been using this device for about a year now and haven't had any issues. The heart rate monitor syncs w/o a hitch and the ANT stick works perfectly. The touch bezel is nice and the controls are intuitive. The battery life is greatly extended if you turn off the GPS while the device is not in use. Garmin's website is an excellent tool to track performance, distance, etc over time. I would recommend this product based on my experience.

..

38843311 Great idea, but terrible execution. Never got the computer program to work and then the watch stopped working altogether after only one week. Battery life is extremely short and it needs to be recharged constantly.

..

38843311 In comparrison to the 305, the 405 is a huge disappointment. The touch bezel really really sucks! It is not easy to use the watch or to figure out how to get the software to work.
I can't emphazie enough how much the touch bezel ruins an otherwise great watch. It is way to sensitive. If you have the 305, stick with that, you'll be much happier.

..

38843311 I have had this Garmin 405 for a couple of months now. It does everything I want it to. I love the Garmin Connect website to track all your activities! I am a runner and so for have no complaints. Great Job Garmin!

Keep your Garmin Streetpilot or nvi GPS within easy reach with this cup holder mount that fits into most standard cup holder openings and features an adjustable flywheel base for customized use.


..

38843311 I have had problems with suction cup mounts and this is a good alternative

..

38843311 Great product! Looks good in my car by the Shifter with my Garmin GPS attached. Easy access to use because I don't have to reach to the dashboard.

..

38843311 Bought it for my 2012 Explorer - fits well, but due to the location of the
cup holders, it's easier for the rear seat passengers to see. Also - the unit pictured in catalogs looks to have almost a 90 degree bend in it -
I had a hard time getting it to bend, even a little. However, straight up
works ok. Read other reviews of set-up problems - don't see why.
Good for the price, nice to be able to remove the entire unit [with GPS
attached] to a secure location, when necessary.

..

38843311 This is a very practical way to mount your GPS instead of sticking it to the window or gluing a mount onto your dash and marring the surface. Works great and is stable in a standard cup holder. I gave it low ease of set up due to the fact that it doesn't work with expandable cup holders. It comes with pads that supposedly allow you to do so but they don't work.

..

38843311 
This GPS mount connects to your vehicle's DC adapter and features an adjustable design for custom placement in your vehicle. The mount is compatible with select Garmin nvi and StreetPilot models for a proper fit.


..

38843311 Great positioning for being able to easily use the GPS with my right hand. Like the fact that I can extend it so that the top of the GPS is even with the top of the dash, so my field of vision is not blocked. Can tighten joints so unit on vibrates when on rough roads, and even then just a little bit.
What I don't like is there is no electrical connection through the stand itself. I have to plug my old cable into that auxilliary connection and the one on the GPS. Can't figure out why the designers didn.t provide such a feed.

..

38843311 
Arkon's GN115 Mount is an ideal mounting solution for your Garmin Nuvi or Garmin StreetPilot portable GPS device.


..

38843311 Exemplary product, have had products like this before, but they are sub-par compared to this one.

..

38843311 Excellent mount for my Nuvi and way better than the garmin's own mount. This suction mount has stayed on my windshield since sticking it two mounts ago.

..

38843311 Bought this because the original broke. This one fits my Gramin Nuvi GPS and was less expensive. It is a little different but works much better.

..

38843311 We went over some very rough roads and the Garmin Dash mount didn't move a bit. It did what it said it would do and more!!

..

38843311 This Mount kit is amazing...I have Garmin 255W and work just perfect and never fall out from my windshield....I purchase one before from amazon for 5.99 and it broke second day. Just make sure you still have the old one so you can borrow the handle...this is just the mount.

..

38843311 It's much better than than one that came with the unit by far. The original one was for the windshield and it kept falling off. This mount hasn't given me any problems at all and it much easier to see and to operate where it is now.

..

38843311 Works as well as the Garmin model at half the cost.

..

38843311 Very good price and works great. Would recommend this product to a friend

..

38843311 
This vent mount allows you to keep your Garmin nvi or StreetPilot GPS close at hand while you're on the go. The removable design and 2 semiremovable vent clips allow for customized use.


..

38843311 I use this for my CobbAccessPort in my Speed3 and it works great. Fits on the vent very well and is surprisingly stable. I couldn't believe how inexpensive it was. Most other mount solutions are over 20 dollars. I like this because I didn't want a suction cup window mount for my AccessPort and this vent mount is perfect. I would highly recommend this for the AccessPort. I know it's technically for a GPS but the 17mm ball is the same as on the AccessPort and the cradle that comes with it fits perfectly into this ball.

..

38843311 Very satisfied and dursble. Ca remove and use in other car.

..

38843311 I was kind of apprehensive about buying this product. Garmin had their own but it was three times the price. But this little gadget is GREAT. It holds GPS in perfect position and it's very easy to install and adjust to your individual needs. Best buy from Best Buy!

..

38843311 It keeps the Garmin in a secure position without exception. No more Garmin rolling across the dash due to sudden driving motions or falling off the windshield into my lap or coffee at inappropriate times.

..

38843311 This is a great little clip. It is easy to install, it stays securely clipped to the vent, keeps my device off the windshield and dashboard, makes my GPS easier to see because the vent is closer than the dash and window, and it keeps my heavy GPS steady while driving.

..

38843311 Great alternative to the window mount. Was able to get the unit much closer to me. Now its easier to see and use making it much safer. Glad I bought it.

..

38843311 I have a trail blazer and the garmin nuvi vent mount was exactly what I wanted. It's easy to put together and install. I like the fact that the Garmin is now OFF the windsheild and yet very accessible to the driver. I would definitely recommend this product to others.

..

38843311 its a good mount to avoid getting the obstruction of view ticket from police when they see your gps mounted on windshield

..

38843311 This item was great right out of the box. Easy to install and stayed attached to the air vent pretty well. Now that I've had it for a month or so the clips that attach to the air vents seem to have lost their "grip." The spring-less clips are loosening and not holding to the air vent very well at all so that when I accelerate or turn quickly the device falls off and my GPS unit lands either on the floor or in my lap.

..

38843311 It depends the depth of the vent. If it is too deep for the clip, it will not stay for long. Check your vehicle before you buy it.

This corded speakerphone features call-waiting caller ID so you know who is calling before you answer the phone and stores the last 65 numbers for convenient call-back.


..

38843311 A great corded speakerphone that does not need to be plugged in.
Good to have a back-up phone that will still work in case of a power outage!

..

38843311 I needed a landline phone and this was perfect. Good price and it has all the features I need for a phone line that is rarely used. This is quite nice for the price and fits my needs.

..

38843311 Very satisfied with purchase. Will shop with Best Buy again.

..

38843311 This is a well-designed and easy to use corded telephone that has all of the typical modern features and works nicely in a professional office setting.

..

38843311 I purchased three of them as I needed smaller speakerphones. This phone uses batteries, so I will need to replace the batteries when necessary. I am very happy with this phone. The acoustics on the phone are very clear.

..

38843311 I bought this phone for my home use...it was easy to set up and it was great in the beginning...but after a few months, the window that shows who is calling becomes impossible to see...even after changing the batteries...returned it and received another one...same model and that phone was the same thing...what a waste of money

..

38843311 We were looking for a phone for the bedroom and didn't want a whole bunch of features, yet didn't want one that was so light it would fall off the nightstand. This one is just right. It is heavy enough to sit properly without being easily dislodged and is simple and easy to use. Very good value.

..

38843311 Other than sometimes the sound cuts out on speaker, the phone is great. It sets up at a good angle to read the screen and I like the large buttons.

..

38843311 Despite the fact that my last AT&T CL2909 stopped working properly after a year or so, I just bought another because the features it has (easy set up, speed dial, 65 call memory,speakerphone, good sound quality etc seem impossible to duplicate at this price point.
I am hoping that the digital display works properly for a longer time than my last one.
If you mind changing batteries every few months, or if you have sight problems (digital display is not that sharp), this might not be the right phone for you. I also have a very reliable cordless phone which I use and can use exclusively if and when this one fails again.

..

38843311 Just the phone I needed to replace an older wall phone for an excellent price

AT&T; CL84100 DECT Cordless Phone - Cordless - 1 x Phone Line - 4 x Handset - Speakerphone - Answering Machine - Caller ID - Backlight


..

38843311 The sound quality is MUCH better than the phone system I replaced.

..

38843311 
Add this handset to your AT&T; cordless phone system and enjoy the convenience of caller ID, call waiting and a built-in speakerphone. The handset is compatible with phone systems TL32100, TL32200 and TL32300.


..

38843311 I bought two of these "extension" phones to merge with the answering system that I had bought previously. The merged immediately, and picked up the directory from the master phone with no effort at all. Excellent!

..

38843311 I bought the base station by itself to replace an out of date model. I noticed at the time that I could add remote handsets. When our extension phone broke, I went to Best Buy to get the handset, and was told I would have to order it on line. I did, and was surprised to receive the handset within two days, for no additional shipping cost.

..

38843311 
Caller ID announceScreening calls has never been easier. The handset and base announce the name of the caller, so you don't have to scramble for the handset to see who's calling. HD audio with equalizer for customized audioChoose from four preset audio profiles, or use the equalizer to personalize bass, treble and natural tones for your individual hearing needs. Handset speakerphoneAllows you to speak and listen without holding the handset. This leaves your hands free to do other things and lets more people in on the conversation.


..

38843311 Use a few for business. not much to complain about considering price

..

38843311 I purchased this for my 86 year old grandmother. She really loves this phone. She can hear well from it and its easy for her to dial with it.

..

38843311 i have multiple phones and wanted a phone with an answering system that gave time and day. this meets my needs.

..

38843311 I went with this AT&T model because of its brand name. The machine is as basic as it gets, but it works really well. It's just what my father was looking for in a simple answering machine!

..

38843311 I should have looked at the reviews first. Its an ok phone would not buy this phone again cheap feel and sound quality is poor.

..

38843311 the phone is dependable and has good sound quality, price was

..

38843311 I bought this under duress, as my dual system went out for some
reason ( purchased at Best Buy 3 ryes ago)....I was given a nice discount to get a Best buy credit card, which I really don't plan to use much.
The phone meets my needs as it has automatic message answering with remote pick up of calls.

..

38843311 Great phone-sound is good-like the locator button on base.

..

38843311 The phone provides all of the things that we look for in telephone service. The phone was easy to get ready for use.

..

38843311 If you're looking for something affordable and easy to use, this is it!

AT&T; DECT 6.0 Digital Accessory Handset Only


..

38843311 Ordered as a replacement for old handsets and it was very easy to setup and exactly what I thought it would be.

..

38843311 Bought this phone as an expandable phone for my mother to keep in her wheelchair. It was very easy to add to the other four phones purchased.

..

38843311 I had a 4 handset system. With this I added a 5th hand set.

..

38843311 Great family phone. Good price. Love the capability to have many phones. Very user friendly. My 90 year old Mother is able to see the larger numbers and adjust the volume to her hearing ability. Would definitely recommend this phone.

..

38843311 Had all the features I need.
Lightweight
Easy to read display and keypad

..

38843311 We bought two of these to expand our home phone. They work great and were easy to set up. Unfortunately, they are a little overpriced. Knock $10 bucks off of it, then it would get a 5-star rating.

..

38843311 The size and shape is not good for holding on your shoulder, without using your hands.

..

38843311 Sleek design, lots of features, sound not clear, poor reception

..

38843311 I chose this phone system so we could add several handsets - and this had more capacity than any other phone system Best Buy carried. Its a decent phone, easy to use and understand. Call announcer's voice often hard to understand - only complaint.

..

38843311 When I placed my order, I didn't see the policy listing the brief amount of time allowed to return a product. Our landscaping company is very busy this time of year so I didn't have a chance to call for 1 month. Now I'm stuck with a product I can't use. Will NOT recommend Best Buy to anyone.

..

38843311 
This expandable phone system features a corded base station plus 1 cordless handset with a charger for easy call retrieval from any room. The digital answering system records up to 14 minutes of messages to help you stay in touch.


..

38843311 We needed a chord phone with answering machine that would work when the power went out. We have cell phones but in an emergency a land line is great. Also younger kids can u se it. We don't like giving out our mobile numbers to everyone. Took it out of the box and set it up in five minutes. Clarity is superb. Have had other phones that have strange feedback even plugged into the DSL filter. This one no problem. Most inexpensive phone for what we needed. Did not rate durability completely as we just got it a month ago. It seems excellent as well.

..

38843311 the phone was easy to set up,well designed and easy to use

..

38843311 The corded phone is excellent. However, the cordless is smaller than I would prefer.

..

38843311 I am an engineer, so I am picky about my electronics!
I bought this phone and installed it in my kitchen. Reception is great and features are good.
I'm very happy with it...although, since many people nowadays must dial an area code even for local calls, it's too bad the phone doesn't have a mode where it automatically inserts the area code if only 7 numbers are dialed.

..

38843311 Good for small business use with a single or multi-ring line. The display is large and eay to ready, base unit display tilts for easy viewing. Ring is nice and loud also. The base unit and cordless pair w/Answering Machine make this a perfect fit for my home office.

..

38843311 I was pleased with the service, and the gift recipient was also pleased and the phone is working well.

..

38843311 We wanted a wall mount corded phone with the ability to see the caller ID display from across a room. The wall mount allows us to do just that. The ease of use on this phone is very nice, from seeing who is calling to the notification of a message. We love the Memo feature!
The cordless phone operates just fine. To us it is to thin & light weight, just not our favorite. However, we bought it more for the features of the base unit.

..

38843311 I love this phone. It's really stylish and professional looking.

..

38843311 Great sound quality across the board, speaker, corded handset, and cordless receivers.., of which you can add like up to 12 or something ridiculous. Corded aspect for power outages is tight. Don't use the answering machine, but have used the two way in home option. You can page and talk with other people in your house on separate receivers, a sweet option that I didn't even know the phone had. Luckily I bought an extra receiver and can now talk to my wife from the office or bedroom while she's downstairs.

..

38843311 
Never miss an important call again with this phone system with a digital answering machine. The system expands up to 12 handsets, so you can place a phone in every room, and when you're out, the machine can take your calls.


..

38843311 A four handset unit with tons of features with the intercom feature being the greatest. So easy to use my 91 year old mother in law has no problem.

..

38843311 Wherever you are in the house or the yard, we have great reception. The phone has clarity and a good sound.

..

38843311 This phone system was purchased to replace an older one. The sound quality is outstanding with no static or interference from other neighborhood wireless phones.

..

38843311 Bought these to replace Nokia phones that we bought about 5 years ago. the sound quality is not very good on these phones lots of static. When you dial the phone is delayed by several seconds. The batteries seem to last when they are not hung up. The battery life is very good!

..

38843311 Love the large buttons and sound quality. Didn't want to spend a lot of money and this was the right price.

..

38843311 Good range, sleek look. good value for the money. I would recommend it

..

38843311 Great value for the money and comes in handy at the church because we all have our own offices so it makes it easy to talk and transfers calls

..

38843311 The range is pretty good, and I like how light they are. What's nice is that I don't need to buy 4 separate phones with this set. It has a fair price, too. The sound quality is ok. Some callers have trouble hearing me.

..

38843311 it was something I wanted, A bigger screen and a much better volume

..

38843311 I bought this to replace an old system. Was simple to set up. Definitely a good value for the price.

..

38843311 
Make and receive phone calls and manage your messages with this expandable phone system that features a digital answering system with 14 minutes of record time for ample message storage and a 50-name-and-number memory for convenient callback.


..

38843311 good phone for home use with extra phones to use around the house and easy useage

..

38843311 Purchased this for my parents as a Christmas gift. They asked for a new phone answering machine with a couple cordless phones that they can set up in the kitchen, bedroom, and basement. This system was ideal for what they were asking for. Appeared to be a good brand name phone system for a great price that I purchased on line. Glad I saw the email from Best Buy for Deal of the Day and was able to get a great deal.

..

38843311 We just got this home phone and it works very well. It sounds great, both on the phone and messaging! Plus it has 10 different rings to choose from! We bought the phone when it was on sale, and definitely think it was worth it.

..

38843311 Very nice phone for the money, excellent sound and easy to operate.

..

38843311 very good phone and it have very comfortable handset

..

38843311 Great phone for office use. I use phone for a 10 hour work day and have not had any problems. Love how far I can walk away from base and still have a great signal.

..

38843311 Enjoying clarity of sound, the intercom and remotes

..

38843311 as stated above! many functions i'll never use but they're there if you need them

..

38843311 This replaced an old answering machine we had for years. This one is lots better.

..

38843311 does what it's supposed to do. I like having the base with a cord - it works in a power outage (as handset) and doesn't get lost.

Keep track of missed calls with this AT&T; AT 1740 digital answering system that records up to 60 minutes of messages and features Message Guard memory to help save messages in the event of a power failure.


..

38843311 It has a small footprint. The tone has not been an issue for me. The only issue that I have is you can't stop the answer message once it starts. You just have to hope that they other person waits until the message is over.

..

38843311 I was disappointed with this answering machine. I had read a few dozen reviews which stated it was a great value but the sound quality from both my recorded outgoing message and the recorded incoming calls was awful, and it's no exaggeration to say I couldn't understand a word of either when I played-back. It was so bad that the outgoing message sounded like I recorded it with my head in an empty 5-gallon bucket. Not what I was looking for at all. The good news is that BB took it back and refunded my money on the spot, no questions asked. As it should be.

..

38843311 Needed a replacement for our answering machine and this fit the bill without being costly nor complicated. Setup and enabling features was a breeze.

..

38843311 The AT&T digital answering works great. Easy to set up. Great value for the price. I am we'll pleased.

..

38843311 This unit was purchased to replace an older unit that had quit working. The new unit is much more efficient and easier to use. To date we are very happy with our selection of the new answering machine.

..

38843311 There are not many stand alone answering machines left on the market today so I was happy to find this one that I could connect to our current office telephone system. Very easy to use, sound is clear, price is great.

..

38843311 Set up was mostly trouble free. The instructions indicated that the machine didn't have to have a phone connected to it in order to work. I found this to be untrue. A phone connection was necessary. Programming was easy.

..

38843311 Answering machines can be hard to find unless they are attached to a cordless phone. This is the second one of this style from AT&T that I've owned. First one lasted about 10 years. I love the idea of being able to choose from many choices in setting this up. My favorite is having it announce the incoming number. For a very basic answering machine, I have found this to be one of the best.

..

38843311 ITS HARD TO FIND JUST AN ANSWERING MACHINE THESE DAYS . PRICE IS GREAT ,GOOD FEATURES

..

38843311 I wanted an answer machine to avoid using the phone companies, and I didn't want to replace my 4 wireless phones. I've had this for nearly 2 months and it has worked fine.
It is cheap in quality though and a bit funny. You can set the "day of the week" and the year but you can not set a date. I.E. You can set it as Monday at 1PM but you can't give it a date. Very strange but as I won't be going weeks without picking up my messages it doesn't matter to me.
As for the feature that reads out the telephone number for incoming calls I found that annoying and turned the feature off. It is easier, quieter/more private, and nicer just to look at the caller ID.

AT&T; SynJ SB67108 Cordless Handset


..

38843311 The product it's great, but the supplier doesn't. They spend at leats 14 days for the shipping and when I get my phones (I paid for 2 sets), one of the six handset was previous used, so I can't register it with my base. They doesn't have any customer service number or email, so I spend my money in one used and useless phone.

AT&T; Trimline 210 Standard Phone - White - Corded - 1 x Phone Line - Backlight


..

38843311 I do not like talking on cell phones for long conversations. I prefer to have well-functioning landlines in the house. My quest has been increasingly unsuccessful; I can't buy what's not being made. The two Trimline Phones I bought, through Best Buy, are so-so and barely functional, respectively. Best Buy says it's my problem, as I "went outside" the 15-day return window. I can "complain to AT&T" if I don't "like" the tinny-sounding phone. I am sure THAT will go real far; AT&T will extract a large shipping fee for me to return its piece of junk in order that it can then send me an identical specimen. Probably in another decade, there will be few people left who remember or care what it was like to have good-quality, home-based landline conversations. All private interactions are now supposed to take place in public, on cells. Whether the voice quality of those calls is abysmal or not doesn't compute in the minds of the vendors or the users. The phone has become an instrument of status vs. communication: "I am so important; look, people are calling me! I have an endless audience for the minutiae of my life, which surely must be enthralling to all within captive-audience radius." The shoddy landline phones may as well stand as gravemarkers to a time when people actually cared about hearing each other and being heard, not just going through self-aggrandizing charades they call "conversation."

..

38843311 Purchased two plain no frills landline phones for use when power is out and cell towers are either not available or overloaded. Have learned through past experiences that a good old hardwired phone is the best, most reliable thing to have. These phones do the trick in a pinch, without a lot of extra features.

..

38843311 I purchased this phone because the digital phones need power in order to work. I have digital cordless phones for convenience but batteries never last long enough. I rarely use my landline except for Internet connection but I keep the landline for a back up. Easy for 911 calls from residence and if the power goes out... my landline is still operational!!! I have an older home which already had the wall mount so it was as simple as opening the box and putting up the phone. But this phone can be used as a desktop phone too. Affordable price makes this a no brainer to have as an option.

..

38843311 Great landline phone to have if one loses power. It is simple to use, looks great. Can be used on the wall or tabletop. For wallmount, just reverse the tab where the receiver hangs unto phone. It has great clarity and no static. My previous phone was also an AT&T 210 that we have had for over 20 years and just plain woreout. The price is right for this little gem. You won't be disappointed, give it a try.

..

38843311 Love the phone. Unable to fine a phone as good as this phone for its price and quality. Thank you.

..

38843311 Terrific traditional landline phone. Comfortable on the ear and against the shoulder. Great value.

..

38843311 The phone was at a great price and I am please with the purchase and the way Best handled the sale.

..

38843311 I wanted a small simple phone for my bedroom nightstand with a lighted dial. What I would like to have had in addition is Caller ID.

..

38843311 I needed a new home phone to replace a broken old one. It works well and was a good value for the price.

..

38843311 Can only use buttons for calling number. Can't use for extensions or features, etc. For this reason can only use as 2nd phone

..

..

38843311 The phones look and work great. We are using 6 phones with two incoming lines. All the employees like the style and the sound of the phones. The angle of the display screen makes it hard to read so we added phone stands. The programmable settings are easy to use and it was up to each employee to decided if they wanted to program phone numbers or extensions. There is an additional directory on the phone to program numbers and to save from the caller ID. The speaker phone is loud the sound comes out clear and easy to hear. Overall we are very pleased with our new phones.

..

38843311 Very good review and very happy with delivery and bestbuy.com

..

38843311 We have had a stand-alone pc-based answering system for the last 7 years, but when the hard-drive recently crashed we did not want to invest in a new cpu until we were ready to upgrade the whole phone system. We have 6 lines coming into our office, but we really only need 2 or 3 answered after hours since we rarely have more than a couple callers after hours and almost never more than one at a time. This phone will answer up to four lines simultaneously and works great for our needs at a fraction of the price of a new pc-based system.

..

38843311 We purchased 3 1080's as we were moving to auto attendant mode. We wanted to get voice mail boxes for 3 individuals. We're very happy to have our own voice mail and it's pretty easy to use. The number of rings when using the message/voice mail system is a little long. We've only been using them for a few weeks. Hopefully, they will continue to get an excellent rating from all of us.

..

38843311 I purchased this phone for my Home Office and needed a 2 line phone. The keyboard and layout of the phone is great. The sound quality on the speaker phone. The phone is easy to use out of the box but has many features which you need to discover in the manual.

User-friendly wireless DECT headset connects easily to both desk and softphone via USB port. You can move to Unified Communications telephony at your own pace and benefit from wireless working and enhanced productivity from day one. Simple touchpad display provides easy call handling even for first time headset users. They can handle calls four ways: via headset, touch pad, PC Call Manager or keyboard shortcut. Headset provides up to 450 feet wireless range, 11 hours talk time, 46 hours standby time, choice of three wearing styles.


..

38843311 The sound is great in both directions, and the headset is comfortable. The ear hook was my preference, but didn't work for me (not a snug enough fit). Tapping on the side to mute is problematic for me - maybe I haven't found the sweet spot? Would have preferred a button. For now, I have to use the mute button on the phone.

The easier way to talk hands-free while driving The Jabra CRUISER2 Bluetooth in-car speakerphone makes hands-free in-car calls even easier. To start with, its voice gives you simple pairing instructions the first time you turn it on. After that you just put it on your sun-visor and it will connect automatically with your mobile every time. It will also synchronise with your phonebook. The Jabra CRUISER2 will then say the names of the contacts in your phonebook when they call. And when you answer, Noise Blackout technology and a dual microphone system ensure the conversation always sounds just right. The Jabra CRUISER2 looks right in any car and its carefully positioned buttons make it exceptionally easy to operate. You won't run out of charge because its voice will tell you when it needs more power. It is also equipped with an FM Transmitter and A2DP, which allow you to stream your music from your phone to the car stereo. With the Jabra CRUISER2 you stay in control of the conversation without taking your hands off the wheel.

38843311 Very happy about this hands free set. Does what it supouse to do, i can drive and talk without holding my phone.

This GPS features a 7" touch screen with QuickSpell technology to help you find your destination quickly and efficiently. The AAA TourBook feature and more than 6 million points of interest guide you toward interesting and useful destinations.


..

38843311 It would not ever start with the connector plugged in. It would think that I was trying to hook to a PC for updates. I had to get the map up on its own battery power, then plug it in, and most of the time this would work. It would turn on and off randomly3 times in just a 30 minute drive when testing how it worked. After just 2 days we came to the conclusion that the power source connector was probably bad, but was not happy with the quality where it would not work out of the box. Bought a Garmin and we are very happy with it.

38843311 Absolutely the worst piece of electronic equipment I have ever purchased.
Got it for my wife because of the big screen.
Returned the first one because it made a horrible screeching noise every time the sound activated.
Second one did the same thing, we said,"screw it". And turned off the sound.
Takes several minutes to pick up your position, and if the buildings around you are more than two stories high, forget it, you're on your own.
Generally lags about three blocks behind your actual position if you are daredevil enough to drive over five miles per hour.
Can't find most points of interest, and not likely to be able to successfully navigate to the ones it does find.
Eventually stopped displaying at all.
Returned second one for a refund. Will never buy another Magellan product.

..

38843311 easy to set up and update. found easiest to enter zip code first,,when entering an address ,blue tooth wont reconnect after turning gps off every time.

..

38843311 This is my 7th Magellan 9055-LM... YES, that's right my "SEVENTH"!
After owning this model for nearly one year, this is what you should expect. These units are wonderful when they work. The A/V IN PORT is awesome for playing movies on the 7" screen from your ipod or your iphone or any other device with a "VIDEO OUT" jack for playback.
The unit works perfectly as expected, but beware of the "Software Glitch", the unit will "freeze-up" and will continue to try to calculate a route for several minutes and then display an error message. Once this has happened it's back to Best Buy to exchange it for a new unit. Most of the time its been several months before this happens, but once it does, the unit simply will not work properly any longer.
Thank you Magellan, for the "ONE YEAR WARRANTY".
Great unit when it works, but NOT very reliable at all.

..

38843311 Nice size screen and very clear. Easy to operate and set up.

..

38843311 I paid a fortune for this piece of junk one reason - it had the largest screen size. Now I want to pitch it out the window after yet again finding the POI was not even in existence, let alone in the wrong location. We took this on a trip through the western US and Rockies and it had no idea how to route us through southern UT. Had we followed the instructions we would have gone hundrfeds of miles out of our way to get to Zion Natl Park. The battery quit working after a few weeks. Now if it is unplugged more than 10 seconds it powers down. The device is so heavy it's own mount can't keep from falling over and pulling the suction cup off so now we have it on a "sandbag" style mount and juet let it sit on the dash. If you want to avoid a highway or part of a route - sorry but there's no option to do that. Want an alternative route? Sorry won't do that. The screen needs to be punched with your fingernail to make it respond. Basically this product totally sucks. It was my first - and LAST, Magellan product.

..

38843311 I can't believe there are not more reviews of this product.
WARNING: Do NOT buy this without a warranty.
I bought my first one in August of 2011. I am now waiting for my 4th one. The second died while I was in San Diego, and the 3rd one died two weeks ago when I was in New Mexico. Guess what? These devices were fully charged at home and PLUGGED in the whole time in the car, and they still died. Sometimes they would not turn off (I knew when that started to happen at 3 or 4 weeks, that it would not be long before the whole unit died); then they won't turn on. Powered in the house, and always plugged into the car (after showing on-off problems), #3 vibrated like a phone and then died. Worst yet, the price has dropped by $77, and I know now the battery is JUST TOO SMALL. It does have some annoying problems, like wanting you to pass your turn and go and make a U-turn, but I could overlook the problems, if the darn thing would just not up and die. Oh, THERE IS NO ONE IN THE US YOU CAN TALK WITH ABOUT THIS (I spent 1hr45min with a "manager" in the Philippines). ALso, checking on-line, I find Magellan, Garmin and TomTom are now owned by the same foreign company...

..

38843311 Do not waste your money. Difficult to navigate,map updates aren't the greatest,kept powering off and losing destination settings. I will never stray from garmin again.

..

38843311 Perfect for me. It is not intended to be mounted up above the dash. The long mount allows you to attach to the windshield, the arm rests on the dash, and the unit is actually below the dash. Just mount where it doen't block your gauges etc. I had some problem with responsiveness of the touchscreen buttons and sync to my iPhone. Sent email to Magellan and within an hour had the fix - reboot the software by holding the on button to the on position for 10 seconds. WORKED.

..

38843311 Purchased this GPS in December of 2011 and to this date can not check for the free updates, the content manager ties my machine up and end up doing an end process to get out of it. Support contacted me in December and I have not heard from them since. A product is only as good as the support you get, and for now, mine is worthless.

This expandable phone system features DECT 6.0 technology for interference-free calls and caller ID that lets you see who's calling before you answer.


..

38843311 I purchased this product and one of the phones stopped working after about 30 days. When I contacted Best Buy to return it, I was told that the Geek squad would have to look at it first to determine the problem. Seeing the Geek squad often takes one hour which is riduculous! I then called Motorola customer service and they were not at all helpful. When I asked to speak to a supervisor, I was told they were not in and they would call me back. That was 6 weeks ago. I will probably not shop at Best Buy again and doubt that I will purchase a Motorola product again.

..

38843311 Good phone set - but a little hard to read the display.

Motorola BR50 Lithium Ion Cell Phone Battery - Lithium Ion (Li-Ion) - 720mAh - 3.7V DC


..

38843311 Dad needed new batteries for his phone. He didn't want to spend more at a local place so he had me find cheapest batteries and order them. We purchased two. These batteries were horrible!!! 1. They look used and like a refurbished products. No where on the best buy page does it say new or used and that is partially my fault for not looking closer but if it doesn't say used or refurbished most buyers will believe it is a new item.
2. Only one would charge. I have tried to contact for returns and site is giving me run around.
Never buying this from this company again and best buy shouldn't sell there sell their products.

I had read a couple reviews that JBL's are a bit muddy, NOT AT ALL. smooth bass very warm and the tweeters liven up everything. overall great addition still going to add a small sub to fill things out but I am very pleased with these!

METRA 44-PW22 Antenna


..

35517344 I have been working on my car, trying to get it in perfect mechanical conditon and this is just another repair. My factory antenna was broken so I went to Best buy to repair it and this one is perfect, but it is extremely difficult to install, but it was worth it because I wouldn't go anywhere else. They take very good care of my vehicle audio equipment and I don't hesitate to go to go back there if there's any problem.

This Metra 95-5822B installation kit features a double DIN provision to update your 2009 or later Ford F-150 with an aftermarket radio. The matte-black finish will match your vehicle's dashboard.


..

35517344 This is not the faceplate for a 2012 Ford F150XLT Supercrew w/out Sync. BestBuy needs to reclassify it!! Even their GeekSquad Installer was puzzled why they classified it for this vehicle. There should only be one slot in the top middle with Hazard Light switch, Stability Control, and Passenger Airbag activation light. The GeekSquad Installer had to make a piece of plastic to fit in the extra slot. He was going to charge me $20 extra but I threatened to get the manager over there and show what I ordered. Get your products right Best Buy!!!!!

35517344 Installed by geek squad and already falling apart 2 weeks later. When I called and told geek squad his response was "cool". Great job best buy and geek squad. Not a happy customer considering the money I spent.

..

35517344 Plastic frame does not match with the interior color of the car but just did some sanding and paint with low gloss black. Came out great. Matches interior perfectly. Saved 50$ over a JDM kit with just a little labor.

METRA XSVI-6502-NAV Wiring Kit


..

35517344 I have a 2005 Dodge Durango. Based on Metra's website, this is the wiring harness they recommended. I was skeptical since the harness had extra connections (for navigation) that I didn't need. But I took the gamble and ordered it anyway. The descriptions says for navigation and non-navigation. It worked perfectly. I bundled up the wires I didn't use and tucked them out the way during installation. I recommend to anyone that needs this particular harness. It's what the professionals use and I completely trust the Metra brand for all my car audio needs.

These MEElectronics EP-A151P-BK-MEE balanced armature earbud headphones feature an in-ear design with an over-the-ear form factor that provides a supportive fit for directing sound into the ear to produce deep bass and extended frequency response.


..

40168448 Headphones and your likes and dislikes are an extremely subjective thing. My primary use for these are for recreational listening. I am a voice over artist....(artist term used loosely) When I am ready to watch a movie or listen to music the 151p is usually the first set I get out of the bag. What I look for in an IEM, or over the ear headset, is accuracy in the reproduction of the material that I am listening to or watching. The 151P does not disappoint. Lows are tight and have correct balance with the low mids...so the bass doesn't sound "boxy". It is however not over driven which most times will dull the rest of whatever you may be listening to. Mids and highs are crisp and accurate. Overall if you are coming from a more low end driven set...they may sound "bright".....Vocals are positioned right where they need to be. They are also among the WIDEST sounding headphone I've ever owned....great for movies . If I could sum them up...they are very a very HONEST sounding pair of IEM'S and are actually one of my go-to mix references when I'm working. Just my 2 cents....for the money..THE BEST. Also MEElectronics support after the purchase is legendary.

..

40168448 Oh my great goodness, The instrumentation is wunnerful, but if you like vocals? forget it. They sound like they are far, far away, or in a well. I am listening on a HP Touchscreen 600. Cheap headphones or earbuds are fine! but these? I am totally amazed/perplexed at the inability of these to capture and properly position vocals.

These MEElectronics Air-Fi AF32 headphones feature Bluetooth technology for simple connection to most Bluetooth-enabled devices and built-in controls for managing music playback and phone calls. The 32.8' wireless range allows freedom of movement.


..

40168448 Purchased for my 13-year old daughter. She didn't have any problem getting the Bluetooth to pair with her iPhone without my help. She uses it a lot and I haven't heard any complaints about the battery going dead in the middle of use. I assume she uses it for phone conversations too, and hasn't told be of any problems.
Probably not the headphones of choice for an audiophile, but for a kid who tends to lose or break her electronics, this is a good value for the money -- and the sound is plenty good enough for what she listens to.

..

40168448 It has great sound quality, with very good base response. Comfortable to wear. Problem is the left ear no longer gives any sound, or barely audible. Want to return.

..

40168448 I read a review on amazon and I should of taken her advice , stops working ALL the time .too late to return to BB so the mfg. sent a replacement and the same thing , stops working .. now the mfg. will give me a credit for a more expensive set by the same mfg. that's like throwing more $$$$ for a product that well still stop working . and by the way , BB was no help at all with this product .....

..

40168448 Initially bought these for gaming so that I could chat with friends (on Ventrillo) and not have that cable drooping over my arms. Didn't work out. But the more I researched I found that it wasn't the headphones fault, it was Bluetooth in general. Bluetooth won't process a microphone in mono and stereo audio at the same time. The result is using your device in pure mono. Not so great. Again, not the headsets fault. So with this in mind, I don't game with the device using Bluetooth, I use my other wired gaming headset.
All that aside, I love this headset. It was only $59, and I use it daily. I use it for my Galaxy Note 8, PC, Motorola Droid Razr Maxx when I'm not home, and at the gym.
The fit is just right for my head, and I like how it's very light. I don't feel like I have a giant headset on that can come flying off If I move my head to quickly.
The sound is superb, I was extremely surprised how good the bass was. I typically listen to Hip Hop and House music, so that was key for me. I bought these online, so I was worried they would not meet my needs. But they did.
The Bluetooth connection is decent. Although, my other headsets have not been any better. I imagine this is probably related to the fact that my entire house is wireless. My wife and two kids use tablets daily, their gaming consoles are wireless, in addition to their laptops and my wifes PC. That combined with our wireless Smart TV's, and wireless stereos in the bathrooms... we have alot of RF floating around in the house. I'll cut this a break. I can typically walk about 30' away before it starts to break up. Although, I think this is the maximum that the FCC will allow, so no heartache there.
The device pairs quite easily, and I use it on several devices, so I don't have any complaints in this department.
Battery life is actually really good. I can go 3 days or so using it for about 4 hours a day. I don't let them sit on the charger when not in use, because that is probably bad for any device. When I go to charge them, the connect is bad, so I have to let the headphones sit at an angle on top of the connector so that it gets a good connection and charges. I'm sure it's the cable and not the headset, as the headset comes with a wired cable so that you can use this headset in wired mode.
Using the headset in wired mode is a really nice feature, as if I'm low on charge I don't have to seek out a new headset.
The headset also folds up for easy storing, and they provide a nice little felt bag in case you need to pack these up for traveling. Nice touch if you ask me.
That's my review, hope this helps somebody out.
I highly recommend these if you're looking for a headset that is cheap and really meets these primary needs:
Great Sound
Easy to Pair to multiple devices
Long life and charges using a USB plug
Folds up for easy packing
Comfortable fit

..

40168448 I was surprised by the sound of this unit. The bass is really good.

..

40168448 Good for the price, but slips off of your head if you bend over.

..

40168448 Work only for 2-3 days and after that i am trying to connect and it is not detectable .................. and facing lot of issue while connecting them

..

40168448 For the money, these are excellent headphones. I use for calls, streaming music and video. Great sound and works flawlessly!

..

40168448 For this price point my expectations were limited. I was wrong. The connectivity is smooth and precise. The sound quality rivals corded systems, and you get a cord as an alternative to bluetooth. The build quality and look and feel is exceptional. Buy this product.

..

40168448 I would recommend this to anyone who is needing wireless head phones for personal type of applications. Nice volume, nice look and feel. Great all around.

..

Enjoy music, gaming and phone calls wirelessly with these Air-Fi Matrix HP-AF62-CF-MEE over-the-ear headphones with a built-in microphone, Bluetooth and NFC capability. ComfortTouch ear pads offer a pleasant listening experience.


..

40168448 I was a little skeptical when I placed this order - I thought the headphones would be decent - but, because of the price, I wasn't expecting great. The sound is crisp, not too heavy on the bass; for the price, I don't think you can beat them. I've used Bose, Dr Dre, and others - I would buy these instead, save $200, and use that to purchase more music!

..

40168448 I LOVE IT WHEN I GO WALKING I LISTEN TO MUSIC AND I ANSWER MY INCOMING CALL EASY TO USE YOU CAN HEAR VERY CLEAR DE MUSIC WITH A GOOD BASS SOUND ...

..

40168448 I have been using Meelectronics headphones for about a year and a half now. I started out with the Venture and recently upgraded to the Matrix 2. These things are fantastic. When hooked up to the detachable chord, the sound quality is better through the highs, mids, and lows than the big brand Beats. What is amazing is when they are unplugged and in bluetooth mode, the sound drop off that is expected from the bluetooth compression is not noticeable. I only have to charge them every couple of days, but even when they are "dead", they are still functional when corded. Easily the best bang for my buck I have ever had in a pair of headphones. I am sold on this up-and-coming company.

..

40168448 I have a lot of airport time in my profession and was looking to get a decent set of headphones I could afford to loose or damage with travel.
I read the specs on these and the looked good on paper so I thought I'd risk it. The price is right so even if they sounded horrible I could live with it or pawn them off on my kids.
The sound is exceptional, especially for an entry level set of cans. They in no way compare to my Sennheisers, but they also don't cost several hundred dollars.
I have 2 complaints: The controls and the fit.
The controls will take some getting used to, but not a deal breaker. The buttons could be a little larger
My real beef is that they aren't really over the ear. They seem like almost a hybrid of over the ear and on the ear. Mostly over the ear. Had I known this at purchase time I would have opted for something else.
Nonetheless, the damage is done.
They seem comfortable and the build quality is pretty good. Again, we're talking about about some cans that are less than $100.
I would absolutely recommend them to a friend, but I would make sure they knew they weren't truly over the ear headphones.
Truth in advertising my friends. Truth in advertising.

..

40168448 I use it mostly at the gym. No wires is great. Battery life is great. I never lost charge and I recharge once a week or so. Sound quality is great to me. Good at blocking outside noise.

..

40168448 These headphones are first and foremost mean to be used as headphones to listen to music, watch videos, and play games or similar activities on your phone, tablet, or notebook. And for that sound is what matters most - the sound on these is excellent, on par with much more expensive wired headphones. It's great to get that sound without the wire! But I love that these headphones do offer a wired option in case you're on a plane and want to use their entertainment system or your battery runs out or for whatever you need. The battery on these last a long time per the specifications which is great. The controls are pretty easy to learn/get use to using without looking.
The only downside is that they don't function as a standard BlueTooth Headset would. Yes, you can answer calls with them and you can definitely use them to talk - they work great for that! But you can't use them to initiate calls by saying a name or to communicate with your phone by voice like when using voice control apps like Google Now. But, I didn't really get these to use as a headset - I got them to use as BT headphones. The fact that I CAN use them to talk to someone is an extra bonus.

..

40168448 I LOVE THESE HEADPHONES!! Was considering the Beats By Dre Bluetooth Headphones, but looked up these headphones and thought they would be worth a shot since they are "over the ear" headphones versus "on the ear headphones." They have plenty of stretch for those with a larger head also. There is excellent sound quality with these headphones also. The bass is crisp and sound is clear. While they are "noise isolating" and not "noise cancelling" headphones, they pretty much cancel out noise around you as I can be at the gym and if someone tries to talk to me and they are right in front of me, I can barely (if at all) hear them talking. I have gotten several compliments about these headphones when I have let people try them out (my boyfriend, my father, a couple friends) and a few of them have even purchased their own pair.

Wirelessly stream audio stored on compatible devices with these MEElectronics Air-Fi Metro EP-AF71-BK-MEE earbud headphones, which feature advanced Bluetooth 4.0 with multipoint support for simultaneous connection of 2 Bluetooth-enabled devices.


..

40168448 These are the first Bluetooth IEMs Ive seen, and I have to say Im impressed with the sound quality. Its not quite up to the standards of the best wired IEMs but the no-wire convenience of Bluetooth more than outweighs its sonic shortcomings.

..

40168448 Worst ever. Did not work out of box. But forget that. If they did, the sounds were terrible. One ear worked and it sounded awful. They did stay in my ears, but they sounded horrific. I wasted my time. Do not bother. Check out my review on YouTube @ http://youtu.be/dzudB-JbDiQ.

..

40168448 how could they make a headphone with one of the best sound quality and can't figure out how to make this piece stay in your ears, this absolutely don't make any sense. I'm giving one star because I'm trying to prevent someone from buying this and wasting their time and money like i did. it's also pain in the rear to charge this thing. AND if you go to the gym, DON"T even think about buying this, you will regret it! I will be returning this before 15 days.

The device pairs quite easily, and I use it on several devices, so I don't have any complaints in this department.
Battery life is actually really good. I can go 3 days or so using it for about 4 hours a day. I don't let them sit on the charger when not in use, because that is probably bad for any device. When I go to charge them, the connect is bad, so I have to let the headphones sit at an angle on top of the connector so that it gets a good connection and charges. I'm sure it's the cable and not the headset, as the headset comes with a wired cable so that you can use this headset in wired mode.
Using the headset in wired mode is a really nice feature, as if I'm low on charge I don't have to seek out a new headset.
The headset also folds up for easy storing, and they provide a nice little felt bag in case you need to pack these up for traveling. Nice touch if you ask me.
That's my review, hope this helps somebody out.
I highly recommend these if you're looking for a headset that is cheap and really meets these primary needs:
Great Sound
Easy to Pair to multiple devices
Long life and charges using a USB plug
Folds up for easy packing
Comfortable fit

40168448 I was surprised by the sound of this unit. The bass is really good.

..

40168448 Good for the price, but slips off of your head if you bend over.

..

40168448 Work only for 2-3 days and after that i am trying to connect and it is not detectable .................. and facing lot of issue while connecting them

..

40168448 For the money, these are excellent headphones. I use for calls, streaming music and video. Great sound and works flawlessly!

..

40168448 For this price point my expectations were limited. I was wrong. The connectivity is smooth and precise. The sound quality rivals corded systems, and you get a cord as an alternative to bluetooth. The build quality and look and feel is exceptional. Buy this product.

..

40168448 I would recommend this to anyone who is needing wireless head phones for personal type of applications. Nice volume, nice look and feel. Great all around.

Pair these MEElectronics Air-Fi Runaway HP-AF32-GW-MEE wireless on-ear headphones to a Bluetooth-enabled device to enjoy stereo audio. Built-in controls and a microphone make music playback and headset functionality easy.


..

40168448 Purchased for my 13-year old daughter. She didn't have any problem getting the Bluetooth to pair with her iPhone without my help. She uses it a lot and I haven't heard any complaints about the battery going dead in the middle of use. I assume she uses it for phone conversations too, and hasn't told be of any problems.
Probably not the headphones of choice for an audiophile, but for a kid who tends to lose or break her electronics, this is a good value for the money -- and the sound is plenty good enough for what she listens to.

..

40168448 It has great sound quality, with very good base response. Comfortable to wear. Problem is the left ear no longer gives any sound, or barely audible. Want to return.

..

40168448 I read a review on amazon and I should of taken her advice , stops working ALL the time .too late to return to BB so the mfg. sent a replacement and the same thing , stops working .. now the mfg. will give me a credit for a more expensive set by the same mfg. that's like throwing more $$$$ for a product that well still stop working . and by the way , BB was no help at all with this product .....

..

40168448 Initially bought these for gaming so that I could chat with friends (on Ventrillo) and not have that cable drooping over my arms. Didn't work out. But the more I researched I found that it wasn't the headphones fault, it was Bluetooth in general. Bluetooth won't process a microphone in mono and stereo audio at the same time. The result is using your device in pure mono. Not so great. Again, not the headsets fault. So with this in mind, I don't game with the device using Bluetooth, I use my other wired gaming headset.
All that aside, I love this headset. It was only $59, and I use it daily. I use it for my Galaxy Note 8, PC, Motorola Droid Razr Maxx when I'm not home, and at the gym.
The fit is just right for my head, and I like how it's very light. I don't feel like I have a giant headset on that can come flying off If I move my head to quickly.
The sound is superb, I was extremely surprised how good the bass was. I typically listen to Hip Hop and House music, so that was key for me. I bought these online, so I was worried they would not meet my needs. But they did.
The Bluetooth connection is decent. Although, my other headsets have not been any better. I imagine this is probably related to the fact that my entire house is wireless. My wife and two kids use tablets daily, their gaming consoles are wireless, in addition to their laptops and my wifes PC. That combined with our wireless Smart TV's, and wireless stereos in the bathrooms... we have alot of RF floating around in the house. I'll cut this a break.

Listen to music stored on a compatible Bluetooth-enabled device with these MEElectronics Air-Fi Venture HP-AF52-BK-MEE headphones that feature Bluetooth capability for wireless audio playback. Neodymium magnets and 40mm drivers offer rich, dynamic sound.


..

40168448 I wanted to cut the wires especially if I'm using headphones when working out. Thus the MEElectronics - Air-Fi Venture Stereo Bluetooth Wireless Headphone made sense based on the attractive price and the overall good reviews it received. Overall the sound is good and probably is comparable to the more expensive wireless headphones. As far as small dislikes, I find when I workout and get sweaty, the headphones become a bit uncomfortable. Also the controls are somewhat confusing as at times when I try to shut off the headphone from the music on my I phone, the MEElectronics - Air-Fi Venture Stereo Bluetooth Wireless Headphone dials the last phone number I called. Finally a little color other than black would make the headphone more stylish.

..

40168448 Air-Fi Venture Headphone are just as great as an expensive set of headphones. I really love the clarity and the noise reduction features, also the Bluetooth feature.

..

40168448 This is my first bluetooth headphones and so far am not disappointed.

..

40168448 I've had these for only a week thus far. They are very light and have good sound. The fit is good. The only drawback is that they feel fragile like they could break. Would highly recommend for the price. I've worn them while walking and they are secure without compressing my ears or head.

..

40168448 Very comfortable. Bluetooth is great. Buttons are a little too close together.

..

40168448 These headphones are def on par with a lot of higher prices products on the market. They do a decent job of reducing the outside noise and produce really good sound. I have used it with on phone calls without issue. You can't beat it for the money.

..

40168448 Very pleased with quality and sound for the price. However, I do miss the noise cancellation feature of my old inexpensive corded noise cancelling phones. These phones sound better and I certainly don't miss the cord. But, a surprising amount of ambient sound can be heard with these phones.

..

40168448 These are bass beasts! The sound quality is surprisingly good over bluetooth and they're perfect for long listening sessions as they're really comfortable and the battery lasts an age. The bass does tend to overshadow the rest of the frequency range, and I'm not entirely convinced by the design, but these are fantastic headphones nonetheless.

..

40168448 These headphones are the best I have ever owned! This company cares about its product. The Headphones are super comfortable, and dynamic HD sound. The bass is enhanced for all music genres, and also for listening to talk radio or sports.
I feel so lucky to own them for a great deal at BB.
Merry Christmas, my wife did a wonderful job on this gift!

..

40168448 I use my headphones while at work and they definitely last the entire day and then some. After my initial charge out of the box (2 Hours) these headphones lasted a week and a half of heavy daily use. I watch hours of Hulu Plus, and listen to Pandora non stop and these last throughout all. 18 hours of battery life and not to mention the quality of the leather used to make this product is outstanding. They adjust for my fat head and the phone calls are crisp and clear. The one touch use will communicate with my phone is awesome. My galaxy note 2 never has to be touched since I can control everything from my Headphones. And if the battery ever runs out, they included a 3.5mm cord to attach and use them as regular headphones! Get these now!

..

40168448 
Experience detailed and accurate sound with these headphones that feature a microbalanced armature driver, capable of delivering balance and deep bass.


..

40168448 Compared to other balanced-armature earphones out there, these offer incredible value for money. They accurately reproduce your music with fidelity and detailed finesse, at half the price of their competitors. Impressive stuff!

..

40168448 I mostly listen to audiobooks on a clip zip. I am very pleased with this purchase.

..

40168448 Sound great for the price. Not super bass heavy but that is good for me

..

40168448 They cut off ambient noise at the gym and fit well down in your ears. They don't work well with the cord over the ears, they work best with it hanging down.

..

40168448 I bought these on BB 1 day deals great price or so I thought I returned them the next day. No bass at all. Sound quality was terrible. I tested them against the Ipod headphones and then against some very cheap ear phones. The sound was terrible compared to the cheap ear phones and even worse against the Ipod's. Don't waste your money on them.

..

40168448 As with most single armature headphones, imaging and mid & high end are clear and accurate. Bottom end is a bit weak, but accurate. Nice build quality, and no-tangle cord are a plus at this price point.

..

40168448 Bought these to listen with my iPhone. Totally pleased with their performance!

..

40168448 Overall good headphone. Wish bass was little deeper. Great price and great comfort.

..

40168448 I purchased these earbuds because I wanted something comfortable I could wear while sleeping. I was looking for something that had noise canceling ability to help drown out or at least muffle the sound of my husbands snoring. These do the trick. I even find I can have the volumn on low and still get the benefits I need.

..

40168448 I have several pairs of earbuds and these fit the best and have the best sound quality.t.

Keep your music and your style in sync with these MEElectronics EDM Universe EP-D1P-BK-MEE earbud headphones that include a 2-tone cable, color-matched case and EDM wristband. An in-line microphone makes it easy to chat on the go.


..

40168448 As I said above, Great sound for the price .... looks nice too....

..

40168448 These have to be the coolest headphones I've bought  great design, and even better sound thats perfect for thumping dance tracks. I also love the flat cable, its not only stylish but stops the usual tangle frenzy when getting them out of your pockets. The perfect EDM (electronics dance music) IEMs!

..

40168448 
These headphones feature a closed-back design for sound isolation and 40mm dynamic drivers for balanced and powerful sound. Includes a soft carrying pouch for convenient portability.


..

40168448 This is my 2nd pair. Really a surprisingly good sound for the price. Can't go wrong. I use them at the gym & while working around the house. Quite comfortable with good bass.

..

40168448 Even after recommended burn in time these headphones did not live up to the hype. Went with the Panasonic hdj-1500 instead.

..

40168448 This is a nice pair of headphones for the price, well built and comfortable with a few reservations. The bass is somewhat strong but takes a backseat to the treble and mids which are very forward sounding and are most prominent in your ears with the bass in the background being overshadowed by the highs in your ear. I have tried to get used to this and for the price point it isn't a majot issue but it is enough to make me choose my AKG's every time over these headphones. If you like the forward in your ear sound of the highs and mids then you will like these. I personally think there are better options although at this price point these headphones do have a lot to offer in overall sound and build quality.

..

40168448 You won't be able to get a better pair of headphones for the price!
Ultra comfortable & surprisingly good sound quality for a budget price!
I would highly recommend for anyone looking for a good pair of headphones at a good price (Why spend more and get less).

Utilizing dual drivers, each with a dedicated subwoofer and crossover, these MEElectronics M-Duo EP-DD53P-BK-MEE earbud headphones produce robust, dynamic audio with enhanced bass response. The in-line microphone allows clear communication.


..

40168448 I use these earbuds on a daily basis for talking on my iPhone and when I go for a walk/run/jog. They have different earbud sizes and styles. The sound quality is execellnt and it is awesome for noise cancellation. One of the best pair of earbuds that I have owned. I have had them over a month and have not had any problems. I just wish it had the controls for the volume on the mic remote. I would have given it 5 stars if it had the remote for volume control.

..

40168448 The M-Du0 earbuds are amazing, I would first like to say the packaging and travel case for them present the earbuds very well, as far as sound goes they are amazing, they are good for rap,bass,classical,rock exc. they are very comfortable and stay nicely in the ear (many tips for swapping). I love the earbuds and you will to, do not hesitate, DJ quality. Professional Quality!

..

40168448 I did not expect such a tiny woofer to provide such deep bass. The highs are very nice, as are all of the MEElectronics headphones I own. The M9s were my favorite, but the M-Duos have the same great clarity with added thump. The bass is not muddy & muffled, but clear & strong. Like the M9s, they are quite comfortable to wear. I go with the double-flanged deep tips, which give the enhanced bass performance. I am very happy with these headphones.

..

40168448 I have tried MEELectronics earbuds in the past and loved them. So I figured I would give the Duos a try, and I'm glad I did! This was my first pair of multiple driver earbuds so I was skeptical on how they would sound. One driver is for highs and mids and there is a driver for bass! These earbuds are very well balanced and they challenge my much more expensive Sony XBA 4IP, which has 4 drivers. Don't get my wrong, the Sony's do sound really good, but these earbuds give them a good challenge. And especially when you look at the prices between the two. I have several earbuds and headphones and the Duos a lot of them to include a couple of my headphones. So for great earbuds for the price, these are the ones you want to get.

..

40168448 Introduction: Im an audiophile that has a penchant for excellent sounding sound equipment. I have always had a deep interest in In Ear Monitors but have recently started to purchase full size headphones as well.
Company Info: From my experience, Meelectronics, also known as Meelec makes some of the best headphones for the price. They also have some of the best customer service that I have ever worked with. www.meelec.com
Product: Meelectronics M-Duo, Metallic Blue
Price: Retail: $80
Specifications:
 Driver: Dual Dyanmic Drivers
 Frequency Range: 10  20000Hz
 Impedance: 16 ohms
 Connector: 3.5mm gold plated
 Cable Length: 135cm/53in
Meelectronics in ear monitors that provide a wider dynamic range as a result of the dual driver system.
Equipment Used:
 My desktop with an Asus Xonar Sound Card
 HTC One
 Fiio E5 amplifier
Packaging and Accessories:The packaging is quite nice, it is a very high-end box with a cross-sectional picture of the headphones showing off the inner workings. It comes with an updated carrying case that provides much more protection compared to the older carrying case as well as 6 different pairs of ear tips as well as a shirt clip. The shirt clip is now much easier to remove compared to the older shirt clip.
Build Quality: The build quality of the earphones is very good, however due to the shape and design, I could easily mistake them for $20 earphones. However, they do not feel like $20 earphones at all; the housings are made of metal, aluminum I believe, and this is what makes them feel extremely durable. The Y-joint and the microphone are both metal and feel very solid. I have taken them to the gym many, many times, and they havent shown any signs of wear, I am extremely impressed.
Isolation: I use the medium sized single flange tips that came installed on the earphones. I find that these tips seal and work with my ears the best. The isolation is slightly above average for an in ear monitor, nothing too crazy like how some Etymotics can be.
Comfort: Comfort for the M-Duos is what is expected for an IEM with such a form factor. Pretty much feel like any other standard mid-range IEM out there. I can wear them for many hours without much discomfort.
Sound Signature: I have used these headphones exclusively for over a month now with burn in periods of pink noise ever now and then.
 Bass: The bass is very clear and detailed. Definitely a bit warmer than neutral, but the bass is very fun and the sub-bass is excellent as well. The lower extension you get with these earphones is just great.
 Midrange: The mids are a bit recessed, these earphones definitely have a V-shaped frequency response curve. Still not too bad, but could be a bit better.
 Highs: The highs have a bit of a roll off but are quite detailed and have a good amount of sparkle to them. I didnt notice much sibilance or fatigue with these earphones.
 Soundstage: Good for an in ear monitor, good enough that I can use them to locate footsteps in First Person Shooting games.
 Conclusion: Fun sound signature that is just solid. Slight mid recession but isnt that bad once your ears adjust.
Songs:
 Four Seasons Winter 1st Mvt. By Vivaldi: Excellent separation and imaging for an in ear headphones. Good speed and accuracy. These earphones are very enjoyable for classical music.
 Dont Give Up On Us by Avicii: This is where I think the M-Duos really shine. The bass and sub-bass is rendered beautifully for electronic dance music. Just super fun to listen to with these earphones.
 Fade to Black by Metallica: Enjoyable to listen to, but for this genre of music, I wish the frequency curve was a bit more balanced than its V-shape.
Amped vs. Unamped: These earphones do very well with an amp. With my measly E5 there is a touch more body and a bit more clarity.
Microphone: Very good clarity for a headset microphone.
Conclusion: The M-Duos, as always like the other headphones that Meelectronics offers, is a great bang for the buck in ear monitor that offers excellent sound quality for the price.

..

40168448 The M-Duo is a great IEM for anyone looking for one under $100. It's comfortable, built well, and has a fun sound with plenty of bass that's not overwhelming. Meelec really did a great job making this dual dynamic IEM, very enjoyable to listen to.

..

40168448 I received these headphones a month ago and am extremely pleased with them. First off, as soon as you place them in your ears, they are comfortable to someone who has had problems getting earbuds in the past. Once you plug them in, the true pleasurable sound experience begins. The sound quality is amazing on these headphones. The bass and treble are so distinctively noticeable as rich sounding and blend together to provide an incredible listening experience whether you are listening to The Beastie Boys (Rap), Everclear (Alternative), Train (Pop), Foo Fighters (Hard Rock) or Five Finger Death Punch (Metal). Every nuance in the music is picked up by these headphones and relayed into your ears to give a clean, crisp sound. I have used these headphones on both my Samsung and Apple devices and are, by far, the best headphones I have ever purchased.

..

40168448 The Meelectronics M-Duo is the newest addition to their Signature series of in-ear headphones. Its dual dynamic drivers boast strong and well-extended bass, including a separate woofer and tweeter. I bought the M-Duo directly from Meelec and was pleased to see it did not skimp on packaging or accessories. Accessories include a redesigned hard clamshell case, shirt clip, and 6 sets of tips in various lengths and sizes. The tips are soft and of pretty high quality. Overall, a solid accessory package.
The contrasting color design on the housings makes for an attractive and classy look without being overly eye-catching. The build features beefy strain reliefs all around on a solid, kevlar-reinforced cable. The cable below the Y-split thick and supple and terminates with an extremely robust looking L-plug. Unlike those used on many flimsier "buds", I would not expect the cable of the M-Duo to come apart from normal use. The housings are solid metal and quite bulky, but feel durable. My only worry is that the cable going to the housings is a little thin. The remote/mic is unobtrusive and the mic quality is very good. As with all inline controls, it can potentially be a durability concern. It is too early to tell if these M-Duos will last the test of time but so far the durability seems very good. Mild driver flex is present.
Isolation is decent for a vented design and can be improved using the triple flanges or foam tips, but is at best just above average. Noise leakage is very low and makes up for the isolation somewhat. Microphonics are reduced using the included shirt clip and nonexistent when worn over-the-ear; this does hinder the mic position, however.
The housings of the M-Duo are rather large and heavy, but need only to be shallowly inserted. The stock tips are soft, fit well and are very comfortable. The triple flange tips offer a more secure fit and improve bass response, but trade a significant amount of comfort and can cause gradual ear fatigue. Foam is another option for those willing to routinely replace the fragile tips, but I highly recommend trying out all the included tips first.
-Sound-
The M-Duo fits right in as a flagship addition to the M-Series, offering a fun, yet only mildly V-shaped sound. These IEMs are far from neutral or analytical. The first thing anyone will notice upon listening to the M-Duo is the earthshaking subbass response, which enjoys a powerful boost along with the entire bass range. The result is a dominant and fully extended bottom end that remains well controlled. The bass may lag behind armature models in speed but makes up for this with great impact and control.
The midrange is a touch laid back but does not feel recessed. Male vocals are not quite as forceful but are thickened by the strong bass boost. On the contrary, female vocals and guitars are very aggressive; this sets the M-Duo apart from the typical "fun" sound.
Treble is detailed and sparkly with good extension, but does not come across as particularly sibilant. Cymbals have a natural and impactful sound. There is a slight tendency towards sibilance but nothing near the grating levels I experienced on the JVC FX101 and Philips 3590.
The overall sound is on the warmer side and very energetic across the board. Soundstage depth falls behind by nature of the forward presentation but width, clarity and instrument separation are great.
I mostly listen to rock and metal, and have found these M-Duos to possess great versatility across genres.. My only gripes are that I haven't found the ideal tips for them yet, and isolation could be better. Some will not like that there is no version without an inline remote/mic, but it is a convenient addition for smartphones and seems durable. The M-Duos represent a very solid value at their price point by offering a nice accessory package, outstanding build quality, great usability and an aggressive, clear sound comparable to much more expensive IEMs. A spectacular value, built well and backed by the best customer care I have seen in the business.

40168448 First off, I am not an audiophile in any measure, but I figured I listen to music a lot in my commute ard 2+ hrs round trip (in loud NYC subway) so why not treat myself with better headphones. Given I've broken two Monster Powerbeat (one within 1 month and another in 3 months), used Beat tour and lost both of my Shrue 110 and klipsch all in one week, I started off researching a new pair of headphones, somewhere south of the $200 range.
As I was doing my research, I read some of the reviews for MEElectronic. It markets itself as a budget brand, but with good sound quality. It has some good reviews from reputable sites for some of their signature headphones so I continued my research. Since I was trying to look for some higher price range headphones, I found this M-Duo Dual Driver as their latest model and started my comparison. I compared the specs and the reviews with other more popular brand like UE, Shrue, Monster, Westone, Klipsch.
Based on the paper, M-Duo's specs typically matches with the headphones of these above mentioned brand price rage in the ard $120-$180 range. I went and tried some of them in the stores and I just can't seem to find much of a difference in sound quality to justify the 1.5x or 2x the price diff for these other branded headphones in the same category.
As for the headphones itself:
Pros:
- metal material headphones. very solid. and it doesn't give you the cheap plastic feeling as the other more famous brands do.
- Bass is good enough (certainly not too much) for my hip hop music
- the mid and high is surprisingly clear for my jazz and acoustic/live concert music (which the Monster and Shrue headphones with double the price range that I owned did not provided)
- I like the L-shape headphone jack as I broke the two Powerbeat because the jack was straight up and it bends awkwardly when i put it in side my jean pocket (given the jeans are on the tight end)
Cons:
- metal headphones makes it a bit on the heavy side, but not heavy as in they can't stay in your ears
- since they're metal, the headphones tend to hit each other and scratch one another inside the pouch.
- I wish the remote has the volume button
Bottom line: I am happy with my purchase. I dont' think you can find any dual driver headphones in this price range that gives you the sound quality that M-Duo does. You can always pay more for the more famous brands, but I tend to like the fact of telling ppl I paid 1/2 the price but got something with the same if not better quality to let them know brand is not everything.

40168448 Pros:
*Great V-shaped sound characteristic
*Great build quality
*Comfortable
*Universal Mic and play/pause/call button
Cons:
*I like to wear my IEM around my ear lobe and the angle of the strain relief makes it protrude a bit when coupled with an ear hook (minor)
*For me, the cord length was 6" too long so I coil it and secure with a small velcro strap near the Y-split to reduce potential to snag on things (minor)
I purchased the M-Duo direct from Meelectronics when it first came out. Out of the box, I can tell that the build quality was top notch with a metal housing, kevlar-reinforced cord, and a 90-degree gold-plated plug. The plug is interesting in that there's about a 1/4" gap from the end of the 3.5mm plug to the 90-degree bend. What this translates to is that it can connect to smartphones/MP3 players with the thick cases with no problem.
The cord is long. This could be a good thing for tall people or for those that connect the M-Duo to a laptop/PC and want to reach for something without having it yanked out of their ears. I put this as a CON, but it did not impact my review of the M-Duo.
It took about 80 hours of burn in before the sound settled. I listen on my iPhone 4S and iPod Touch 5th gen. Initial sound impression was that it sounded a little cold (not much mid-bass; no body to vocals or guitar strums) and a little grainy. But after burn in, I noticed a slight warmth in the mid bass region giving it a very satisfying sound. I like to listen to Sublime/ Rebelution and the like, and the bass is amazing on those songs. I also listen to Red Hot Chili Peppers/Foo Fighters and the treble sparkles with energy. They sound great on many of today's popular music genre (Rap, Hip Hop, Pop, Reggae, Rock).
I have to say that the sound is aggressive: it is in your face/ in your head and not as airy (distant) as the Vsonic GR07BE, for example.
I would recommend the M-Duo if you want a fun, aggressive IEM and have a budget under $100.

Get the most out of your music with these headphones that feature 9mm drivers with neodymium magnets for powerful, dynamic audio. The stainless-steel memory wire offers a secure and comfortable fit during workouts and activities.


..

40168448 This is a very solid buy for workout freaks like myself.
Its cheap, durable, and stays put thanks to the memory wire and over ear wear.
Comes with plenty of tips (I prefer biflange) and a neat little clamshell case for storage.
I run, jump, leap, shadow box all day and these will never ever fall out. They look awesome, and they sound really nice for this price range. It's pretty balanced with a little emphasis on bass. The clarity is pretty solid..
Definitely worth buying if you're an active gym rat or just the occasional jogger.
If you want more fidelity, there's definitely more options.. even at this budget range.

..

40168448 When I bought the M6, I had never heard of MEElectronics. But there were some good reviews, so I decided to take a chance. I'm glad I did!
The single most important thing about earphones is the sound quality, of course. Unlike the gentleman who said they have terrible sound quality, I find that the M6 has pretty good sound quality, especially for earphones in this price range. I've tried more expensive earphones that didn't sound as good. There is a fair amount of bass, and the mids and highs are fairly well rounded. I was happy with the way all my music sounded, from easy listening to heavy metal.
The memory wire can make it a little tricky to put these earphones in, when you first start using them. It gets easier once you've used them a few times. It really helps keep them in place when you're working out or doing anything physical.
I'm very happy with the accessories that came with the M6, as well as the overall quality of these earphones.
I also own the M21 earphones by MEElectronics, and I've really come to like this company. They have well made, good quality products, at very reasonable prices.
If you need a good pair of earphones, especially for working out or other physical activities, at a good price, I highly recommend you try the M6.

..

40168448 Just not good. I used the Orange Sennheiser's for running, until they broke. These earbuds can't hold a candle to them. My music sounds terrible.
I had to turn right around to put them back in my car, before I could continue my run.
Spend $10-20 more to get something decent. That's my advice.

Enjoy crisp, high-fidelity audio while you exercise with help from these MEElectronics Sport-Fi EP-M6P2-BK-MEE earbud headphones that offer a sound-isolating design, effectively eliminating distracting outside noise.


..

40168448 I am a runner and work out daily, both indoors and outside. This is primarily my gym work out headbud set for a number of reasons. 1-It seals my ears so fully that even with the volume low I have difficulty hearing things like cars, othe people, animals; 2-Even with the flush design I still get wind whistle; 3-Running with that ridiculously large (and quickly nonfunctional) 'remote' banging under my chin is uncomfortable, and the slider (which makes the short cord allowed from the remote to the ear buds even more unwieldy, snugs up under your chin in an annoying way... Move it to the back, and it is flopping behind you; 4- Sound quality is average at best; 5-Too much cord; 6-The wires/coated cord that are supposed to bend and shape to the tops of your ears do not, and do not retain shape; 6-The rubber on the buds are paper thin and not comfortable.
I am usually easy to please when it comes to earbuds, but I am most dissatisfied with these, and will have to purchase others ASAP. I wanted to like them- the concept is great, the execution and quality is woefully poor.
I was mislead by many glowing reviews, and the only explanations I can determine are: Folks rated who do not use these much or do not have a frame of reference or the quality has decreased significantly in recent time. They are not worth the small price I paid, and are a waste of money.
In summation- don't waste your time or money. This is not a product for serious runners/workout enthusiasts. Best Buy should seriously reconsider offering such a subpar, inferior product.

..

40168448 I tried these earbuds for exercising after trying (unsuccessfully) a number of other models. These are lightweight, comfortable, and stay in place with their over the ear design. The sound quality is very good for the price, the volume and MP3 controls (I use them with my Apple devices) are easy to access and use, and they seem to be quite sturdy. I highly recommend them.

..

40168448 I brought this product off Amazon. But I like it so much I believe it deserves to be given a review on BBY.
Package Includes:
* Zipper Carrying Case ( I use this to hold my iPod Nano + headphone)
* 6 Pairs of Eartips (I hate the double/triple flanges. But love my small single)
* Shirt Clip (This really only comes in handy for me at the gym)
I've always been impressed by the amount of accessories that MEElectronics provides with their headphones and they didn't disappoint this time. But I always like more bang for the buck, so it was really difficult for me to decide between the S6P and the Sport-Fi M6P. They are essentially the same thing, but with different colors and different accessories. Looking back, I wish I brought the S6P since I like the two-tone color more than the M6P's single color plus those two large cases for gym usage is really nice.
Design of the MEEletronics is a bit different from typical IEMs. This particular headphone has the wire hanging off the top ear-lobe with the help of a memory wire. Which is an important point that people must realize before they purchase. I personally have no problem with it since I wear my M16 the same way at the gym to prevent the headphones from falling out. Obviously I sacrifice isolation in M16 when I did that. So I was pretty happy the MEElectronics came out with a sports oriented headphone.
Performance of the MEElectronics M6P was extremely impressive considering the amount of money I paid for it. But to be honest, I have high standards for M6 since I've owned a couple of other MEElectronics headphone. So, I went in expecting to receive more then I paid for and I wasn't wrong. Sounds from the headphone come across as extremely natural, rich and crisp. Clarity is evident from all ranges with no distortion. Bass as usual is a highlight of these headphones. But that doesn't come as a surprise since majority of MEElectronics headphones highlight enhanced bass. One thing to always remember with this headphone, isolation can only be achieved by finding the perfect fit. Without the perfect fit, isolation and sound comes out not as well as one would expect. Thankfully MEElectronics tries to insure perfect fit by providing a wide range of tips.
I used the headphone for everyday use. I take it on a ride through the NYC subway during my commute. Then I use it in the office and at night time it goes with me to the gym. So essentially I get a lot of uses out of the headphone. At every stage of the day, it adapts extremely well to my needs. It helps to drown out the nearby loud commuters and the subway train running on the other track. It might have done its job too well, since I've occasionally missed the conductor's message about train delays. During office hours, it helps to tune out conversations carried by other co-workers and allows me to concentrate on my work. I guess the most impressive use is for the gym. I've tried many pairs of in-ear headphones for the gym and nothing excels like the MEElectronics M6. It stays on tight even when running on the treadmill and doesn't fall off like other earphones. In the past week, I also took it for a 5hr plane ride. I honestly don't expect it to perform like a Bose Noise-Cancelling headphones and it didn't so don't expect to use these to replace your Bose. With that said, the headphone performs fairly well to noise-cancelling headphones. It drowns out a lot of the excess noises and only leaks in some of the airplane noises. Considering I was able to take a small nap through the flight, I found the headphones works very well.
One of the capabilities of the MEEletronics M6P is the inline microphone, remote and volume control. To be honest, i mainly use only the remote and volume control functionality of this headphone. To me it's always been a nice to have but not a necessity when i choose a pair of headphones. But after having and using it on the Sport-Fi M6, it's become a great bonus especially at the gym. In the past, I would always pause the treadmill to fuss with the volume control or suffer through a song I was tired of. Now, its gotten a lot easier to handle. The inline microphones are really not utilized much even though I picked the P version versus the Non-P version specifically for the microphone. It functions exactly as advertised.
In conclusion, the MEEletronics Sport-Fi M6P is a great in-ear headphone that I'm glad I purchased. It's really versatile and fits your everyday needs without having to buy a pair of headphones for regular usage and a pair for the gym. The only big caveat and warning I have for potential buyers is the need to make sure you're ok with the wires hanging from the top of the ear-lobe. Otherwise, I think majority of the people should find this headphone pretty satisfying especially considering the overall bang for the buck value.

6006839330008 Really bulky, camera lens was cover at all times, bought another cover.

6006839330008 I think the product does what it is meant to do, though I haven't dropped or wet my iPad yet. The clip is relatively easy to come off and I already lost it. Also it is rather difficult to open the clip into standing position.

6006839330008 Overall, i'm happy with the purchase, the case it tough, easy to hold, protects the ipad well enough, but the fit isn't perfect. When snapping the device in, one corner of the case wouldn't completely latch on, leaving a bit of give when you apply pressure. If dropped specifically in this spot, the give my lead to damage, but overall its very secure. If you don't mind it not being a perfect fit, for the price, it does the job.

I made a video review of this item. Check it out. Although this product wasn't as rigid as I hoped, it does seem to offer solid protection. Recommend.

Boss 612UA Car Flash Audio Player - 200 W RMS - iPod/iPhone Compatible - Single DIN - MP3 - AM, FM - 30 x AM/FM Preset - Secure Digital (SD) Card - USB - Auxiliary Input


..

6006840420004 This radio is a gem for the money. Having SD and USB inputs is fantastic. I'm soooo happy to take my CD's out of my truck. I wish the volume would stay where it was when I turned off the vehicle but that's a minor thing. The display is great and bright. For the small cost (check about for the best deal on the Web) of this radio ya gotta love it.

..

6006840420004 I bought this deck for $35 for my 1973 VW Bug Sedan and I must say I am impressed by it, especially for the price! Great sound and easy controls. My only gripe is that the random/shuffle function does not actually randomize. I have an SD card with 200 files, and everytime I shuffle the songs it starts on the same one, and plays songs in the same error. I am a programmer and I immediately recognized this as a programming flaw. It's very irritating because when you randomize you want to be surprised, but the element of surprise does not exist with this deck! Additionally, the usb port that is supposed to integrate with iPod gives my iPhone an 'Error,' but that may be a problem with the iPhone. The Aux port works without any sound interference and works great. I like how the deck automatically detects the most recent plugged in item, making switching modes a snap; no scrolling through all the available inputs! Just wish that shuffle worked... If you want a cheap deck, that sounds great and works, and you plan on using an AUX port, this deck might just be for you.

..

6006840420004 Pros: Aux input, USB port, SD card, Nice graphics, Low cost
Cons: Weak radio reception, Controls feel cheap, picks up engine noise, No CD
Bought this for $35. Can't be beat for the price. I transferred all my CDs to Mp3s and I needed a way to connect an Mp3 player to my car stereo. It was cheaper to buy this unit than to buy an adaptor for my JVC and those FM modulators are awful. This unit works great, looks nice, and was easy to install. The controls feel a little cheap, but this is to be expected for the price. The screen is nice and the sound is pretty good. the radio reception is weak and I get some engine whine, but I thing this may be because I did not wire it correctly or wired it poorly. The engine whine is only heard when I turn the volume down to minimum. I really like this deck! Cannot be beat for the price!

..

6006840420004 One installed and worked fine. The other we spent 2 hours having it installed. Had to have it take out because it never would play sound. Then had to have old radio put back in. The one that was working only lasted about 6 weeks. We started the vehicle one day heard nothing but bass because the receiver would not send any signal at all......am, fm. blue tooth, cd, dvd......nothing. Took it where we had it installed and they reset the system. It worked and we thought it was fine. 5 miles down the road it stopped working again. The stereo shop and could never get it to work again.

..

6006840420004 This was for my husband for Christmas. He travels for work and being able to use the stereo for phone calls makes it easy for him to call whenever he wants. He like to be able to watch his videos on lunch breaks. He loves the touch screen, we are hoping I can get one of these for my car at tax time.

Why sacrifice performance for the sake of convenience? With a slimmer chassis, ARMOR is the perfect amplifier when space is limited, and power is required. Indeed, this combination of feature-rich performance and put-it-anywhere convenience is hard to find in the automotive environment; so much so that the ARMOR may well be forging its own product category.

Enjoy DVDs, CD-R and CD-RW discs, WMA and MP3 playback with this BOSS BV7325B in-dash receiver, which features 320W of total output for powerful sound. Bluetooth technology, a USB port and a Secure Digital card slot offer versatility.


..

6006840420004 I owned the BV8728B model -very similar to this one. I bought it in Dec. 2011 and 6 weeks later it failed to work properly. I did have it professionally installed. Since I was past the 30 day online seller return for refund window, I have to return it to BOSS for repair. If then removing it from my vehicle wasn't enough - BOSS tells me that I have to pay for shipping both ways! A $170 unit is now a $250 unit...
How's that for customer no-service!
Needless to say, I won't be purchasing any BOSS products again.
Go with Pioneer or Kenwood for peace of mind.

Enjoy your favorite tunes while at sea with these 2-way marine speakers that feature a water-resistant design to protect against the elements.


..

6006840420004 I was amazed when I turned the speakers on for the first time! The sound quality was amazing. I was skeptical for the low price but did not want to spend a lot of money for speakers to install on a boat exterior where they are exposed to a harsh environment but sine installing them I have been truly amazed at the sound quality and performance of these speakers. i needed a smaller speaker to install in a tight space and these filled the bill perfectly.

..

6006840420004 great value for the price and good quality, easy install.

..

6006840420004 These speakers look good and we're easy to install.

..

6006840420004 These are a good speaker for the money. They look good and have good sound quality.

..

6006840420004 I bought these speakers to repace the Audiovox speakers in my boat, which were the original speakers that came with the boat (for which they had cracked grills and not great sound quality). Although these are 5 1/4 inch speakers, they were just a little larger than the existing speakers, which required the hole to be cut out a little larger to get them to fit flush. The grill covers are very durable (as compared to the Audiovox), and the sound is much clearer and deeper. It came with all the mounting hardware and was shipped directly to my home from BB.
I've used these Speakers in my boat every weekend this past summer and am not disappointed! You can't go wrong with these speakers for the price and quality!

..

6006840420004 bought these for my boat, should work well, but will get to install in the spring when its not covered in snow and ice. Great product for the money

db Link Capacitor


..

6006840420004 This capacitor is a joke, looks good but did not provide even a little increase in performance and after aprox. 4 months of light use it started to leak. I have installed car audio for more than 10 years and I have not seen a more cheesy capacitor yet, this is it. I got a fair deal on it so I thought I would give it a shot, do yourself a favor stay away from this one. Good thing I caught the leak, you get what you pay for.

..

6006840420004 I ordered this shredder and when i recieved it it was damage beyond use during shipping, when i received the replacement i was so excited to try it out! It shreds so tiny you get an awesome sence of security. Unfortunately for us the first time it over heated (5 minutes into my stack of shredding) was the last time it over heated, i couldn't get it to work any more after that (even the next day) I oiled it and everything they way i should have but it must have simply been defective. However, I AM going to buy this shredder again and hope that the next one works for a long time. There are just too many perks with this shredder to not try it again!

..

6006840420004 This has got to be the most silent shredder ever. I think my microwave is louder than this thing. Can barely hear it run. Great mouth and bin capacity, quick shredding. I think the 10 sheet capacity is under estimated as it can easily handle the thickest credit card application envelopes you will receive in the mail without opening and unfolding. The only downside i can see so far is the overheat timer that only lets you shred for 10 minutes straight, then will shut itself off for 15 minutes to prevent the motor from burning out. Overall the quality is unmatched and the shredder weghs nearly 60 pounds, a testimate to the strength and design.

..

6006840420004 This is the best shredder I have ever used. It shreds the paper so small there is no chance of anybody getting your information. When you over use it, it will stop until it has cooled off. And it will also stop if your fingers get to close to the paper slot.

Enjoy your music wirelessly with these iLive IAHB33B headphones that feature Bluetooth 2.1 support to stream music from an audio device up to 33' away. On-ear controls let you adjust your music while keeping your music player safely stowed.


..

6006840420004 After having these headphones for 6 months plus i decided to do a review. overall these headphone great. I love them. first i ordered them and they costed 40 buck at that time i ended up getting them for 32 bucks. They delivered it to my home within 2 days and i did not have to pay for delivery.
From sound quality to how they feel on your head they work wonderful. i only charge my headphones once a week and i do use them daily. (5hr plus) dropped them plenty of times and didnt break. the bass is also awsome. when i have them on at full blast you feel the music. To me these headphones are way better than Dr Dre headphones. the only reason why his are more expensive is because of the name.

..

6006840420004 I noticed that I used a lot of ear buds to listen to. I live in a crazy environment, and I like to listen to music wherever I go, and try not to worry about my headphones, such as its durability. Most ear buds I've used lasts about 5 months (my skull candy ear buds lasted 7 months). Eventually I try to do my best and take good care of my headphones, but I guess I suck at it, because I listen to headphones when I'm walking home, whether it's snowing, cold, and rainy, but I'm not sure if that has to do with my headphone problems, because most of the times it has to do with the wires of the headphones, so I decided (because all of this time I've been using ear buds) why not try something new, like on-ear headphones. So I found these, gave them a try, and right of the box, it had all of the features I loved. No annoying wires hanging around, has a wireless remote, and it is easy-to-use. They surprisingly have excellent audio (sounds about as even as beats solo) for a pair of bluetooth headphones. Has amazing distance, too. The farthest I was from these headphones was perhaps a meter. Now the only thing I didn't like about them is that they aren't very compatible with laptops and computers, because they have really fuzzy, bad audio, but that's not the reason why I got a refund out of these guys.
So of course, I was hoping to have them last very long... not even close. All it took for these to break was one month. So these aren't really durable, to be honest. I accidentally slept with them on my bed one night, and when I tried them out in the morning, the LED light was flashing like crazy as soon as I turned it on, and would not function properly. Because I got the warrant, I decide to get a replacement.
Got new pair of these headphones, and right out the box, it was frustrating. They wouldn't hook up to my iOS device every time I turn it on. Instead, it wouldn't be able to locate the device, so every time I turn off the bluetooth headphones, I would have to pair them up again, and again, and again. Three weeks later, one of the pads of the headphones came off, but that happened when I brought it out of my backpack, so if that's the case (that my backpack could've destroyed it), these are otherwise really fragile, so I got a refund out of these. If you're a person like me, who tries not to worry about its durability, I would look for something else (right now I'm trying out the SkullCandy Crushers, and even though they are wired, they don't tangle on me, already had these for 3 weeks, they work out very nice for me so far), but if you're really good at taking care of headphones, be my guest, but I would still get a warrant to come with it in case it comes out malfunctioned (like if you have to pair it up every time it turns off out of the box).

..

6006840420004 Bought the iLive Bluetooth headphones IAHB33B for my daughter. After 2 months the right swivel snapped off. I called customer service, 888-999-4215. There is a supposed 90 day warranty on the product. Called and talked to someone in India. Was told to call back between 9 AM and 6 PM EST when "a supervisor would be there".
Called back two days later, got someone with a Pilipino accent, and after giving all information, took about 20 minutes. After the representative "consulted" with a supervisor, I was as finally told my case would be "escalated" but I was told to call back on Monday, it was Wednesday. Called back on Tuesday and was told my warrantee claim was "denied". However if I paid $15.95 plus shipping one way , they would repair the headphones.
The worst customer service ever!

..

6006840420004 Fantastic product. I use them while running. Syncs with iPhone easily. Controls on headphones all work with pandora, iPod, etc.

..

6006840420004 I have been looking for a pair of Bluetooth headphones and I saw these on sale and thought I would give them a try. They are great. Nice sounding bass. Great over all sound quality. Very easy to connect to my devices and the best part, no wires. Battery life has been better than I would have expected.

..

6006840420004 I just bought this at FYI for 19.99 and I had my doubts about the product because the price. I brought it home and charged it for an hour or so, synced it up and was very surprised by the great sound. I will go out and buy a couple more tomorrow for my wife and son.

Manage your audio experience with these Jabra REVO 100-55700003-02 on-ear headphones that feature in-line controls for easy call and music adjustment on your compatible device. Memory foam earcups and a padded headband provide a comfortable design.


..

6006840420004 I've had these for about a month now and couldn't be happier. I spend a lot of time commuting and wear these when I commute. The sound quality is great and the fit is very good. They are sturdy but light so travel easily. This is the first Jabra product I have owned. It won't be the last.

..

6006840420004 I used to have a pair of small dre beats, but recently picked up these new jabra revos and I have had no issues so far. The quality is right there and for the price you can't beat it. They are very easy to store and for small looking headphones, they really pack a punch. I would recommend these to anyone especially over wasting 300 bucks on headphones that barely last a year (that's what happened to mine).

..

6006840420004 very nice box but the size is cubic feet is suppose to be 2.25 ft but it is like 1.6 feet no where near what i was expecting dont buy this box its a joke

..

6006840420004 It says measurements are 16.5x17x36 outside dimensions and 2.25 cubic feet per woofer. Actual dimensions when arrived are 16x14x34 outside and only 1.59 cubic feet per woofer! Dont know if this is a mess up by Best Buy or Atrend but someone needs to correct the problem. Unsuspecting customer might not notice. Almost 3/4 of a cubic foot makes a huge difference in operation and sound quality. Also the only 1'' mdf is subwoofer mounting panel and rest is cheap 3/5''.

..

6006840420004 My husband did not realize it would be a little big to fit in the car so he had to make it smaller. It is great though.

..

6006840420004 delay shipping due to the holidays... but overall great!

6006840420004 This product was made for travel but I found another use for it. I needed a power strip with a short cord for use with a TV in my kitchen. This strip works perfectly because I have limited space and don't want a bulky cord. The right angle plug is also a plus.

..

37416167 I recommend this product for the student and for those unfortunate enough to have to work from home. It also is useful at home for an assortment of tasks.

Built-in DSL modemDirectly connects you to the internet wirelessly -no separate DSL modem required. The Linksys X2000 can also act as a wireless router by connecting the Ethernet WAN port to a cable modem.Fast wireless speedThe Linksys X2000 connects your computers, wireless printers and other Wi-Fi devices at wireless transfer rates up to 300 Mbps.


..

37416167 This item worked great for about a month and then it became unreliable. I'd pull it out and find it very hot to the touch. After unplugging and letting it sit for a while it would once again function for about 1/2 an hour, then it stopped working again. If you do a websearch for "X2000" and "overheat" you'll find that this is not an isolated incident for this item. I would not recommend it.

..

37416167 I used this modem in my home which worked fine with my computers, phones and tablet. I started using Netflix and I started having problems. After using Netflix it would loose wifi connections with all my divices and I would have to reboot the modem to re-establish the wifi connections. Streaming was slow and spotty when it would work. Had to return product and purchase another modem.

..

37416167 After finally getting someone in AT&T tech support to work with me I finally got it working properly...works great now.

..

37416167 simplifies my life by having modem and router in one unit. Had up update the firmware after 30 days, but customer support staff was knowledable and quick.

..

37416167 Got this router for my studio about a month ago and it has been great. Very good speed, consistent and haven't had to reset it. The only problem I have had is that for some reason my computer will drop the connection but normally it will log right back on. But I think this may be a problem with my computer. Aside from that it is a great product for what you are paying. And as far as set up, had it up and running in about 5 minutes with minimal effort, and security option are very easy to use.

..

37416167 I've had this modem now for a month and after initial and very easy installation I haven't had to touch it since. The setup CD was awesome and easy to use. When it search for my ISP information and coudn't locate it, it asked me..."what country are you in?" I filled in all the answers to the questions and within 5 minutes I was connected and it's worked flawlessly ever since using both the lan ports and wirlessly.

..

37416167 Purchased this gateway about a month ago and so far so good. This was the easiest and most pain free gateway that I have ever set up/configured. Most other gateway's that I had tried required that you connect a computer via ethernet during setup but this gateway set everything up within five minutes and best of all completely wireless! I have definitely seen an increase in overall coverage in my home and have yet to drop internet connection and the speed is very good. I connect two laptops, one smartphone, wireless printer, desktop, a Wii, and a Directv Cinnema Kit....... I really like the sleek, flat design and the white subtle panel lights as opposed to the green blinking and flashing lights you see with other gateways. This device runs warm but not hot like some I have used in the past ( netgear just to name one) This gateway does install an icon on your computer during setup which allows the administrator to access the device's interface and it lets you customize settings, configure and name your network, etc. What I really like about this device is that it also gives you the option to set up a guest only network so if you prefer to not give out your password to other people you can just have them connect to the guest network; I find this a pretty cool feature that I had not seen in other products I had owned. The only negative I can find about this if I had one is that the same password that you choose for others to connect to your main network is also the same password that allows one into the user interface settings on the computer; if you are going to be the only person using the computer that the interface icon is installed on its not a problem but if that's not the case that could cause some security issues. I set this device up with AT&T DSL and it works just fine! just be sure before you try setting up this device that you have your correct AT&T login and password information and keep in mind your DSL password is not the same as your main account password that you use to sign into your AT&T account to view your bill, etc...so if you know your correct password, etc this device will set up flawlessly! I highly recommend this gateway because its set up is easy, functions well, and has many cool options within the routers interface. I have always had good luck with cisco/linksys products in general and this device was no exception. I highly recommend this product!

..

37416167 Bought a year ago, several internet connection problems with it, warranty has run out & now the router is dead. Time for new router, will NOT be purchasing another Linksys. Isn't there a router that lasts longer than a year???

..

37416167 I bought this router due to the good reviews it had. I can not agree with them. I returned the first one because it would not stay connected and received a replacement. The second one is not any better and may be worse. I will be returning this one for a refund. The only good thing about it is that it is easy to set up. After about one day of use the problems start. I would suggest that you not waste your time or money on this.

..

37416167 This is probably the 5th Linksys router I've purchased. The configuration menus could be a lot better, but I know them well and at least they are consistent amongst the products. Basic installation is easy, though it seemed very slow. More annoying is that advanced config is very slow. The webserver in my other Linksys routers is pretty quick. The X2000 is sluggish. This probably is because the other routers run Linux and the X2000 runs Windows. I haven't tested the range but it seems to be at least as good as the Linksys router it replaced. I bought the new router to replace a very old DSL modem; the old router worked fine.

If you have read other reviews on this site about this product, you should have figured out that anyone who is still using Win 2000 cannot be a reliable source of technical information.

..

37416167 I bought this to connect a pbx wirelessly to my network, but it didn't work because it's not compatible with windows 2000. In the manual it mentions windows 2k for the install but the manufacturer does not list it as compatible. I suppose this is my fault for not checking.

37416167 I bought these to use only for working out. I switch from indoor elliptical and outdoor running, as weather dictates. Indoors, they are great. But, I really bought them to get rid of cords when I run. When I run, the music on my iPhone 5c skips every 8-10 seconds. No joke. Every 10 seconds or less the music is broken up by a quick pause. It's pretty hard to get in a good groove without my music. They're going back...

37416167 A colleague recommended this drive for my office, and I'm quite happy with it. The primary purpose is backup and file sharing. It works well, doesn't take much space, and runs absolutely quietly. The data seems to be well protected (we've set it in RAID5 mode), the administration is easy thanks to the web-based UI. There are plenty of other useful features that we are slowly exploring. I'd highly recommend this system to any small business owner.

Store important files with this external hard drive that features a 500GB capacity and automatic backup to help protect your data. The aluminum casing guards your hard drive against damage.


..

37416167 This product is so simple to use. All you do is plug it in and it basicly does the rest.

..

37416167 Well built, great looking, plus it is very simple to use. Very high quality.

..

37416167 it really comes in handy for job and it makes my life whole lot easy.

..

37416167 I used this drive primarily to backup photos onsite during photo shoots. Excellent speeds through USB 3.0 (40-60MB/s), and a very attractive enclosure. However, once back home from a rather important shoot, The drive indicator light began flashing rapidly halfway through the file dump, and transfer stopped in the middle of the job. I was forced to unplug the drive, reboot (to be on the safe side), and try again. I got the same issue again, still with hundreds of files left. These are super high resolution RAW files, so there was still many gigabytes left. On the fourth time, the drive began making the dreaded clicking sound, indicating a physical failure.
After trying various methods to revive the drive, I simply decided to give up all hope. I took the drive apart and was rather shocked to see the drive itself was nothing more than a 5400rpm seagate momentus. I could have just took a spare drive and slipped it in a USB 3.0 enclosure and gotten the same exact experience for less money. Lesson learned
thankful that my images were still on the original cards.

..

37416167 Agree with all the other 5 star reviews. Excellent product!

..

37416167 I travel a lot and like to take a lot of photos. The problem of where to save the pictures while traveling has always been a challenge. At first, I used to take my notebook with me, but after a while, there was not enough free space left on the internal hard drive. Several months ago, I purchased the Porsche Design. This drive is compact, capacious, very transportable, does not require power cable and the exterior is strong and keeps the data secure while traveling. I'm very pleased with my choice.

37416167 As a graphics student, I needed a large portable drive to easily carry my work around on.

I love the FireWire 800, it transfers my files in no time and it looks great!

..

37416167 Works great. Like the USB plug vs the wireless. Nice responsiveness on keys.

..

37416167 Ok I have had this nice package for about 2 weeks now. And this week since I have been sick with a cold I figured I would put this keyboard and mouse to maximum.
Logitech has always been and most likely still be one of my most favorite companys for computer devices. But with this very package it has its flaws.
I like how the fact that the package says its water proof. For home users that want a keyboard and mouse that is damage proof,.. its good to get a water resistant or waterproof keyboard and mouse but don't forget.. if its waterproof it tends to recieve some very bad negitive effects at the cost it being waterproof.
The keyboard design and layout and the way the buttons feel and work.. is perfect! I give the keyboard a 5 stars because its just perfect and flawlesss! I have had no problems with the keyboard and I just love how solid the keyboard is. I believe it actually feels a little bit better than some of the more expensive ones.
Now for the mouse.. the mouse is what becomes the problem. I am not sure if this is only windows vista only but for some reason when I load browsers on windows vista my mouse acts up and glitches when loading pages. This may not be the case with windows 7. Because I have never tried it on windows 7 as of yet. I got windows 7 at the office I hand out at.
I wanted to replace my old keyboard and mouse because the ones I had were real old and I wanted something to use at home when I am drawing and designing webpages. If all I am doing is designing webpages.. that is ok but when it comes to drawing out images or pictures for your webpages.. or loading google chrome or other browsers the mouse has a fit alot of times. Because the optical laser tends to for some reason to glitch when alot of stuff is loading up.
But other than the mouse picthing a fit every 5 minutes when I am trying to draw on my wacom drawing pad, this package is perfect for those looking for the best deal for home use casual PC usage.
But if you need something to draw with,.. or if your mouse has a fit everytime you load a browser.. than the keyboard is perfect in this package.. ebay the mouse! Because the mouse junk unless you want to save it for an old backup PC.
If you want an awesome drawing mouse I would skip this mouse and jump to the 40-70 dollar logitech gaming mouse mx518. Its been out for a long time.. and if you take very good care of it,.. it will last you 5 years or more like it has for me.

..

37416167 If you want a keyboard without extra buttons and such, this one works. There are no buttons to get to the net or for volume or email. What you get is a keyboard with larger than normal letters and a surface on the keys that your fingers do not slip off of. It is small compared to others. No frills but works.

..

37416167 This is a great keyboard it is compatible with Linux and windows. It had a great price looks nice.

..

37416167 Not much to say about a plain keyboard & mouse. After one month they're still working well.

..

37416167 excellent.i just unplugged old one and plugged it in and now everything matches in color...good basic product not fancy but serves your needs

..

37416167 I purchased the MK120 expecting there to be 2 USB ports on the keyboard as the specifications state. Boy was I surprised when it arrived and there were no USB ports on the keyboard. And when you try to find a support number for Logitech on their website, you could hunt forever and never find one for the US. If you are looking for a cheap P.O.S. keyboard/mouse combo, you found it. If you are expecting what the specs say on the website, run away.

Experience precise performance with this Mionix Naos 3200 000MIO3200M optical mouse that features a 3200 dpi sensor, along with LED-optical technology, for smooth, accurate operation. The built-in memory easily maintains your settings and macros.


..

37416167 I got this mouse thinking that I wanted to go back to a palm style of play after I found that my claw grip on my Razer DeathAdder 2013 was giving my hand cramps after long periods of use. The Mionix Naos 3200 is a dream come true for any palm grippers out there. The contours of the mouse fit right into my hand (I have fairly large hands). The DPI buttons are useful but they don't get in the way. The material of the mouse is phenomenal. It is like a rubberized matte texture that I wish all gaming mice used. The mouse clicks have just enough response so that I was able to click extremely fast, but not too sensitive that I was clicking when I didn't want to. The key selling point for this mouse is the right side. There is a groove so that your ring and pinky fingers have some support while you use it. The software isn't too complicated which I didn't mind since I don't need lots of customization. Also, 3200 DPI was plenty enough for me.
However, although I thought this mouse would be the answer to my computer mouse dilemma, I found that I just wasn't as accurate palming this mouse as I was with using a claw grip with my DeathAdder. I tried to adjust my grip to use a claw style on this mouse, but the groove on the right side isn't really made for it. I only took off one star because of Best Buy's shipping. They shipped it in too small of a box so when I got it the mouse's box was crushed on one side from where they forced it in..
Long story short, If you use a true palm grip, stop looking for mice and get this one. You won't regret it. If you use anything but a palm grip, I would look elsewhere.

..

37416167 I don't use it for gaming just general use. Good fit in hand, rubberized texture. Good quality. I want to get something that had programmable buttons, works great.

..

37416167 So I had been looking for a new gaming mouse, as I have been using cheap mice from convenience stores, which was absolutely horrible. This mouse looked amazing, had a great price, and all around good reviews. Delivery only took around 3-4 days which was great! Upon receiving, I was pleased to see that it had an encasing around the wire and that it looked overall amazing. It fits perfectly in my hand, I have no problem aiming in any FPS such as CS:GO, TF2, and Borderlands 2.
This mouse can also be useful for MOBAs, as the four configurable buttons can be rebound to your spells.
What's not so great:
The mouse installed and worked fine with my computer, however the configuration software, the program that allows you to edit the DPI and other settings, did not come with the package. I had to go online and find it myself, which wasn't too difficult, and after installation I haven't had any problems since.

..

37416167 I would write a long review but I just lost it because it refreshed.
This mouse it great, it gets me what I need and works extremely well. I usually use Green for daily activities and Blue for gaming. To change the color, you press either of the buttons below the scroll wheel. The color also represents sensitivity.
Red- Low
Green- Medium
Blue- High
Wonderful mouse, I recommend it to all.

..

37416167 I needed a replacement for my Logitech MX Revolution wireless gaming mouse. My problem was that I was used to a mouse that fit well in the hand and was erganomically correct for extensive usage while gaming, graphical editing, etc.
After reading most of the reviews online, I decided on this one & was pleasantly surprised. The cord is mesh wrapped instead of the typical rubber wires.
Please also be aware that this mouse is meant to be used with your entire palm rather than just being controlled simply with your fingertips. That is one of the features I was looking for since I was used to my MX Revolution. Also, any other reviews complaining about issues with the mouse picking up movement should you pick it up off the mouse pad are completely false. I've had no issues with this mouse whatsoever.
Terrific mouse!

Berard Cutting Board - For Cutting


..

38487613 I guess I should have paid more attention to the dimensions. The cutting board arrived today and it is tiny - probably about five inches by eight inches. I went back to the website to see if I missed that and the dimensions aren't even listed. My fault for ordering it without the dimension information, but who sells tiny cutting boards!

Quickly and safely slice a variety of foods with this electric slicer that features a multipurpose, stainless-steel blade for versatility and a tilted, large-capacity food carriage that simplifies operation and saves you time and energy.


..

38487613 Its a great product, but what I have found is that when you are slicing meat, and you put a little pressue on the meat to keep it in place to slice, that the thickness control knob makes it thicker and thicker as you slice. Would be nice if the knob had a locking mechanism to lock it in at the desired thickness. This way you dont find out when its too late that you have different thicknesses of meat. Not good for jerky when it does that.
On the possitive, I cut a huge roast frozen for jerky and it cut through it like butter. Will be purchasing the Non-Serrated blade next for deli thin cuts.

..

38487613 
This electric sharpener features automatic knife guides for quick and easy use and is designed to restore or recreate a 15 angle on Asian-style cutlery and a 20 angle on European- and American-style cutlery.

Place your TV on this stand or mount it to the wall or included swivel pole for versatile display options. Two tempered-glass shelves and 2 drawers offer plenty of storage space.


..

37126763 Purchased this thinking it would be nice, but still of OK quality considering the price. Was pleasantly surprised that it was made of solid woods and not veneered particle board. While this is not a $2,000 media stand, it is certainly not in the Bush or Sullivan class as well. The glass is very nice, the wood finish is very nice. It was not difficult to assemble and the hardware was quality. the only issue I had was a screw that came off the drawer glide. They could have been a bit longer, yet they really need to support the guides. I thought to replace them with longer ones and forgot. They seem to be holding up fine. I would definitely recommend this over the particle board stands. It's worth the extra money in the long run.

..

37126763 Very happy with the stand. I have a 60" and it looks perfect. Not oversized.

..

37126763 This Bell'o Triple Play is absolutely beautiful and very well made. I use it as option 1 which is to set the TV on the top and not use the mounting bracket. I have my cable box and VCR setting on the middle shelf and it looks almost empty. The drawers are really handy for storing extra cables, accessories and the owner manuals.
The directions are good and the hardwear is labeled very well but make no mistake about it...assembly takes some time. There must be a zillion pieces to it and I only use the rack and tossed the mounting bracket and post. The hardwear is quality but I had one minor stripping issue. The bolt did tightened up but not completely. I took it out and added a little J B Weld (always keep some handy) and was off and running.
For the price of $450 delivered to my door I feel that it is a great stand and compliments my new 55" Panasonic ST50 Plasma TV.

..

37126763 nice looking piece for any home
be careful with assembly, instruction pictures are misleading/ unspecific

..

37126763 Great looking! Our new TV looks great on this stand. A little costly, but nice looking unit!

Rugged, compact and colorful, with a unique shape that offers unique placement options, SoundWare belongs in a category of one. Enjoy great sound indoors on a desktop or the floor. Or outdoors under the eaves or on the deck. Tuck them neatly into a corner and aim them up, down or sideways. SoundWare is a weather-resistant high performance loudspeaker that redefines the word versatile.


..

37126763 Using these speakers in an outdoor setting and the sound quality is fantastic. Easy installation. Great value for the price.

..

37126763 I've tried several different outdoor speakers over the years, and these are by far the best. The sound is fantastic and the inconspicuous size/design is perfect. The ones I bought are white and the blend into the house trim perfectly. Finally we have decent sounding music outside!

..

37126763 
Enjoy crystal-clear audio with this Boston Acoustics SoundWare XS home theater speaker system, which features an 8" subwoofer with BassTrac technology for robust bass. Bluetooth capability makes it easy to stream music from a compatible device.


..

37126763 I bought this on clearance at my local Best Buy and I have to say that it was probably the best decision I could have made on a home audio purchase. I bought it to replace a Samsung 5.1 system and I think it sounds 10X better. The sound was so good in my living room that I had to get another one to put in my bedroom. I would compare it to the Bose Cinemate with two satellites but at a better price. Boston Acoustics has earned another customer for future purchase. The only downside is the small remote (could easily get lost).

..

37126763 Bought this system for its low profile design. Didn't know what to expect but considering its price, although I got it in clearance, I expected good. After hearing it for the first time, I was beyond amazed. Crystal clear sound with nice deep bass. One of the best purchases I've made. The control pod does become unresponsive from time to time but this is still a great system.

..

37126763 This is an awesome sound system. The only down part is that you have to position the remote signal at the perfect angle. But all in all I would deff recommend this product to anyone!

..

37126763 I did my homework before ordering this product online and I was assured by manufacturer that this product could be added to my present home theater system. After I received it and was unable to hook up to my home theater system I was then told by HIDEF it was not defective and would require a 15% restocking fee, NO customer satisfaction guarantee! This restocking fee WAS NOT mentioned on Best Buy marketplace information on Bestbuy.com website where I ordered it online. BEWARE when ordering from marketplace sellers!! I didn't mind paying for return shipping BUT, I shouldn't have paid a restocking fee when it was returned promptly in Excellent condition. It cost me over $60 to return a $179 item.

..

37126763 My girlfriend wanted a new system to replace my old stereo and speakers that didn't fit the entertainment center and had too many wires. We found this system on deep discount and opted for it over a soundbar. The sound quality was better than I expected, set up was easy and I love that I can use the bluetooth function to play music from our devices.
My only disappointment was that the box seemed to indicate the speakers were wireless. We wanted to mount them in the corners of the living room and not have wires hanging from them (or need to be hidden behind the wall) but that was not the case. We simply placed them on top of the entertainment center and they're still cleaner and smaller than the speakers we had, though.
I'm not sure I would have bought this at full price but the bargain value was definitely worth it.

..

37126763 I think this is a great deal for a bedroom speaker system. It won't replace a surround sound system though. It's sounds as good as bose but costs way less.

..

37126763 Purchased for my bedroom tv setup and have loved it! Great sound, price and ease of setup!

..

37126763 Its hard to review something when you cant even turn it on. I literally bought 3 of these and returned all three because none of them powered on. What a disappointment!

..

37126763 Using this system in a large family room and am very satisfied with the performance. Great for listening to music and watching movies. Have a Bose home theater system in another house but feel this is very close in what it does. Got it at a good price and it was way easy to set up.

..

37126763 Was one of the worst systems I had, didn't go loud as i expected. Was real easy to set up; that was a plus. I had better.

The heart of a stunning 5.1 surround sound system, and brilliant with stereo music tooThe 351R amp delivers superb-quality surround sound, plus stunning audiophile stereo for brilliant music reproduction, at amazing value. Our designers have obsessed over the audio, creating surround sound that truly immerses you in big-screen action and music reproduction so good it will make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up.


..

37126763 Is it possible to be an audiophile with a realistic budget? Is it possible to enjoy watching movies at home, and then listen to great unadulterated stereo sound? Well, no. If you're budget is sky high, then go for it--you can have what you want. But if you have a family, then your "audio toys" will be greatly curtailed. Or will they be?
For years I had been searching for a high quality AV Receiver that didn't have a bunch of undesired, unneeded features. The fact is, I wanted to pay for high quality components with great sound, That's it. And all I wanted was 5.1 channels--our viewing room isn't that large, and 7.1, 7.2, 9.2 simply isn't going to happen and was a waste of money. I didn't want internet, I don't need apps, and I don't need a rack full of legacy inputs.
I could go on about what I didn't want, and if you are like me, then this will resonate with you, and I can tell you that you are looking at a great product which you should seriously consider. If you want internet, or apps, or anything fancy. This is not the unit for you.
When our old receiver was starting behaving badly. I started looking for a new receiver. I thought I was going to get a different low profile unit (that would actually have cost less) then I saw the Cambridge Audio Azur 351R. It was what I had been looking for, for a several years.
The best way I can describe the 351R is "Quirky" It does so little, but it does it so well. You only have four inputs (OK, 11 if you count HDMI, Analog, and digital separately). But how many do you really need? TV/AUX, Blu-ray, CD, streamer. Boom! the perfect Master Bedroom, unit.
OSD is minimal: think 1980. Room correction? Well sort of. The buttons are minimal: select a source, then select how you want the source processed, The 351R remembers the next time you select that source.
But the sound! Audiophiles like to use all sorts of adjectives to describes components costing thousands of dollars.The essence of those adjectives usually start with nothing--a clean silence upon which all music extends. This receiver gives you that.
There is one problem which must be noted. The HDMI audio delay bug. Apparently this bug effects many higher end stereo components--and there is no excuse. I don't care about HDCP handshake rules and regulation, this drives me mad, and is the only reason why I give this the overall rating of four stars instead of five.
When an audio or video signal begins you loose the first second of audio. This means that if you pause a show on your set top streamer, when you hit play again the video proceeds but it takes the sound about a second to turn off. This is not a lip-sync issue, the sound is simply dropped, so you have to rewind to get the audio.
Likewise playing music, you can loose the first beat of a song. I overcome this by simply playing music through the Analog inputs, but it's very annoying--and it shouldn't exist at all.
But once it starts it's glorious.

With 2.75" woofers and 0.75" tweeters, these Audioengine A2+ A2+B powered desktop speakers enhance sound outputted from your compatible computer or other device, so you can enjoy your media in crisp, powerful sonic detail.


..

37126763 I bought these based on a top review rating from C-Net. I was not able to listen to them in store before buying so I bought based on the review rating. Purchased through BestBuy.com but unit shipped through HIDEF lifestyles which is an amazon like partner that BestBuy evidently works with. Once receiving speakers and listening to the sound for 2 days I decided that this sound was no better than the $50-$60 dollar sets I listed to in person in the store so I contacted HIDEF for an RMA because the sound is not worth $249. First thing I learned was these speakers cant be retuned to best buy but that I need to work with HIDEF. In taking to HIDEF they will not accept any returns if you open the box, so now I am stuck with a pair of speakers that I would have never purchased if I had the opportunity to listen to first. I would have been much happier with a $60 set of speakers and $190 still in my bank account.

This Marantz UD7007 Blu-ray player features 1080p upconversion. To build a complete 3D home theater system, we recommend you purchase a 3D TV, 3D glasses designed for the TV, high-speed HDMI cable and an A/V receiver that is compatible with 3D products.


..

37126763 This is the best blu-Ray player I have ever owned. The 3d crushes the cheap junk from other companies . Although the build quality on the sony 5000es was slightly better it was 800 dollars more did not offer 3d or XLR audio outputs. I feel the mcintosh is better but it is 5500 clams .

Audioengine 2 is the perfect upgrade for your computer, iPod, and all your music.Upgrade your Audio Creating powered multimedia speakers to follow the Audioengine 5 was a challenge, but we feel we've managed to duplicate the signature sound of the Audioengine 5's in a much smaller package perfectly suited for your desktop or a smaller space in your home or office. The Audioengine 2 is a great introduction to high-quality audio and the perfect upgrade for your computer or iPod.


..

6006840520002 i read some great reviews and decided to give 'em a try. was NOT prepared for the audiophile quality sound they produced!
i did get the subwoofer, and enjoy asking people to give 'em a listen with their eyes closed. they can't point to where the speakers are, but can point to the lead guitar, vocalist, drums, etc. the soundstage is THAT accurate.
when they open their eyes and see 6" speakers (again, i do have the sub - S8 @$349.00), they can't believe their ears...or eyes, not sure which!
these speakers are the best buy ever in small, powered speakers, for computer, tv, ipod - plug anything into them and they'll rock!
btw, my home theatre sports deftech spkrs @ $3,000, so i'm kinda used to great sound.
finally, the packaging is first-class. everything comes in a grey cloth bag, double boxed, etc.

..

6006840520002 The a2's are great for desktop use. I purchased these as a nice space conservative set for my laptop as I'd much rather have a good small set than a garbage 5.1. MORE IS NOT BETTER. Listen to the speakers before you buy. A good 2.0/2.1 is a HUGE improvement over buying some Logitech set just because there are more speakers. I like Logitech and all but their speakers always seem lacking.
These speakers have great clarity and depth to them. And they have more than enough bass for the average user. Look pretty snazzy too IMO.
Just remember they're not tilted already so tilt them upward so they're aimed more at your head instead of your chest/belly. Makes a big difference. They sell some overpriced silicon mounts that do the trick but you could probably just prop them up on something else or set them on a higher shelf and work just as well.
I'd recommend them. Obviously

6006840520002 I purchased both the Audioengine 5+ speakers and S8 subwoofer. I wanted to get back to the basics of music listening, two channels (stereo). The main speakers are connected using RCA plugs from an Asus Xnoar Essence STX sound card output to analog audio input on the Audioengine 5+ speakers. My sound card specs indicate output total harmonic distortion plus noise at 1kHz (-3dB) is at 0003% (-110dB) with a SNR of 124dB and a frequency response of 10Hz to 90KHz when listening to 24bit 192 kHz flac files and has an onboard 24bit DAC TI Burr-Brown PCM1792A, it is an excellent match for the speakers. The Audioengine 5+ frequency response is 50Hz  22kHz plus or minus 1.5dB and THD 0.05
I added a nostalgic touch by using a vintage Sansui high efficiency speaker cable connecting the left and right speakers that I purchased in 1981 while deployed to Japan. A lot of music history has passed through that old cable. The S8 subwoofer is connected from the Audioengine 5+ left speakers variable output to the RCA inputs on the S8.
These speakers deserve the opportunity to give you what you paid for, therefore placement is in my opinion is critical. Consider giving them at least 6 feet (if you can) in separation between the speakers and at least 12 inches from back and side walls. My listening area is a small 10 x 10 office I sit between 12 and 36 inches from my desk. The speakers are elevated to a height of 29 inches, toed in and sit upward at 15 degree angle (on Audioengine DS2 Desktop Speaker Stands) placing the 1 silk dome tweeters at ear level. The tweeters on the 5+ are about one inch off center (to the right) so if one was so inclined to switch the placement of the left and right speaker the tweeters would then be inboard to the listener.
I have been experimenting with crossover frequencies between 60Hz to 80Hz. I read that10Hz above the lowest frequency of the main speakers is a general rule of thumb setting and I am still fine tuning however the sweet spot seems to be 80Hz and thats where I have left it. The rear of the S8 is placed three inches from a wall below the left main speaker. In this small room I do not have a lot of options for placement however; I have still managed tweak and peak until I found the sweet spot even with the constraints. By the way, these things sound great at flat response too!
If you are a music lover looking for a stellar 2.0 or 2.1speaker system who will be enjoying your music from a nearfield position and you want a sound that is warm (the perfect term would be euphonic warmth and in my opinion is a selling point) and relatively neutral, yet can crank out your favorite music and still not fatigue your ears, you would be interested in these speakers. These speakers produce decent bass however; if you want a fuller or bigger sound get a subwoofer too. It will really round out the speakers, adding to the wow factor.
My music collection consists primarily of 24bit FLAC and 16bit, 320 kbps mp3 files. Are there instances you can tell the difference between 24bit and 16bit? Yes and no. This is a topic Id rather leave to the hard core audiophiles to debate. However, there is one fact that is constant; trash in, trash out. And there are too many variables to cover in this realm. I have heard 16bit, 44.1Hz, 128kbps mp3s that sound decent and 320kbps mp3s that did not. Some of the 24 bit FLAC files I have listened too are like WOW, a different dimension in sound. These speakers will help you sort the good and bad of your music collection. The speakers are referred to as forgiving butthey dont lie.
I listen to music for 3 hours or more at a time, I have some wonderful, wonderful selections to numerous to list however, my jewels, my favorites to date are Stan Getz and Astrud Gilberto in a 1960s performance of The Girl from Ipanema and seven volumes of Best Audiophile Voices which showcases many female vocalist performing easy listening songs. Close your eyes melt in your chair, and let the world go by kind of relaxation! Simply heaven.
Would I recommend these speakers to family and friends, you bet I would. I cannot put a price tag on the enjoyment I have gotten from these speakers and hope to for many years to come.

..

6006840520002 We have these speakers connected through our airport express using airplay. We can play music from any of our devices anywhere in the house and hear great sound. Evelyn Glennie's beautiful percussion sounds great on these speakers, as does Jazz, Electro, Classical music. And they look nice. Our 25 year old speakers have a little more bass, but these are the favorite speakers in the house.

..

6006840520002 These speakers have wonderful sound quality and build quality! Great highs and great natural bass extension. Very clear sound production. The mids seam a little recessed but not to much to want me asking for more punch from the vocals. They are so wonderfully smooth and warm entering the notes with graceful subtlety. They take some hours for the speakers to really open up. I really recommend a good DAC for accurate sound detail and reproduction.

Audioengine A5+W Speaker System - Glossy White


..

6006840520002 So far I like the product. I am not rating it Excellent because in my opinion it's little costlier and small instrumental sounds gets behind the seen due to high bass.

..

6006840520002 Bought these primarily to take on outings and weekends to use with my iPhone. They were a hit a reunion in the country. Great sound and could equalize the bass to get even better bass response without distortion. However, at home I now use these as my computer speakers, several feet away from my computer, filling the room with sound. Nice flat sound curve.

..

6006840520002 Really my pros and cons say it all. A wonderful sounding speaker system. Crisp clear highs and worm lows, and depending on room and nature of what your using them for a sub is almost not needed. The only thing I don't like is not being able to chose left and right. This only sucks cause my right speaker is near the power outlet so I had to run a small extension cord to the other side of my desk. Really no big deal.
I highly recommend these....

..

6006840520002 THIS COMPANY'S ATTENTION TO DETAIL SHOWS IN EVERYTHING ABOUT IT EVEN THE PACKAGING IT WAS DOUBLE BOXED AND THEN INSIDE WAS REALLY THICK FOAM THAT KEPT THE SPEAKERS SUSPENDED FROM ANY DAMAGE NOT THAT CHEEP STYROFOAM OR CARDBOARD MATERIAL SPEAKERS ARE USUALLY PACKAGED WITH. THEN WRAPPED IN A CLOTH BAG ALSO USED TO CLEAN THE SPEAKERS AND FOR STORAGE,
THEN THERE IS THE SOUND. I KNEW THAT THESE THINGS HAVE A BURN IN PERIOD OF 30-50HRS. OF USE BEFORE THEY OPEN UP. BUT MAN JUST THE FIRST FEW MINUTES OF LISTENING TO THESE THINGS AND MY JAW DROPPED AND AFTER BURN IN PERIOD THEY SOUND SO MUCH BETTER. MY M-AUDIO BX5A STUDIO MONITORS DO NOT EVEN COMPETE WITH THESE SPEAKERS THE SOUND OUT OF IT IS SO MUCH MORE CLEANER AND SMOOTHER AND THEY ARE ABOUT THE SAME SIZE, WATTAGE AND DESIGN.
I HAD ALSO ORDERED THE D1 DAC SINCE IT WAS 50% OFF AT THE TIME WITH THE PURCHASE OF THE SPEAKERS AND THE DS2 STANDS. AFTER I HAD PUT THE SPEAKERS ON THE DS2 STANDS AND HOOKED UP THE D1 DAC I WAS IN HEAVEN I DID NOT THINK THE SOUND COULD GET ANY BETTER BUT IT DID. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS LIKE I DID TRYING OUT DIFFERENT DESK TOP SPEAKERS, MINI HIFI SYSTEMS, AND SOUND DOCKS JUST GIVE THESE A TRY I AM GLAD I DID ITS WORTH EVERY CENT AND MORE.

6006840520002 
Audioengine A5+B Speaker System - Satin Black


..

6006840520002 They are a great speaker especially when mated with the subwoofer.

..

6006840520002 Got the A5+ in black in a deal - have them for almost an year and they sound really great. The speakers have excellent build quality and can take quite a bit of abuse. I paired them with the TV and use them for movies and games - so far, I have no complains and I dont miss a full fledged home theater set up. They pack quite a punch - however, the bass could be improved using a sub-woofer. This does not bother me a lot , but could be a deal breaker for some. Only downside I see is that the set is quite heavy. Those who prefer more lightweight set would be served by A2 speakers.

..

6006840520002 Excellent PC speakers. Great sound. Clarity and bass

..

6006840520002 A speaker well worth the 400 asking price. What they consider a bookshelf or multimedia (computer) speaker doesn't do justice for these. There are sounds coming from them that my dogs will tilt their head wondering where the sound came from. The dogs now watch TV because of the sound produced from them. I originally bought them for work and quickly realized how good they were. I currently have them connected to a 50 watt powered sub and to my 55" TV. I believe the sound will rival some 5.1 systems in power, and they do sound cleaner than most others. Highly recommend these speakers for anything and do yourself a favor and research them.... I did and the reviews were 100% correct.

..

6006840520002 The sound from these speakers is astounding ( and I have nothing to do with the company). I had Klipsch speakers (very good) and Bose Companion 5's (good)...these speakers blew both of them away. I hear things in songs I never heard before. They are big, but wow, the sound!!!

..

6006840520002 The Audioengine 5+, with the new integrated heat sync on the back of the power-up speaker - fixing the heat management problem from the prior version, the 5, is a 5 star set of powered desktop monitor/speaker that delivers wonderful sound - audiophile-level!
They are not light, and they are each about the size of an industrial lunch-box, but even at very low volume, what wonderful sound - across the full range and a great price.
If you want excellent speakers and never want to think about them again, get these.

Listen to tunes on the go with these Able Planet True Fidelity BT400B Bluetooth wireless headphones that utilize LINX AUDIO technology for optimal sound quality and speech clarity. The on-ear volume control lets you easily adjust the audio level.


..

38832582 A very good value for the money. They Get loud enough to use in crowded areas. Sound quality is the same as more expensive phones. The only downside is that the recharge outlet isn't a micro USB, so if you lose the cable, you're SOL.

..

38832582 Great for yard work. Great sound and volume. Would recommend.

..

38832582 Bought these for around the house use, but ended up using them more at work. I work around machines, and these help by reducing noise around me.

..

38832582 Headsets provide good sound quality and are very comfortable. I use them when I walk or workout so I like the design on the headset. Bluetooth connection appears to be reliable and connects quickly.

..

38832582 Great Sound.
adjustable HEADBAND WOULD MAKE IT PERFECT.

..

38832582 I have been looking a long time for affordable Bluetooth headphones and these were perfect. Great sound and quality in a convenient travel size - folds small - no more wires!

..

38832582 Just purchased this as a gift for my teenage son. What a great headset for the cost. The set up was extremely easy,and my son loves the sound. Have not found many flaws in teh short time that he has been using it.. He is still learning the full range in the house before the signal fades.

..

38832582 I got this pair after going through 3 pairs of Motorola S305s (pure garbage) in a month. I like over the ear headphones for cold winter jogs. These are comfortable and sound good overall. My only complaint is that at low volume there is a hiss/hum that is more noticeable than on previous bluetooth headphones.

..

38832582 I have owned these for over a month now, I love them!
I am getting over 40 ft of range, and the battery has lasted me up to 12 hours without dying. I am sure these would last at least 15 hours at full volume! It took me about 2 hours to recharge after using them for those 12 hours. So not to bad.
This device paired right up with my tablet (Hisense Sero 7 Pro) and the controls on the headset work great. Next and last tracks, volume and play/pause controls.
I really have no complaints, the sound is very good, although the bass is a bit weak because the ear pieces do not fit real tight against the ear. But if you press on them to make a tighter fit, the bass sounds good.
Over all this is a great device, the best I have found for under a $100. You won't be sorry if you get them.

View the night sky clearly with this telescope that features a motorized Altazimuth mount and fully computerized hand control and NexStar Star Observer List software that lets you control the telescope via laptop or PC.


..

38832582 I purchased the Celestron 102SLT expecting quality (particularly given the stellar reviews online). I received my telescope promptly from Best Buy. But upon opening up the package in a dimly lit room, I noticed the objective lens appeared to be covered in dust and dirt. Not to be swayed, I hosed the area down with some compressed air, but the debris didnt budge. I ran a lens cloth through and yep, all of it was INSIDE. I called a very helpful Best Buy customer service and was quickly mailed a replacement. Unfortunately, the replacement had even larger debris and even looked partially used, given all the scrapes on the tube. I informed both Best Buy and Celestron on the issue concerning this particular refractor. After three weeks of getting the runaround with Celestron, their solution, All our astronomical scopes have a two-year warranty. This would cover foreign particles inside optical components like refractor objectives. Expect to buy brand new Celestron products and immediately ship it back for a proper cleaning.
Note: Do not clean the telescope yourself, as this action will void the warranty.

This economical seven-piece accessory kit enhances the performance of your Celestron PowerSeeker, or most any other telescope. Includes two full-size 1.25" eyepieces, three eyepiece filters, a cleaning cloth, and a case. One medium power & one high power eyepiece give you a new perspective on celestial objects. A Moon filter helps block out some moonlight so you can see more lunar detail, and the two color filters (Red & Blue) highlight features on Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. A hard plastic carry case keeps everything safe in the foam-lined interior.


..

38832582 We're starting as amateur astronomers, me and my 6-year old son. These lenses give us spectacular views of the moon, stars and the planets. Awesome!!

..

38832582 this filter set makes stargazing much easier. it knocks down the brightness of the moon so you can see more details in the surface.

..

38832582 Seeing the moon in a different view is a great experience. I am new to using a telescope and this is a wonderful addition. It was a bit overcast where I'm at but was able to still see Jupiter, no spot but did see 2 shadows of the moons crossing Jupiter - what a thrill - great addition and a must have!

Celestron 47007 Weather Station - 100 ft - Wall Mountable, Desktop


..

38832582 No problem with installation. Setup is easy with a very large display

..

38832582 The main reason I purchased the weather station was for the visibility to see the reading from across the room. Purchased for my 80 yr old Mom. Besides that, the readings were way off. The indoor and outdoor readings were always the same. I could never figure out how to change the channel for my areas climate. Unfortunately, I had to return product.

Enjoy a clear view in harsh weather conditions with these Celestron Cavalry 71424 binoculars that feature waterproof and fog-proof construction for reliable protection from the elements. The 50mm objective lenses enable use in dimly lit areas.


..

38832582 Only reason I mentioned smaller in size was because when kayaking or traveling, you what to keep equipment light. For wife purposes, smaller would be more user friendly. But in any case, money well spent. I would have spent more in order to appease above. I had the best binos during Alaskan whale watching quest.

..

38832582 These are a powerful and great pair of binoculars. I easily was able to see Saturn's moon Titan in a very light-polluted sky! The binoculars are easy to handle, aren't heavy, are weatherproof, and seem well built (with a protective rubber housing). I wasn't fatigued after about 30 min. of viewing without using a tripod. They are the perfect intro level binos for astronomy (they can be connected to a tripod, although the adaptor is NOT included -- one option is the Barska adapter). Add this to the price and Best Buy's quick shipping....what's not to like!!

Crosley turntables and entertainment centers look good just about anywhere, but they look great on the Crosley Bardstown Entertainment Cabinet. The Entertainment Cabinet is charming in its classic Crosley style and provides plenty of storage. Constructed of handcrafted hardwoods and veneers, the Entertainment Cabinet is featured in a classic finish. Complete with a wooden shelf for storing your CDs and cassettes and a decorative glass door for storing your precious and rare vinyl.


..

38832582 This item adequately provided need for a smaller TV in my exercise room. It has style and provided storage space in the cabinet to maintain a clean look. It also was a little higher than alot of TV stands which gives me a reasonable sight line while using exercise equipment. Only downside was the instructions for assembly which were not entirely clear.

..

38832582 Overall this is a good looking entertaining unit that comes with good quality parts. Assembly procedure is easy to follow and built, except the last step of attaching the door to the unit. The predrill screw holes don't align between the upper and lower hinges. Each verticle hinge requires three small screws and could easily stripped. Since the screw holes don't align, I had to drill new holes for the screws to fit. In the process of putting screws to the hinge, I stripped 2 screws, and I had to buy replacement screws at a hardware store. Overall the unit looks great and the price is good.

..

38832582 Assembly was easy and took less than 15 minutes, start to finish.

..

38832582 This piece looks okay enough - but 2 big problems with it. The back does not have any openings, so if you want to have a DVD player or cable box with wires coming out of the back, you would have to leave the entire back off or make your own openings. More troubling, the door - which was very challenging to put on - will not stay closed - it keeps swinging open even when I put a shim under the front 2 legs to tilt it up.

..

38832582 I had a big screen tv mounted on the wall and needed something small to hold DVR and other small electronics. This is the perfect size.

..

38832582 I origianlly bought this piece as something to store my vinyl records in-because I liked the way it looked. After I got it home I realized this could be used as a night stand also. Pretty awesome! The black looks great with my bedroom furniture. So glad I decided to go with this!

..

38832582 Bought this piece to put under a flat screen wall mount to hold a DVD player and cable box. It serves the purpose very well - without sticking out too far into the room.

Enjoy your favorite tunes alone or with friends using these Flips Audio 06-0990R over-the-ear headphones that feature solo mode for private listening and social mode for simple conversion to stereo speakers.


..

38832582 I really like the headset bought them for group work out. In the gym you can use them as regular headset. Would recommend .

..

38832582 My son wanted the beets pro I didn't think they were quite worth the money. We decided to try these & love them.

..

38832582 Serious sound buffs likely would not be impressed with quality of the speakers, but for me they are perfect. I love audio books on my IPhone while driving, hate ear buds, sometimes want passengers to be able to listen too, and drive a '98 vehicle which will not accept any means I've been able to find to boost the IPhone volume for listening while driving. My Flips have solved this problem! but some might want even more volume than these offer. Speaker battery lasted about 6 hours before needing a charge, works for me as I rarely drive longer than that any way. I now also take my Flips on long flights because it is way more sanitary, OK and fun, to have your own head phones and I think the carry case is too cute!

Bring high-quality lights and sound to the party with this Ion Audio House Party IPA18D speaker system, which features Bluetooth technology for simple wireless pairing with compatible devices and light projection capability to add to the fun.


..

38832582 This is a pretty adequate machine for the price. No major issues. Easy to use.

..

38832582 This is a very cool speaker with ok sound. Where it lacks in sound quality, it makes up with the party light ball! I was amazed with the lights. Much better than I expected! If this was only the disco lights, it would be awesome....but the Bluetooth speaker makes it perfect! My 15 year old was extremely pleased!

..

38832582 Lower the lights, plug this in, pair your iPhone... and you have an insta-party. Incredibly light and so easy to use. I would definitely recommend this product.

..

38832582 We saw a much larger one of these for over double the price in another popular store. When I saw this one, I checked all the specs and it looked very similar. I knew Best Buy had a great return policy so figured I would try it for such a huge savings on money. Well, it WONT be returned!. My teenager said this was the best present ever and has not stopped using it whether by herself or with friends. All of her classmates want one. This size is perfect for any reasonably sized house party. It plays to the beat of the music when you have it hooked up with your iphone. We haven't tried the Karaoke jack yet, but even without it, this is an amazing gift.

..

38832582 very easy to use and very accurate, simple setup and simple use

..

38832582 tried it several times and it cannot be correct
last try I was at a golf outing and drank rum all day and was feeling it and blew .01

..

38832582 I wanted to know my status when I go to happy hour. How many can I have in what period of time? I learned my safe and enjoyable level of intake, and now can relax knowing I am well within legal limits when I drive. Interesting to learn how long it takes to clear your BAC the morning after a party... taught my friends that just because it is morning does NOT mean you are OK to drive.

..

38832582 I highly recommend this device. It is very accurate, which is the purpose for this item.

..

38832582 good product for the price. easy to use. seem really acurate

..

38832582 I've had this product for several months. According to the built in counter it has been used more than 80 times now. While more expensive than a lot of other devices, this one has been worth the money. It seems to test very accurately and consistently. I've taken it to a few parties where several people want to test themselves throughout the night. The relative results have always been as expected. We even throw in a few sober people in the middle and they always test 0.00. Many cheaper devices can test above 0.00 when no alcohol has been consumed. If you depend on the accuracy of the device, I wouldn't risk it on a lower quality product.
Having removable mouth piece allows testing multiple people easily and they can be clean for reuse; although the more people drink the less they care about sharing.
I also bought additional mount pieces for pretty low cost. The device does come with extras, but I figure drinking will lead to them being misplaced or being carried off by someone.

..

38832582 This breathalyzer worked great, is easy to use, and seemed to be very accurate.

..

38832582 Nice little device to have at party or when out with friends. Some may seem the number is low or high but that depends on persons alcohol tolerance. Some feel bad at .15 others may barely feel it. Be sure to wait 15 mins or so after any drink or food to get best results. If you don't, the results will vary and not be accurate. Easy to use by just blowing till it beeps and wait for the results.

..

38832582 I have been using the Bactrack S75 since September 2010. I have been very impressed with all aspects of the product.
First, accuracy. What's the point of having a breathalyzer if it's not accurate. I have owed a personal breathalyzer before, a $49 model, and this Bactrack is 10 times better. This model is consistent test to test, so if I test someone 3 times in a row I get the same test result each test. Sometimes I'm surprised when I get a positive result hours after I stop drinking, but if I count through all the drinks, the result makes perfect sense. The sheer consistency of the results makes me trust the accuracy of this product.
The mouthpieces are easy to use and reuse. I only change a mouthpiece when testing a different person.
The size and shape are booth good. It's not as small as an iphone or blackberry, but it's small enough to take with you whenever you're drinking.
I'm not sure why everyone doesn't have one of these. Cops are all over with DUI checks, so this is money well spent. This product is highly recommended.

This weather station displays indoor and outdoor temperatures with minimum and maximum readings. The 915MHz instant transmission provides up to a 20' wireless range for flexible placement options.


..

38832582 After alot of effort nothing we could do would keep the unit running. I will be returning it. Also it is larger than I expected.

..

38832582 Seems to work well, no problems. Nice looking unit and easy to setup.

La Crosse Technology WS-8115U-B Atomic Digital Wall Clock


..

38832582 Bought this item to replace some older Oregon Scientific units......so far, they are working well and are very accurate.......and I have OCD regarding correct temp/time readings. ;-)

..

38832582 Use it's atomic clock to reset everything after power outages. Check outdoor temperatures often.

..

38832582 Love this product! Fairly easy to set up. Unfortunately, not all of the items I purchased worked. I was so enamoured with the first clock/temperature gauge I bought that I bought several more! Some could not be set up properly and did not work properly. Too bad for me! I love the product, but only the ones that work. I bought the extra items to give them away to friends.

..

38832582 Gave the wall clock to my daughter and she loves it. Setup is easy and quickly received the correct time. The outside temperature sensor works very well.

..

38832582 This does what it is supposed to. Works off the atomic clock so it set itself and time is always accurate. It uses an outdoor sensor to show the temperature. The font and size are good for seeing at a distance. An optional backlight would have been a nice feature. Overall, this was a very good buy.

..

38832582 Worked nice out of the box. No set up problems and very nice features.

..

38832582 Well I think the clock is awsome if it works.
I received mine in the mail and the external temperature sensor seemed to be defective. When I inserted batteries, one battery kept wanting to pop out. Even though snap the cover on you can hear the battery dislodge from the sensor. One thing I didn't like is there was no light or indicator on the sensor that it was getting power from the battery.
I am going to order another and give this one last try.
Here are the Good things about it that I like...
- Large numbers easy to read
- Nice Shiny black boarder look nice
- Setup may be challenging to some non technical folks, but instructions are pretty easy to follow. Important to read carefully to setup properly.
- Time, and date updates automatically
Nice to not have to worry about setting it all the time.

38832582 This device perfectly fits a real need that I have and it does it well at a very fair price. Because of one badly damaged/disabled leg, most exercise methods are closed to me because they are all so leg-oriented. This device has a good weight, balance and design that allows me to get some upper body and cardio work-out easily while I watch TV. You can also pedal it using your legs if desired. It stores away easily which is important in my small home. The resistance adjustment is a wheel that provides some type of friction variance that is just ok; but I really didn't expect a fancy magnetic device at this price. I've only had it a month or so but it's doing just great so far and I'd buy it again.

38832582 My co-worker and I sit 8-10 hours a day & our job feeds us all the time.
We are sick of it! We try to work out after work but mentally exhausted. I saw this on here (which i didnt know bb sold this) showed my co-worker and we split it.
We're here now at work and so far, I've been sitting here for a half an hour and 200 calories burned!!!!!!!!!!!! Though I'm sweating a little, our job doesn't require seeing a customer or corporate, its awesome!!
Wish we did this so long ago! I would've been 30 lbs lighter!
I TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS!!!! SO QUIET!

Give your sound a vintage edge with this Crybaby Classic GCB95F wah pedal, which is compatible with most electric instruments and features a Fasel inductor for stunning tones with rich harmonics and expansive vocal sweep.


..

6006840070007 This pedal is very good with specific guitars and amplifier set ups. It sounds especially nice on the clean channel. Some people argue that there is a high pitched hiss over the amplifier when turned up. That being true, it isn't that disturbing to me. I gave it a $ for sound quality because I feel that the lows are too low and the mids aren't as prominent as they should be. However, it is a very satisfying wah wah and I highly approve of it.

..

6006840070007 This is a very good wah. It's the classic. Very strong trebles that cut through nicely. I recomend this pedal.

..

6006840070007 Well, pretty close to the origional. Wah(analog) pedals have changed very little over the years and are an essential in Rock, Blues, Funk, Metal, and other types of music.
I have had one of these Crybabies for over 15 years and it works as good as it did brand new. Belive me, it has been thru hell too. I had long lost the screws that hold the bottom plate and it was held on with duct tape for about 12 years until i recently found replacement screws and feet.
When the time comes to add a wah to your collection. this is the one to get!

..

6006840070007 This is the first analog delay I have ever used & it is quite a bit different than a digital delay. The sound id a little darker and not quite as precise, but in a good sort of way. I tried to open this up to adjust the internal trim pots but they are very small so I did not mess with them. I got a great deal on this pedal & would recommend it to anyone looking for an entry level analog delay.

The Dunlop DB-01 Dime Crybaby Wah. FREE shipping anywhere in the USA! Quite possibly the most tonally diverse wah on the planet! This might just be the most flexible, powerful wah pedal ever. Designed in conjunction with Dimebag Darrell of Pantera, the DB-01 Crybaby From Hell gives you everything you need to do serious wah damage. It's basically what I'd call a hot-rodded wah, Dimebag explains. It's pretty tricked outit's got an extended sweep so you can get it to go more high-endy sounding and deeper too. There's a 5-way selector on the side so you can pick what frequency you're gonna play within. You've got a kick-in boost and LED indicators [Wah on/off, Boost on/off] at the back of the pedalinstead of at the frontso you can see them from the back of the stage. And it's got skateboard skid-tape on it instead of rubber so when you've got beer on your feet you won't slip off it. One other little trick is an extra input jack on the left-hand side of the pedal so you can go in and out of the CFH on just that side if you want. That way, if you're just using the wah, you don't have to loop a chord around the top of the thing, so it's less likely to get stuck under the pedal. I'm real proud of the CFH, man, Dime concludes. It sounds bad-assed and it looks bad-assed too. It's ready for war!   - Power: Single 9 volt battery or Dunlop ECB-003 AC Adapter- Controls: Adjustable "Q" control modulates frequency breadth of effect  - Adjustable Volume Boost knob from 0 to + 17dB - Volume Boost On/Off switch, mounted on side (red LED indicates on Fine Tune knob adjusts the toe down sweep range - Six-position knob selects frequency center of effect, mounted on side Wah LED indicates Wah effect on Two-position switch for second output jack function selection (located on main circuit board inside pedal.


..

6006840070007 This pedal is awesome, it has 5 settings and 3 smaller knobs to control the tone of the wah, There is such a great range of tones for the wah. This pedal is super tough, especially for gigs. Great for solos and metal.

6006840070007 I am a 25 year playing and 20 year gigging semi pro muscian. i have had just about every processor from the past 20 yaers or so, and finally went to pedals. The problem is they are noisy and unreliable. I won a gift card and got this bad boy, and am TOTALLY satisfied. i use it mostly for modulation and delays. i kept my compression, wah, and overdrive in front of the unit, and use the on board global noise gate to clean things up. GREAT INVESTMENT!

..

6006840070007 This box is really the first of it's kind available. Every effects pedal Line 6 offers is integrated into this one board. The effects can then be used individually, or placed into "Scenes", which are saved combinations. If you play live, this is a dream come true. One button switches all of your effects, so you can set up your whole show on a menu controlled with one button.
There's also a built in tuner, a looper with 30 seconds of loop record time, and jacks to change the order of your effects, for stereo playing, and even MIDI support.
The effects all sound fantastic, and even feature true bypass. You can even turn gating on/off on distortion effects- something not normally seen on multi-pedals.
The case is all metal, with overbars to protect the knobs. Colored displays make it easy to recognize effect groups (especially in the dark).
My one complaint is they should have made the knobs "infinite" knobs. They're fixed position knobs, which can be a bit clumsy to fiddle with when making adjustments.
Keep an eye on the M13- you're going to be seeing a lot of musicians adding it to their rigs.

Splits HDMI signal to 2 HDMI displays completely, has the ability of buffering and amplifying. Fully HDMI 1.3 specification compliant. It is applicable to source device and high definition display device such as DVD and HDTV which have HDMI ports or digital ports and are compliant with HDCP protocol.


..

34463199 I bought this splitter to have my DirecTV HR22-100 DVR box output feed both the XBOX One HDMI input and one of my Pioneer Elite VSX01-TXH A/V receiver HDMI inputs. While my wife and I can use the XBOX One to watch TV (using voice commands and interactive OneGuide) through the XBOX One HDMI output to another AV receiver HDMI input- others (i.e. our parents and elderly dog sitter) aren't quite ready to switch from the old model of watching TV. So when they are around I can just switch to the DirecTV HDMI leg on the AV receiver through the splitter.
I received the splitter yesterday and within 2 minutes had it hooked up and working with 1080i video and DTS 5.1 audio and through both splitter output sources. So I am very pleased. The cost was very reasonable as well (compared to other splitters I found on the web# and it arrived even faster than I expected.
Only 2 downsides.
- The LED indicator lights are red. I prefer green. Just a personal preference. I still like the fact that there are indicators to tell you which connections are active.
- The time to get to a new channel on a change is a little longer #to be expected because of HDCP key negotiation and through the splitter). Most of our TV watching is on recorded shows and we're not big channel surfers so this is a very minor issue for us.

34463199 This is my first dash camera and I feel that it could be better. It has a owners manual and the print is small and not very helpful. Only films in 480 and doesn't show video outside of program. Would like to be able to see the video bigger and where you can save it in your video section. The plus is the gps and that when you view the video through the program you can see where you traveled but only displays speed in km/h while recording. It could also have it where you could charge the camera from an wall outlet only charges from the car. This process takes 4 hours and is no good if your not driving less then 4 hours so you have to have the power supply plugged in all the time. Short Battery life.

Agptek iP17S-A Smartphone Case - Smartphone - White


..

34463199 I believe that the warehouse had sent me a faulty or a USED battery case because when I received the case the package it came in was cracked on both sides and the sticker had already been peeled off on the sides. On top of that a piece from the top part had came out. I tried it out just to see if it works. It charges my phone for a good 3 minutes then it dies. So i place the case back on the charger and the light show that its been full charged, and I tried charging my phone with it again, and again it dies after 3 minutes. This was very disappointing and I would not recommend anyone to get this product.

This product appears to be new and is in good condition. I'm enjoying the fact that I don't have to shuffle around games, when I decide to play something different.

..

34463199 Do not buy this item! First off they say it is new that is not the case. The company that sells it is hard to reach and best buy cannot help you with a return. I looked it up on the internet and this third party product can get you banned on Xbox live.

..

34463199 I bought this to update my Xbox 360. It is a great HDD Hard Disk Drive, easy to install and very stable. Now I can enjoy my video games.

..

34463199 Excellent item for the money. Xbox recognized it without any issues.

..

34463199 The hard drive was exactly what I was looking for. Simple plug and play is perfect for me

..

34463199 Great value for the capacity, and a quick easy install just plug and play.

..

34463199 Made my sons xbox worth having I didn't realize the one I purchased in the bundle waUs only 4 for $250.00.

..

34463199 My Xbox recognized it right away! Works perfect! Perfect for the Xbox slim!

..

34463199 Pretty simple, we plugged it in and my son has not complained at all.

..

34463199 I thought I would buy this hard drive from a non-Microsoft brand company to save some money. Totally regret that decision as this hard drive does not work at all. The Xbox wont even recognize that it is plugged in. Installation of these in the Xbox Slim is pretty easy so I know its not user error. The Drive just doesn't work. Now I have to wade through customer service to see if I can get a refund... what a waste of time.

..

34463199 I've had this product only for a day now, i stuck the hd in my xbox (it reconized it) then downloaded halo reach maps, then downloaded all the Bf3 maps. prolly deserves 5 stars but I haven't tested the product out that much yet.

..

34463199 This product does not work properly. Once inserted, it slows the xbox down to a crawl. It will not even load a game. Called xbox/microsoft and they told me this is a defective product and a possible knock off. The Model number is different on the product than the one on the purchase order. I ordered a Agtek and no where on this product or box does it say that name . Mambate does not have a customer service. They have a message machine that is FULL and you cannot leave a message. Sent several emails and have no response. Best Buy told me I bought this product from Mambate and their recourse is to refer you back to Mambate. This was my sons birthday gift and he can't use it. Not only is that a HUGE disappointment but the lack of customer service from MAMBATE and Best Buy to help resolve this issue has been impossible.

34463199 This product does not work properly. Once inserted it slows the xbox down to a crawl. It would not even let a game load. Called xbox/microsoft and they told me this is a defective product and I should send it back. Mambate does not have customer service. They have a message machine that is FULL and you cannot leave a message. This is a huge disappointment because this was my sons birthday gift and he can't use it. And I have no Idea how long it will take to get a refund or a product that works since Mambate does not have a good phone numbmer.

..

34463199 I ordered this product and was expecting it with in a few days. 2 days later got an email saying it could not ship for a week. so i have waited for this product for over 2 weeks. i get it today, the product is OBVIOUSLY used! ! it has scratches all over it and even the internal part that connects to the xbox is scratched up !
When i put it in my XBOX it automatically FREEZES the whole system. i have gave it time thinking maybe it takes a lil bit, nope ! it is completely horrible and does not let you even get to your home screen.
i then called the company and they said i could send it back and they will send me another but it will be aprox. 2 weeks. this is horrible customer service and i expected WAY more from a company that is on Best Buy's website !!

..

34463199 Now, this is the first product I have ever had a product that was defective. I received this product yesterday, popped it into my XBOX 360 Elite system, downloaded the Dashboard, downloaded ALL of the XBOX Live updates. I transferred my files from my old 120GB HDD to my new 250GB HDD from Mambate. This process was relatively easy with the Data transfer cable that I purchased from Best Buy. Upon finishing, I was required to download my profile again, etc.. This is fine, and what I expected.
What really blew my mind is that after downloading ALL of the of the XBOX Live updates, and dashboard I was constantly being thrown an error message advising upon booting up (it was missing files for the Dashboard, and needs to reboot). When I was able get logged in everything was missing, and I was unable to use any apps (I use Netflix alot...) soI reformatted and tried again. Same issue.
One other thing that bothered me were cosmetics for the 250GB HDD from Mambate... When checking the slot where the Xbox 360 connects to the HDD I noticed that the 250GB HDD was extremely loose, whereas my Xbox 120GB HDD was not very loose. Also when it was running for the little bit of time besides redownloading everything it was humming EXTREMELY loud... Louder than my PC (tower with 4 fans) I seriously thought it was going to explode after a minute or so of listening to it spin.
At this time I have already contacted MAMBATE for a return label. If you do not have XBOX Live I could see this working for you. (Third Party and all). I was hoping for better quality product, in this case defective.

..

34463199 I guess someone gets a lemon and that was me. The hard drive took over 2 weeks to ship. The product packaging was damaged (shipping packaging was fine). Hard drive itself was poorly made.Rattled when shaken slightly. Nothing when inserted in Xbox. Like plugging in an empty piece of plastic. Sent back to this 3rd party vendor (my cost) after 1st phone call and, after 2 more calls and 4 weeks got refund.

..

34463199 This was half the price as the Microsoft one and has worked just a good. There is really nothing bad I can say about it.

..

34463199 very easy to install, very good in price, great for the XBox360

..

34463199 Good for download map packs like COD games if you only have 4gb Xbox 360.

..

34463199 I t worked fine for like 3 days then all of a sudden it said i needed to format the drive and i lost everything i had saved on it im very un happy

..

34463199 Great Hard drive for the xbox360 lots of memory for a wonderful price. A little difficult to figure out backward compatibility but once i got it, it works great! I would certainly recommend this to a friend of mine for purchase!

..

34463199 I dont play online but have downloaded updates and dlc and have had no problems with getting kicked off xbox live. It even says microsoft on my storage device screen by the drive. lots of memory to fill now.

..

34463199 The online version of best buy helps a lot and i love it.

The Watch Walkie Talkie is the newest generation in personal two-way communications. It's a lightweight, compact two-way communication device that can be used to stay connected with family of friends at parks, shopping mails, sporting events, concerts-virtually any indoor or out door activity.


..

34463199 I bought these so my son can play outside and still stay in touch without me yelling for him to come in the house. These worked a little better than some others I've used: less static, easy to hear each other, easy for his little fingers to press the buttons, pretty decent range. BUT within 24 the LCD screen on one was only halfway working, maybe 50% of the screen was visible. I will likely return or exchange. If a second set goes the same route then I will likely get a refund and try another model. Disappointing.

No need to spend a lot either, as all HDMI switches work on the same technologyNOTE: Without AC Adapter or Power Cord Included, for this device is powered by HDMI cable directly!


..

34463199 I have a cable box and a Blue ray player in one room and a x box and dvd recorder/receiver in another room. so after awhile I thought I'll bring them to one room so I bought this switch box back in January of 13 but just brought it all together 3 weeks ago, so now I can now control the switch for all of them from my chair because it automaticly changes it to the source I want be just turning the source on. It comes with a remote but I don't use it due the source switching for me. I see a lot of comments saying the A/C plug doesn't come with it but mine did but remember I got mine in Jan 2013 but don't need it because it gets it 's power from the source I turn on so they probably removed the plug, so again I have everything plugged into one box and loving it

..

34463199 DO NOT BUY THIS!!! I should have checked the reviews on the product. As with everyone else, the unit does not come with the charger and is completely useless without it. Who sells stuff like this? It is not sold by Best Buy and you can not return it with them! Mambate is the seller and I may or may not be able to return the product because I opened it. Plus, even if I can return the switcher, I will most likely have to pay for the return myself which will be close to the cost of the unit to begin with. BUYER BEWARE

..

34463199 Ordered from the Best Buy Marketplace. Received the product without a power cord and without a user manual.

..

34463199 I bought this item on the Best Buy Market Place thinking I was getting it from Best Buy but it ended up being from a 3rd party vender. Im sure the product would have been great but unfortunately it did not include the power cord which they did not mention in the Market Place add.I have never bought an electric item that did not come with the power cord and when I called them they didn't offer to send one they said i need to go buy one. So apperently the inforemation that some of the companies put in thier adds are incomplete or just misleading. I would suggest calling the companies to make sure the items are complete or you will have to make a trip to an electronic store, and what would be point of buying online .

Works perfect.

..

34463199 With some hardware, like my TV adapter, it doesn't work well enough to be able to use it, also the same with my 1TB external hard drive. It works okay with the adapter for my mouse and keyboard, but any hardware that consumes a lot of power doesn't function. I would return it but it serves the purpose by giving me more ports and I can use it for the low power items. Won't ever buy one like this again, and will be looking soon for a better one.

34463199 I bought about a month ago and it already doesn't work.

34463199 I bought this acouple days ago and it took me about an hour to install (didnt know what i was doing.) the quality on the monitor is what you would expect but it works fine for me. its nothing too fancy but for a simple normal person it will work pretty good.

NOTE: Without AC Adapter or Power Cord included, for this device is powered by HDMI cable directly!


..

34463199 I was not able to use this product until forking out another $30 for a dc power supply. You definitely lose picture quality when going through the adapter.

..

34463199 Device functions and is a great bargain for the price. Though not having a power supply was confusing at first I quickly realized that it runs off of the HDMI devices connected too it. The whole thing is very small and the fact that it doesn't take up a spot on my power strip is great. Only complaint is my TV remote occasionally activates the switch when I am adjusting the volume but it is an infrequent occurrence.

..

34463199 I bought this to connect multiple devices to my surround sound system. It came without a DC adapter to power the box. When I contacted the company they said it works without the DC adapter the HDMI cables will provide power. This is not true I've hooked it up and it won't work at all. The remote is worthless as well you have to use the buttons on the top to switch through the 3 devices, keep in mind none of the 3 devices will work. Now I'm stuck with it because I believed it would work without the power supply and didn't get around to trying it out until i'm past the return time frame and through away the box. Completely useless!

..

34463199 Bought this piece of junk through the marketplace, now I will have to go through who knows what to get it replaced or refunded. I will never buy through this service again. Very disappointed in Best Buy, a company I have been shopping with for decades. Maybe Best Buy should review the companies it does business with.

34463199 I've had Lenovo batteries die on me twice over the past few years, usually right after the 2 year mark of owning one. It's really the only piece of hardware they are not good at, and I was fed up with spending $170+ to replace it. This third-party battery is incredibly cheap, and after about a month of use, seems to be almost as good as the Lenovo replacement. The battery I received was manufactured just a month before I received it, so don't worry about getting old stock. I'm not getting the 5 hours of life I was getting on my original 9-cell battery, but it's in the ballpark (3.5-4 hours), and the drop is probably mostly because I'm running at lot more stuff on my laptop (T-400) than I was 2 years ago. Also, it has nice packaging.

34463199 I received the battery about a week ago, fully charged the battery and brought my laptop on the road with me. I was wondering why it was dead by the time I got to my destination seeing that it was off the whole time. I plugged it up again and it got really hot. The bar said it was 100% charged so I unplugged it. 5 minutes later I was told it was at 17% and to plug it back up. I e-mailed the company and I am waiting on a response.

34463199 I bought this 5 months ago. It stopped charging. I called best buy. They told me I would have to contact Apple about this battery. I did. They told me I would have to go to an Apple Store. Apple told me its not an Apple battery so its Best Buys problem. The Apple store is over an hour away from me and a lot of gas. So I call best buy and explain. Get put on hold. Get cut off. I call back. Get put on hold. Get cut off after explaining numerous times again and again about what is going on. FINALLY after getting to the escalation dept because I am not happy at this point I am told that I can contact the manufacturer. The number they half have is international. NEVER buy a none apple battery. Price does not matter! I am eating this battery and if Im lucky will get a $20.00 BB coupon for my trouble.

..

34463199 I searched for the best price and reputation to buy this after market MacBook Pro battery, I have the large 17 inch and had the original battery for 4-5 years, I do not use the laptop much and always on a charger, not the battery so it lasted long for me... but while preparing for my month trip to Asia I found out the original battery expanded and split its seams. I searched the whole web and found some companies I never heard of... I was shocked that Best had basically the best price and with free shipping and no sales tax as I am in Florida... took a chance on delivery as I need to leave in a week for Asia... I was delighted to get the battery in about 3 working days... opened it and worked perfect, been using it a month now and very delighted so far with its quality and overall purchasing.... Best did their homework to work with this company that sent me the battery, I felt safer buying from a name brand company like Best then just sending to someone in California that barely spoke english....

..

34463199 Really impressed with this. I had a few BB gift certificates to burn and bought 2 of these Bluetooth sets. One each for me and my husband. We are using it with our iPhones
It's VERY lightweight. Does seem to be cheap material but I'm guessing that's to keep the weight down. The directions are not helpful and probably because this isn't an American manufactured product. It took about 10 minute for me to figure it out. USB connects in the rubber end. Be careful you don't break this-the attaching cover is rather flimsy.
The call sounds are clear and crisp with no echo or tunnel effect. The person I called said the sound was just like talking to me on the actual phone.
Directions for connecting:
Press and hold the power button (in middle of headset, mine is silver.# for about 7 seconds. It will blink blue when it's on.
To turn off, press the same button for another 7 seconds to power off, it will blink red.
To connect to a Bluetooth compatible device: From the 'off' position-Press and hold the power button. The headset will power through blue #don't let go!# and then start blinking blue AND red. It is then ready to connect. Make sure your device is discoverable.
Can't confirm connectivity with PS3 as we don't have one.

34463199 very nice speaker - unbelievably good sound for something so small - and at a reasonable price (imho)... syncs easily via bluetooth (a 3.5 male/male cord is also provided, along with a USB charging cord and carrying strap)... only odd thing is the volume/track switches are reverse of what i would expect (up/increase on the left, down/decrease on the right; and the power on/off is under a little rubber flap that also covers the USB port - doesn't look very waterproof to me, but i use it in the shower - not directly under the spray - and so far so good... but that's what drove the "4" in [ease of use])... if your phone rings while it's playing, the music stops and you can listen to the incoming call, but not answer it - that's ok with me, but maybe not for everyone (and why the "4" in [features]... all in all, a great value!

..

34463199 Pretty decent for the price. This works on all iPads except iPad mini. The keyboard is very small, it takes a while to adjust to. I'm happy that it's rechargable. Also, the keyboard is made out of silicone, so it's pretty quiet to type with. That has its setbacks though. It can sometimes get annoying having to go back and edit what you've typed because the keyboard is not sensitive enough. Oh well, you get what you paid for.

100% brand new with high quality; The heavy-duty cool metal enclosure protects the insides and keeps the unit cool by aiding in quick heat absorption and dissipation. This reliable splitter will take any HDMI signal (rev 1.3b) and duplicate the signal, sending the same high definition signal to 2 displays simultaneously. 2 x HDMI Outputs supporting up to v1.3b and 1440p. 1 x HDMI Input supporting up to v1.3b and 1440p. Supported Audio: LPCM,Dolby-AC3, DTS7.1, DSD/Dolby TrueHD/DTS-HD master audio. Essentially all available audio options are supported.

..

34463199 I bought this to connect the tv in the kitchen. I noticed that when I connect the splitter the tv in the living room drops from 1080i down to 720, if I disconnect the splitter it goes back up to 1080i. So if I want to watch the tv in the kitchen I have to re-hook the splitter, because you can really tell the diferance from 1080i and 720 on a 60" HD tv.

..

34463199 Great little device, arrived in just a few days (even with Free Shipping). Packaged nicely. I used the 1x2 HDMI Splitter to split the output of Playstation3 to a 55" Philips TV and a 21.5" Samsung monitor. Did basic testing of 480p, 720p and 1080i. Did extended testing of 1080p, seems to work well (the device also supports 576i and 576p, but I did not test these resolutions). Solid device, metal case, gets warm but not hot. At first, I did not notice the small instruction sheet, which says to power off the device when connecting or disconnecting HDMI cables (to protect your equipment and the splitter). So, I had the device powered ON when I set it up, but apparently there is no damage and everything is working well. After looking at other HDMI switching devices over $100, I was skeptical about this relatively inexpensive solution to my problem, but it is great. Can't comment on reliability because I just got it, but no complaints so far.

This is a wireless mouse, the signal can be reached for 10 meters, no need to install any drive, put it to a USB port, then you can easily use. It is more convenient than the the wire mouse. Because it throws off the curb of the range. As we known, the traditional optical mousse just has the 800DPI and the wireless mousse is 800DPI. What's more, they are not convenient and slow to use. Meanwhile, if that the computer does not have the mouse is a revolution, the scroll wheel of the mouse is a progress of human. So the optical mouse developed from 800DPI to 2400DPI is a great success. The 2.4G mouse will give you a more comfortable, convenient and exact effect. Would you like skiing? When you use it, you will feel the high speed. Buy it and enjoy it.


..

34463199 High quality wireless mouse from China works flawlessly, fits the hand well, overall design is pleasing, has a storage hole in the bottom flat surface for the tiny IR receiver so that when you take the mouse somewhere you won't lose the receiver - NICE IDEA! 5 STARS FOR THAT ( ***** ). Only issue is the product instructions are incomplete, nothing explains the reason for the 2 click keys on the left side and the tiny button on the top surface behind the finger wheel. Pressing these buttons apparently does nothing that I am aware of. Overall a GREAT BUY for a wireless mouse at about $9.00 USD. I highly recommend this product.

I don't have a lot of money so I try to find the best deals, the item itself was in great shape, the disk was just as great though I did have a little trouble installing the software because the License key didn't work but a quick e-mail and a little more waiting had that all cleared up, I would recommend this seller and will be buying from them more often, all in all it has great service, good speed response to problems, great quality products and great deals (I don't see why so many people are giving 1/5 stars...)

34463199 I purchased this for work because we needed an easy way to let clients sign eSignatures on some electronic healthcare forms. The product works in our eSignature boxes and on all of our computers. It was very easy to install and works alongside a previously installed mouse. It will automatically turn off when laid on its side to save battery power.
The biggest problem is the left mouse button is located on the left side of the pen, exactly where your thumb would lay if you were signing a document. As a result, mid-signature you may bump the button and trigger a pop-out settings window. You then need to clear the signature and start over. When you are using this with clients it can be frustrating, but it still provides a better signature than a normal mouse.
Incidentally, mine was supposed to come with a AAA battery but the product arrived without one (the space was clearly empty in the packaging).

34463199 I originally got this item to save from buying a new TV since I already have one that is 15 years old. It is a 32-inch so it is perfect for what I am needing it for. I am not going to spend a grand on a new television when I could be using what I already have. Sure, it may be old however it works that is the most important thing. This display adapter allows my computer to be displaying on my old television. It works great. Everything is great about it. I do not know why and I do not care that the audio has a little fuzzy sound when listening. It is not a problem. It is very faint. I am trying to give an accurate review so those who are thinking about this item can save time. I am grateful to The LORD of all hosts that I am in complete satisfaction. Thank you to my mom for working hard so I can play around with electronics. Hopefully The LORD of all hosts is bless and he bless my mom enough that I make her stay at my home a happy one in her old age. Amen.

34463199 I bought this about a week ago for $19.99 ... thought it was to good to be true for my old tv didnt even really think it would be any good but its FREAKIN AWSOME!!!! really dont believe it!!!!! comes with everything extra that you would need (vga cable, yellow composite, s-video and a usb power) even has a pass through vga port so you can keep both your monitor (if you have one) with the tv hooked up ... all i have to say is for once something cheap works!!!!! only issues iv had is that when i want to change to watch on tv i have to unplug and replug to get image clear

..

34463199 I bought this product hoping to connect a new laptop computer to an older big-screen TV. The TV only has video and S-video inputs and the computer only has HDMI and VGA outputs. I could not get a usable picture on the TV in spite of monkeying with the various
buttons. The instructions didn't adequately document what each button does. Perhaps if they did I would have been able to get a good picture.

34463199 I bought this about 15 days ago and it did not solve my purpose. When I connected my laptop to TV using this converter, it did not show up anything on the TV.

If you have got shelves full of old cassettes that have garnered more dust than your first grade spelling bee trophy, it may be time to don the face mask and sift through them. As you uncover hits by The Eagles, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder and Pat Benatar, it becomes blatantly obvious that the tapes can not just go in the trash. With the Tape to PC Recorder USB Walkman Cassette Player, you can convert all those cassettes into digital MP3 files. Want to experience the music as it actually sounded in the 80s? This nifty gadget can also play cassettes to give you that experience. Offering plug and play compatibility, it will be easier than ever to record those tapes onto your PC.


..

34463199 This was a gift for my husband as we have a lot of cassette tapes from our days with musical groups. We were both really excited about this until (despite what the instructions say) we discovered that it is not compatible with Macs. As we only use Macs, this has been turned into a useless paperweight. And, since returning with this company is a lot more "involved" than it would be if it were just through Best Buy, it will probably have to be resold on Ebay. If you have a MAC, don't bother.

34463199 For compact speakers with built-in sound boost, pretty good set of speakers. Certainly not the greatest sound, but what to be expected from speakers this size. At lower volume, sound only comes out of one speaker. Has to be turned up louder for both speakers to work.

This bundle includes one Remote Controller and one Nunchuk Controller for the Nintendo WII. The wireless Wii Remote not only gives better control, but also gives you more fun. Accentuating the sense of touch in the game lets you feel the heat of emotion with each movement. The Wii Remote frees you from cords and excessive, complicated buttons without sacrificing game play depth. The Wii Remote offers an intuitive, natural way to play games. The Nunchuk builds on the simplicity of the Wii Remote and goes an extra step to meet the needs of specific types of games. The Nunchuk connects to the Wii Remote at its expansion port and is used in conjunction with the Wii Remote. Along with the analog stick, the motion-sensing Nunchuk also contains two buttons positioned for quick access. Because the Wii Remote and Nunchuk are only relatively dependent on each other, players are free to hold them in whichever hand is most comfortable.


..

34463199 The remote looked exactly like the official Wii version. The remote we received had problems with the 2 button. It had to be pressed very hard to work and then only intermittently. The other functions worked perfectly. We got a refund rather than a replacement so I dont know if this is a common problem. The remote was part of a birthday gift and we didnt have time to wait on a replacement to be mailed. We bought a PDP afterglow remote at Best Buy to replace it.

It seemed to work as it should at first, but a week ago mylaptop suddenly gave me a "no battery dectected message" Out of nowhere, its as if no battery is attached to my laptop. Unless it is plugged in using the adaptor my laptop will not turn on and the battery will not charge at all its as if its not attached at all. I have only had this for seven months.

34463199 Very nice case great for typing and keeping your screen clean.

..

34463199 The keyboard is wonderful. It works as advertised. However the case itself is not the greatest. The case does not fit the Samsung Galaxy III Note 10.1. The cameras are covered by the case so when I want to take pictures I have to remove the tablet from the case. I don't like the angle when the tablet is in the upright position. Overall I would not purchase this again.

If you have got shelves full of old cassettes that have garnered more dust than your first grade spelling bee trophy, it may be time to don the face mask and sift through them. As you uncover hits by The Eagles, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder and Pat Benatar, it becomes blatantly obvious that the tapes can not just go in the trash. With the Tape to PC Recorder USB Walkman Cassette Player, you can convert all those cassettes into digital MP3 files. Want to experience the music as it actually sounded in the 80s? This nifty gadget can also play cassettes to give you that experience. Offering plug and play compatibility, it will be easier than ever to record those tapes onto your PC.


..

34463199 Instruction booklet so small you need a magnifying glass to read it...no joke. You are out of luck if your pc does not have a compact disc player to install software. Overall a very poor choice for what should be something simple and easy to do. Waste of money. Also return instructions from vender are way too complicated and impossible to deal with. I am stuck with it.

..

34463199 So i bought this with high hopes and some reservations given it's low price. It seems like a simple operation to turn a cassette tape into an mp3. However, the manual looks to have been written by someone who is only a half a semester through an english as a second language course. On top of that, the directions to get started aren't even right! They describe steps that don't occur. To top it all off, the lid doesn't fasten very well and pops up. Fortunately the tape and the recording will still continue despite that.

..

34463199 Purchased this recently. Hoping to transfer a number of old cassettes to digital format. Discovered with a number of different tapes and different connections (USB and the headphone jack) that the tape drive it's self is generating noise which is picked up by the recording/transfer.

..

34463199 We purchased a backup camera from Market Place and it was suppose to be water proof and have night vision. The night vision never worked and the first time I went through the car wash the camera was wet inside and I could not see through the lens. We called Market Place twice and left messages for them to call us back and they never returned our calls. We went to Best Buy and they told us they had no way of contacting them. I would never buy from Market Place again.

Agptek Keyboard/Cover Case (Portfolio) for 7" Tablet - PU Leather


..

34463199 I have only used the product for a couple of days. I charged the keyboard and then had to send back two Nexus 7s which were defective according to the Nexus Techs so a couple of weeks went by and I can't tell if the keyboard is fully charged or not. Indicator just glows red. A little tough getting the bluetooth keyboard to sync with the tablet but, success overall.
The look and feel of the case is good, a little tighth. It broke one of the keyboard keys off, loosing 1/2 the ting little hooks that afix it to the board but, thankfully it snapped back into place and appears to be holding. The cover must have slid at the wrong angle.
For twenty-nine dollars. . . . not too bad. It's worth it for a try.

34463199 The price seems a bit steep for the quality of the materials of which this scanner is made. The button 'sticks' a bit. I considered returning it, but time was of the essence and I didn't want to be left with no scanner for my intended purposes. The instructions were hideously convoluted. I finally understood to just plug it in and hit 'control, shift, 8 (or whatever) and it worked, but somehow seemed inconsistent in function. I also went on YouTube and they showed that you only had to plug the USB cable into your computer. I had no problem with it scanning barcodes except for the sticky control button. It was visibly 'depressed' from the moment I opened the package and I was afraid it would not work.

..

34463199 Cheap price and cheap product.
OK Picture quality and gets the job done for cheap but you wont be turning your old computer into a multimedia powerhouse or server if you want halfway decent picture quality.
May work better with a newer computer/video card but if you have an older tower and need it to connect to a TV - spend the little bit extra and upgrade your video card instead.

34463199 Because the newer lap tops do not have s-video anymore, I have no choice but to use vga for pc to tv graphics. S-video was very simple. I now have to use a vga converter box and have: the converter box and three or more extras cords to run, when s-video was just ONE cord, 'period', with a very small 1 inch adapter that transfers from the s-video to the yellow RC cord. I didn't need to have all those extras cords and a box laying around taking up room. Like they say: if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Put the s-video's back on the lap tops. Thank you

34463199 Do not buy this item. The seller does not provide any audio or HDMI cable with it. This is really unfair and you have to buy it separately. It is extremely light wait item. When I plugged the item with laptop through HDMI cable to TV, it did not provide the quality of picture that I was expecting. The biggest problem is no matter what resolution you setup the picture does not fit on TV screen. I tried one by one all the resolution option available on laptop but in vain. This is a bad item. Please dont waste your money.

34463199 Was looking forward to this but definitely did not live up to my expectations. Would not recommend

..

34463199 I would recommend this product 4 convenient use when using and iPad 2 it is also good to type without touching the screen

..

34463199 I bought this because the price seem right. At first inspection the product looks okay. Within minutes of use, a couple of the keys came off. I pushed them back in, but they only lasted a little while. It was easy to connect, battery life seems great, but it's just a cheaply made product. I would not recommend it to other users.

..

34463199 I think it's a good one for who would like to have a keyboard for ipad. It's very useful but the quality is not very good. Very easy to be broken. Anyway, it's good for this price.

..

34463199 Much easier to use than the pop-up on the iPad. Holds the iPad at a nice angle for work.

..

34463199 I got this open box and cheap as it was missing the charger in one of the stores. so for $35 this is unbeatable value the Ipad fits very smoothly into it and it successfully protects the screen. the keyboard is funstional and after owning it for a month i have had no problems with failure or quality of any kind.
I use this to take notes in class so it can be on for days at a time and ive never had it die on me as far as battery life goes. I charge it whenever I think about it.
Now my gripe about this device is the way the space bar is almost flush with a raised portion of the keyboard so if you type like I do where you hit the space-bar with the side of your thumb it can be a little jarring when the bar is kind of in the way and you miss a space from time to time.
Aside from that it works great and the space-bar issue can be gotten accustomed to... Its worth noting that the Logitech case has an opening in the front to allow for the space key to be hit easily.

Quickly print sharp documents with this HP LaserJet Pro M401dn network-ready black-and-white printer that features print speeds of up to 35 ppm* for fast results. Built-in wireless networking allows simple connection to the Web.


..

6006840530001 Out of the box, on the network and printing in just a few minutes.

..

6006840530001 BestBuy was terrific as I initially ordered the dn (duplex, network) model of this printer on-line - which was described as wireless - the feature that was very important since I share this printer with other users. BestBuy identified the issue on their website and made good by swapping the w (wireless) version. It to took hours on the phone and hours upon pick-up but everything was corrected. The printer is great and a work horse. Not only do I recommend the printer but BestBuy was terrific and it was great that they had a HP representative at the store where I picked up the printer who helped straighten this out and was a fount of getting the most functionality out of this printer!

..

6006840530001 Promoted as a wireless printer, but during set up found out that it had to be connected through ethernet to the wireless hub in order to use on the network. We have an HP laser jet thet is truly wireless & needs no cable connection to work. I thought this was the same. It is working now, but I was disappointed that it was not as I envisioned.

..

6006840530001 This is a fantastic machine, which I just purchased a month ago to replace a similar HP model from 12 years ago. I think this one is going to be as great as that one was. It is fast and the print is great!

..

6006840530001 We love it, the entire family own a laptop the wireless performance feature is great and the print quality is awesome

40295285 I really like this mouse, the bluetooth option to connect is great not having to have a usb dongle plugged in all the time

..

40295285 Works as advertised. Needed a mouse for my tablet and this does the trick.

..

40295285 This is my first bluetooth mouse, and for most similar mice, the user reviews complain about dropped connections happening on a regular basis - and accepted as just the price you pay for saving a USB port.
Well this mouse paired up with my laptop with no problem and I have seen not a single dropped connection in about 3 weeks of use. Laptop is a Macbook, running Windows 7 mostly.
Battery life: can't really comment yet - I haven't had to change batteries. But I do tend to switch off the power when I'm not using it, as I do with all non-wired mice. When switching back on, it connects back up again in under a second.
Comfort: I think I have average size adult male hands, but I find many mice too small and give me hand cramp. Not this one, good size and shape.

..

40295285 I used this with my bluetooth keyboard and my Samsung Pro Tab and was pleasantly surprised. More convenient than a laptop.

..

40295285 Handles well and feels great to the fingers! Easy to connect via bluetooth. Awesome purchase!

..

40295285 PERFECT FOR THE JOB.
IT GETS THE JOB DONE WITH EASE

..

40295285 I bought this out of necessity, but happened to be 50% off which was a great price.

..

40295285 Great bluetooth mouse, it paired quickly, worked on almost any surface and can be used with either hand. Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a bluetooth mouse.

..

40295285 This mouse is great for connecting to a tablet that does not have a USB port. It integrates smoothly and works perfectly with my venue 8.

..

40295285 I bought this mouse after looking at various bluetooth mice from other brands which were way too expensive. This was not only affordable, was really easy to setup on my Mac and works great and runs smoothly.

This Belkin slim folio case features dual functionality as a protective cover for your Samsung Galaxy 10.1" tablet and a convenient stand for comfortable viewing from multiple angles.


..

37563850 The case works well for protecting my tablet and looks nice too.

..

37563850 Works as advertised. It took quite a bit of work to insert the tablet into the case - be patient and it will go in.

..

37563850 nice case for the price, i got it on sale. but make sure tablet all the way in or it will block camera

..

37563850 Great protection for the tablet without being too bulky. The price was excellent and the cover looks sleek. The .com site was the only place I could find the cover, since all of the local stores cater to the "I" products.

..

37563850 My Belkin cover for my 7" Tab 2 fits perfectly. This cover for the 10+" Tab does not fit the same.

..

37563850 This is a great looking case/stand - my only complaint is that when the tablet was in it, the wi-fi was extremely slow, I thought something was wrong with the tablet and almost took it back. It later dawned on me to take the tablet out of the case - the tablet started working fine again. Don't know if I didn't insert it into the case properly but I doubt it. It had a very snug fit. Because of this I would give it 3 stars

Snap & Go Stay protected while showing off your new iPad with this barely-there snap on case. The hard plastic shell protects your device from damage and the soft touch finish adds extra grip for on the go use.


..

37563850 The case is not actually clear. Fit really well, but it's more opaque than clear and some of that was already scraping off when I got it

..

37563850 Without this the Smart Cover is really not worth having. This protects the back and makes it easy to grip.

..

37563850 Bought one for my first iPad, only replaced it when the corner chipped off and it looked really worn and yellowed!

..

37563850 this is to protect my IPad. My backpack fell out of the car and my IPad was in it. the cover saved my Ipad from being damaged.

..

37563850 Really liked this item the first time I purchased it to help protect my
ipad so when I needed another one I went back to purchase it again. Great item, I hope they continue to make it.

..

37563850 I have had an I-Pad for several years and have valued my Belkin - Snap Sheild Case because it protects it from drops and being bumped.

..

37563850 This cover has allowed my husband and I to easily tell apart our individual iPads.

..

37563850 .......this is quality protection. The shell works well. My wife carries the ipad everywhere and for ordinary use this protection is excellent.

..

37563850 I looked at every store in NYC and Portland for a totally clear snap on back to keep my iPad 's original look and feel. This was the only option and, thank goodness, it's perfect. Thanks again Best Buy!

..

37563850 I'm realistic in my review in that this product is very good at what it does, and Belkin knows it. The price is a bit steep but when considering the resale cost of my iPad will be directly affected by nicks, dings, and scratches on the back just as much as on the screen - this product should pay for itself when I go to sell it.
It doesn't get in the way, even when the Apple Smart Cover (sold separately) is folded behind the tablet. It also doesn't add weight or bulk to the device. I can easily remove it - and do so regularly - to clean dust out from between the iPad and the case.
There are cutouts that allow unfettered access to the ports and speaker. These are rather large - larger than need to be - so protection is less than perfect. I would be nervous shoving this into a backpack without checking first.

..

37563850 Very. Happy. I'm a customer. From best buy. 8 years Already. My favorite store For. Electronics

..

37563850 My household doesn't have a heavy set of printing needs, but we did have some requirements when we finally decided to get a new printer. We want something that would scan, copy, and print without much effort or complications. This printer is excellent. While we don't use it everyday, we know that when we need to, it's very easy, prints beautiful documents, and does so quickly.
I would recommend this printer for anyone with basic printing needs.

..

37563850 I replaced a older hp printer that I had for a while with this one.The wireless feature is great when it works but, that didn't last for too long.The simple task of printing a doc is a headache. The singal cuts in and out and print jobs are incomplete.And of course when I tried to get tech support it was out of warranty by a month.

..

37563850 The printer was great while it worked. However, the black ink stopped printing, and after confirming my ink is fine it appears to be an issue with the printer head. I can not remove the head to manually clean it, so essentially my new printer is now going to the dump.

..

37563850 I use this for my hojme office. It is great for printing and for scanning and copying short documents. The quality of the printing and copying seems to be good so far.

..

37563850 i bought this printer because my old one got old and boy what i was missing out on it has a lot of what i wanted in my old printer tec. is great

..

37563850 It is a really good printer. Easy set-up for the wireless and makes good copies also. It does seem to jam if the paper is not loaded just right - an easy fix though.

..

37563850 It so handy. Easy set-up. Wireless. It gives me great comfort when I
go wireless around the house while doing my reports.

..

37563850 For the listed price, this is a great deal. Solid performance and quick printing.

..

37563850 I love this printer. It was easy to set up and use plus it is wireless.

Boost productivity without spending a lot. This laser printer has the speed you need and available networking on select models. Compact and quiet, it is a perfect fit in any small office space. Plug it in and see how easy printing can be.


..

37563850 I have another color printer for other uses, but this printer prints out quickly and clearly for everyday use. The print quality is clear and sharp.

..

37563850 Printer is easy to setup and simple to use. It's a very reliable printer - we have multiple printers of the same model throughout our office, and we've actually started to replace all older models with this one.

..

37563850 Excellent printer for the money. It's a new model so recharged cartridges are not available yet, but they soon will be. I use it as a personal printer that replaced my old 4L. Comparing my old printer to this one is like comparing a VW Bug to a Ferrari.

..

37563850 I bought this laptop for school and personal use and I was so hesitated. However, the I didn't get disappointed at all. The laptop is fast and reliable with the Intel iCore 3 and the touch screen as sensitive enough but the TFT brightness is not as bright as SPL monitors but it looks awesome anyway. I love everything about this laptop even though I bought it refurbished. Keep up the good work Asus.

The Asus 15.6" K55A-RHI5N13 Laptop PC features an Intel Core i5-3210M processor, 6GB of memory, 750GB hard drive and Windows 8 for a superior computing experience. Two SuperSpeed USB 3.0 ports provide data transfer rates that are 10 times faster than USB 2.0.


..

37563850 I bought 3 k55n notebooks from Best Buy. A hard drive failed on one. Restoration disks are not included with the purchase. The restoration disks the computers make fail. One computer was unable to make the restoration disks. Asus Customer Service has no easy solution available to remedy the problems. Best Buy's solution is to sell extended warranties. I'm very disappointed with these notebooks by ASUS and that Best Buy would sell a product like this.

Microsoft Surface Tablet: Do more on the go with the productivity of a laptop in the compact size of a tablet. Create documents with Microsoft Office RT, sync files between Windows devices and video chat with friends and family. The built-in kickstand props up your tablet at just the right angle for easy viewing.


..

37563850 I'm not very computer literate. Most of the apps are easy to use - there are some things that I'm still not very versatile.

..

37563850 I have had my Surface for about six months and I love it! I was very skeptical as I used to have an Asus Transformer tablet that I thought was great. I loved the Google experience and wasn't to sure about Windows RT. I will say I am fairly impressed with Windows RT.
The tablet itself is built great. It is made of what Microsoft calls Vapor mag, which looks and feels great. The built in kickstand is very cool too. I use it quite often, along with the type cover, while at school. The only real issue I've found with the build is the black paint Microsoft uses to coat the back of the tablet. After using the Surface for several months it has started to chip slightly. Not a huge deal, but still a brushed finish may have been better.
As far as the operating system goes, it is a mix of very good and somewhat disappointing. The killer app for Surface is that it comes preloaded with Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and Outlook, making it a great tool for productivity. The OS is super smooth, far more than my android tablet ever was or even my Galaxy S4. It is quick and snappy, but can get bogged down if there are a ton of apps open. The app store however, is a bit lacking. It has most of the big name apps like Facebook, Netflix and Hulu but is missing some like Gmail and an official YouTube app, or Spotify. The apps in the store also lack the quality and polish that is seen on iOS and Android.
Overall I am pleased with the Surface. It excels at exactly what I purchased it for, which was to take notes and right papers for school and watch Netflix.

..

37563850 This was purchased as a gift for my daughter who loves it.

..

37563850 It is just an ok operating system, although it is the arm system, I wouild compare it to like chrome os. It is enjoyable to use with the many apps. that it will accept.

..

37563850 I bought this when I needed a new computer and would suggest it to anyone over an Apple product any day. Fast, reliable, portable the Surface Pro is a great machine. I can run Steam on this thing if I wanted to. Yes the app store isn't very good but who needs it when regular PC programs run on it.

..

37563850 it's a decent product and serves as a mini laptop if you buy a keyboard.

..

37563850 I bought this product when my laptop died as I am a student and figured it would be a good tool for taking notes in class. It was cheap and lightweight, and the battery lasted many hours. I must say, I really loved this little product and carried it with me all the time. I loved the touchscreen and got used to windows 8 pretty quickly.
Reasons I returned it: sometimes it connected to the internet. Most of the time it just said limited. At university it wouldn't even connect, when my old clunker of a laptop did it instantly. Most of the apps required internet to run, I couldn't access my files from skydrive or dropbox, couldn't do my research. I got frustrated enough with it just sitting there and me not being able to use it whenever I wanted that I simply returned it. I looked at how much I paid with all the accessories and figured i'd be better off with a touch screen laptop. The left speaker was also very staticky, and the sound was not clear so I couldn't watch movies or listen to music unless I had headphones in. I sent messages to microsoft and never heard back. I bought it back to the store and was never offered a replacement device, they just grumpily refunded me, so I guess the store lost out on my sale, as if I would have been offered another device that didn't have the internet connection problems, I would have gone for it. But now i've moved on and likely will purchase a ASUS Transformer if I decide to get another tablet, as the keyboard is included, not purchased for $150 more.

..

37563850 I bought this for work. It's light weight so it's ideal for me. It's really a great product; it's got word, and the apps are really easy to use.

..

37563850 Purchased for use specifically to use at work writing evaluations. For easy to use in car and even without keyboard easy to type on. Learing to use Windows 8 was a bit of a curve, but overall love this thing.

..

37563850 Got this tablet for the office compatibility. 32gbp is plenty of saving size when used with the micro sd slot.

AfterShokz Bluez open ear wireless headphones combine the convenience, reliability and performance of Bluetooth wireless connectivity with the comfort and safety of open ear bone conduction technology to provide consumers with an entirely new way to stay connected. Unlike conventional Bluetooth headphones and earbuds that use the eardrums to transmit sound, Aftershokz Bluez headphones utilize patent pending bone conduction technology to deliver sound through the listener's cheekbones to the inner ear. This enables anyone using them to make/take phone calls and stay connected to both what they are listening to and the outside world - from warning sounds outdoors while walking or driving to a nearby colleague in an office setting.


..

43328706 First, it is not fair to compare these to any other earphones as they do not send sound from your output device to the brain by way of the same path. These earphones do not actually transmit sound at all and they do not have speakers. They transmit impulses from 2 small pads through the skin to the bones in the upper jaw near the ear. Your ear canal is open and can hear ambient sounds as easily as it normally does when not using headphones. The impulses cause the bones in the inner ear (beyond the eardrum where sound is normally recieved) and the bones vibrate. The result is sound that is not actually heard with the ear. It actually sounds as though the sound is coming from inside your skull. This is the same technology that doctors have used to make it possible for people who are completely deaf to hear again and the result is that you will hear subtle sounds in your music that you never noticed before. This is serious futuretech. However, if you are the kind of person that likes to assault their eardrums with booming base and virtually no midrange or highs (as with over the ear Beats by Dre) - avoid these as you will find the range on these phones to give the same attention to the full audio range rather than only the base. The up side is that you cannot cause these earphones to distort. Distortion is actually impossible. You cannot blow these earphones out by cranking them up to high.

43328706 I purchased this unit when my old router died. I knew I needed something that had more additional speed, and this has fit in nicely. It is extremely easy to set up with the use of the dvd that is included. Once you set up your password and name, it does most of the work for your to set up your home network. There is no need to have the geek squad out to install it for you as long as you can follow onscreen directions.

..

43328706 Very good router for the money. Long range and easy to set-up

43328706 great performer and super easy to use. feels avg for the price, but hard to compare

..

43328706 router was reasonably priced, simple to setup & so far, has been a soid product

..

43328706 This was my first experience making my home wireless and I was very impressed. I have several wireless items connect and it work great.

..

I'm operating two laptops, iPad and PS3 without interruption in the wifi signal.

..

43328706 Easy to set up. Works with all my devices (Laptop, PS3, PanasonicTV).
No drop outs, even though the router is in a closet and near the ground.
Nice piece of equipment.

..

43328706 Had working in a few minutes, good range - no hassle

..

43328706 I've used NetGear and Belkin routers up until now. They have worked well but are painful to set up / configure, etc. Not this bad boy. The software is SLICK. It was actually pleasant - yes pleasant - to set this up. It works like a dream and hasn't crashed yet (knock wood). The only thing I'll say as a critique is that the wireless throughput doesn't seem to be as fast as my Belkin router, but I haven't actually measured it.

43328706 this is a great little boombox,i can said that sounds better than the mini bluetooth bose speaker,im very please with this speaker

..

43328706 I love it! This speaker system is awesome! I use it for both my Iphone and my Kindle Fire with no problems. If both devices are turned on, I sometimes have to go to settings to get it to connect to the logitechj but it's no big deal. I bought this to "replace" the logitech Z515 which only has two speakers and I am half deaf so I needed something that I could hear and rock out to. This battery powered system wont "raise the roof" but the sound quality is good. It is also easier to "pair" devices to than it's smaller cousin the Z515. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars they didnt make a bluetooth dongle to go with it like they did the smaller one. Battery life could be better but that's true with just about everything

..

43328706 I have had this for about 4 months now and really put it through the ringer. I was mainly looking for something to use to stream Slacker and Pandora from an android phone. As long as you know what you are getting you will definitely not be disappointed. If you are looking for something to replace your Bose system or rattle the windows of your house with thumping bass then this is not for you. However if your looking for something for a condo or to fill one floor of your house this is great. The sound has good range and the bass is more than adequate. The portability is great, I take it out on the back patio and have about 30 feet of range with the blue tooth no problem. Haven't fully tested the battery life but it was still going strong with the battery indicator in orange after 2 1/2 hours. If you catch it on sale at around $119 it is a steal. Highly recommended.

..

43328706 Incredible sound for size and price point. Pair this with an iPod Touch and you have great streaming music anywhere.

..

43328706 Bought it for my son who loves to listen to music on the iPad. As soon as the devices paired and the music started playing we were both amazed how the speaker filled the room. My son loves that he can walk without wires and control the volume and playlist from the iPad. It's also great that this thing has a rechargable battery so you can take it anywhere, and I'm pretty sure you can get at least a few hours from it because we accidentally left it playing on the back porch for about 4 hours and it still sounded great. Forget docking stations - go Bluetooth!

..

43328706 It,t simply the best sounding bluetooth speakers for the money.
I was impresses when I got home and turned them on.
The base level sound is also great
If you are looking for bluetooth speakers I would suggest listening to these.

..

43328706 For the cost I thought it was a good by to bluetooth all my Apple devices but sadly this one does not. It only paired with my iTouch that I purchased over 4 years ago. I trust the Logitech brand but I guess they r going to have to step it up and get the bluetooth pairing for all versions of Apple products together.

..

43328706 Wow!! Thought these speakers were gna be over rated, but they turned out bad a**, especially for the price. The Bluetooth is great on this. Can't go wrong with this, and that's cuz I had my doubts, its great!!

..

43328706 I had purchased a Phillips night stand Android Dock Clock radio which had good sound quality ( not as good as this one) and need something that was portable with a battery. Bass is lowered when on battery power but has a punch when plugged in. This Logitech Boom Box is loud, had it on and the windows open and my Neighbor 2 house down could he and make out what song and band I was listing to. No distortion at the highest level of volume. might be too much sound for a dorm room or bed room, great for a living room.
Not a good purchase to use with your laptop/ tablet to play games or watch movies via bluetooth unless you are going to use the 3.5mm head phone cord supplied.

..

43328706 Ive owned a lot of speakers, professional and home. But my last iHome sounded horrible. this has power, especially if your sitting near a plug, even off plug it is nice, but the amp will struggle eventually. nice add-on to a beach outing or simple family pool party. I will recommend this to anyone looking for a nice speaker set for a range of use such as at a job for installation and travel.

Logitech S715i Speaker System - iPod Supported


..

43328706 I am happy with this item, it was great purchase for the price

..

43328706 This speaker is the best out of all the ones we listened to! I would recommend to anyone. The doc is made for the older iPod, but we use it with out iPod 5 connecting it with a cord. Still works great. Love the portability. Big enough in size to produce outstanding sound, small enough to take places. A charge lasts a pretty long time. I highly recommend this speaker.

..

43328706 I bought this product for my office and could not be happier. It is very simple to use, sounds great and the remote works very well!

..

43328706 bought one for my brother because we loved our's so much and it really charges up ipod/itouch quickly and the speakers are awesome...sound quality is great

..

43328706 I really love and enjoy this great speaker, I always opened it when I am at home, it gives me the fun and pleasure

..

43328706 I've had this product for about 6 months now after my bose dock died after years of service. I didn't have as much to commit to a dock this time around as last time, and decided to give this a shot, it's easily portable, the battery life is solid, it has an auxiliary input jack so you can use other mp3 players with it, and really can't be beat for the money.
sound quality: The highs are crisp and clear, and the bass is soid, the mids however seem to be emphasized on here which is odd, because in most modern docks the mids seem forgotten. It probably has to do with the radiators on the back. Despite the mids being powerful, they don't over power everything.
this is a solid dock and should be the go to for best buy shoppers looking for a dock.

..

43328706 This is the most surprising electronic I have ever purchased. It far exceeded any expection I had. The sound is full, the bass is solid, the treble is clear. One can play it for hours on battery, although the volume level is slightly higher when it is plugged in. I have used this with my Sansung Galaxy SIII playing Pandora at parties, and it has worked really well. I highly recommend it for the $.

..

43328706 I bought these speakers a year ago. At that time I had an iphone and I loved the fact that I could charge my phone while listening to music. The sound quality is AMAZING with these little speakers and I am very picky when it comes to sound because I LOVE MUSIC.
I ditched my iphone and went back to my droid. I can still use it with the USB port, although it doesn't charge my phone. Quick solution though, I just charge my phone in the wall socket while listening.
It's great for parties and is surprisingly loud. I love that you don't have to have it plugged up either; however, I do notice the volume does go down quite a bit when you have it unplugged. I love the kickstand.
The bag it comes with is quite a joke, there's no way it will protect these precious speakers. That's okay though, I don't travel much but when I do, I make sure these speakers come with me.
I did a lot of studying before buying these speakers and I am so glad I listened to all the positive reviews. You won't be disappointed!

..

43328706 Recently purchased this to dock, charge, and play my iPod Touch. I am amazed at the quality sound this small unit delivers. I would rate this on a scale of 1 - 10 at 11. Solid unit and extremely easy to use. The remote is "tiny" but works well (up to 15 ft. away) to advance through playlist, pause, and adjust sound. This is a very affordable alternative to Bose and will not disappoint you.

..

43328706 Bought one for my daughter 18 months ago, one for my wife 14 months ago, and a second for my wife a month ago. All work well, sound quite good and are very portable. My wife wanted a second one for the beach house.

Enjoy on-the-go Web access with this BlackBerry 9000 NO CAM cell phone that features Wi-Fi capability for quick and easy access to online content, social networks and more. The QWERTY keyboard makes it easy to type and send text messages.


..

33454194 Bought 4 phones for a family that depends heavily on communications. The phone delivers each time, every time. Love the larger keyboard for us fat finger people. The operating system is very easy to set up, learn and use.

..

33454194 
The latest smartphone from Blackberry is here, The Q10 is a smartphone with a full QWERTY keyboard. it runs RIM's new BlackBerry 10 OS, and has a 3.1-inch display, A 1.5 GHz processor with 2 GB of RAM and 16GB of onboard storage.The back of the BlackBerry Q10 is made out of a fancy, glass-like material that is claimed to be stronger, thinner, and lighter than the plastic used in many handsets today.


..

33454194 As a previous Blackberry user, I was pleasantly surprised how well I took to this phone. I had been using a legacy device for years and then switched to Apple for work but then decided to go back to Blackberry. I was a little disoriented at first due to the absence of the trackpad and tool belt, but caught on quickly. BB10 is a huge improvement from the previous OS I had been using (BBOS7, I believe on my Bold 9900). As expected, the build quality is top notch. I've always had a black Blackberry device, so changing it up and getting this white Q10 was a nice change. The keyboard is surprisingly good compared to the curved keyboard of the 9900 I was used to. It's a toss up, though, between which I like better. Battery life is stellar and satisfyingly lasts a full 8-hour "work" day with heavy use. I found that the few apps I downloaded and used via Amazon Appstore drained my battery quite a bit, so I just deleted all those since I can do without and will probably stick to native Blackberry apps via Blackberry world. The Hub took some time to get used to but now find it convenient as you can just swipe to the left to access email and the like. As expected, email push and organization is stellar. Although I don't use my phone for work, I love having a physical keyboard once again and will continue using a phone with one. I'm more than satisfied with the phone's performance and am happy to have received a -1 model so that I get AT&T's LTE service. Thank you, Best Buy! P.S. I would purchase a white Z30 for media purposes, an unlocked -1 and even -5 model phone if Best Buy offered it.

..

33454194 First of all, I would like to point out this ships as though it is an international phone. Meaning it does not come with the standard United States charger. It does not say this in the product description so if you don't already have a charging base that can attach to a USB charging base you may have to buy one.
This is a great improvement from the Blackberry Bold 9900. Excellent quality and very easy to use. The keyboard is a lot more finger friendly and is very easy to use. The screen size is an improvement, even though it is only slightly bigger you can definitely notice it.
Although it is only a 2100 mAh battery, it has extended battery life considering it has only a 3.1 inch screen. It also comes with dark themes for main apps that allows for an extended battery life as well. Being a heavy user it definitely outlasts the BlackBerry Z10.
The screen size is up for debate on how it compares to a full touch screen phone. I enjoy the size of the screen and find it suits my needs as I prefer to have a constant physical keyboard. However, if you didn't like how small it was think about this. The iPhone and BlackBerry Z10's screen sizes are 4.0 and 4.2. You are only losing an inch of screen which is actually lost on both the iPhone and BlackBerry when the keyboard is active on these phones. Essentially then, with the keyboard active on either of those phones, you end up using the same screen size.
A slight disappointment is that although you can get up to 3 rows of icons (only one less than the full touch screen BlackBerry Z10), they shrink the space between rows instead of shrinking the size of the icons. They can seem a little unnecessarily big on the smaller screen.
Overall however I really enjoy this phone and prefer it to my other full touch screen devices.

33454194 the phone i bought from best buy came from claro panama.it did not have wifi calling as advertised.It will not, after a whole day of calls with bb and carrier, update software from carrier for wifi,Its old old os!!!
spefcific to central america.returned it
Tom Z

..

33454194 The best phone i have used till now. This has great clarity.

..

33454194 1.First and for most, to me the best attribute of Q10 is its crystal clear call quality, speaker and sound that incomparable to any other device
2.always great reception
3.long battery life, plus battery is replaceable , so i will always have battery that can hold charge up to 2 days
4.build quality, strong and pleasant to the touch, it feels very nice in the hands, made of premium materials
5,keyboard buttons, it feels much better typing on actual buttons, plus there is bunch of shortcuts that touchscreen don't have
6.
as far as software--
ui is smooth
browser is super fast
camera features are nice
hub is useful
swipe features are clever
native apps looks great
cons- not all the downloaded apps from bb world work well
if you are coming from iOS things you will like
great reception, call quality, hub for all notifications, faster typing experience, longer battery life, buid quality is more sturdy, better security of the platform( to whom it matters)
thinks you won't like- you want like preinstalled apps like maps, fb, ln, twitter, whatsapp- they all don't run as smooth as on iOS, also some big name apps missing- instogramm, Netflix, vine, viber, bank apps
You won't be able to sync through cloud to your macbook or iPad.
you won't have siri, even thou there's pretty good voice commend app, but it is not as polished as siri
if you are coming from previous gen bb
you will like- speed, speed, speed- this ui is much faster, browser is super fast compared to older bb, you will get more apps, better screen resolution, a bit bigger screen, same quality battery life, 4G speed, better camera, hub
you won't like making an adjustment to new user interface, you will be missing trackpad and dedicated call buttons at first, you won't like some modifications to apps, you will find some shortcuts from older bb missing.
if you are coming from Android (sg)
You will like buid quality, you will love call quality and you will be amazed by battery life, you will like having familiar features like nfc. you will like having hdmi port, expendable memory, you will like typing on keyboard and keyboard shortcuts. you will like new ui, and security features of blackberry- being able to decide what type of personal info each app can get, and protected privacy of bb communication.
you won't like Size ( its much different from galaxy) , you won't like not having some apps, and having some that don't work as good as on android,
I recommend this phone to everyone, as long as you are informed about what it does great and what it not.

..

33454194 I have had this phone for about 3 weeks. I use it with tmobile and I get the non-LTE 4g. This i a snappy device that beats any other phone that
I have purchased off contract. With my old phone there was a lot of lag while playing games, but not with this phone. The camera is good for the simple pictures that I take. The battery is great when the phone is not searching for service. Otherwise, a lot of battery power will be used for cell stand by. The call quality is good and clear after you get adjusted to the size of the phone. The screen looks great even with the brightness around 50 percent. I would recommend this phone to anyone that has good service in their area for their carrier. Tmobile upgraded edge to 3g+ in most major cities. Also, the phone comes with a screen protector and a clear silicone case. Probably because it is hard to find aftermarket accessories.

..

33454194 this phone is amazing. I would recommend anyone to buy this who has at&t or tmobile. it has a beautiful screen at 720p (not quite 1080p but still good)
the price on this is unbeatable for what you get; charger, case, screen protector.
I would give this phone a 4.5 of 5 stars.
the only real issues is the small ammount of storage but there is an sd card slot.

33454194 This takes a REGULAR sized sim card. I use At&T prepaid service. Works great. I bought one, and got my two brothers to buy them too. Great phone. No issues so far.
Down side- no cases. I purchased a Rocketfish Silicone Galaxy S3 case, and cut out for the camera/usb port. works great for me. The sku is: 5744259 model number: RF-SGS3T2S

..

33454194 Im only being harsh because I know blu is a small company. Therefore they should have better quality than a rushed assembly line like corporation. I got this phone last night and it stopped working today around 1:50pm. It wont turn on unless I remove the sd card, sim card, and battery. The slightest movement and plugging it up to the charger makes it turn off again. I think I am an isolated case though. My phone must be defective. I have t mobile and I know blu phones dont work well with t mobile , but this cant be the cause. Overall though from what I was able to see in my small time of ownership it was a sleek phone with cool amenities and cutting edge technology. It can even take screen shots. (which is the action that started this malfunction). The battery life is very short though, but I did have a lot of apps. Its extremely light weight as well. Over all If your looking for an affordable smart phone you should check it out, but be weary because it could also be a defective.
*I had a hard time trying to find out what was going on. There is no information on the website, google, or the phone manual about technical issues. There also isnt a phone number. I had to email them and wait patiently for a response

This Electrohome Signature EANOS700 stereo system plays back vinyl records, CDs and MP3s and features 4 speakers with tuned chambers, so you can experience your favorite music in crisp hi-fi quality. A built-in USB port lets you record vinyl to MP3.


..

41110985 Let me put it to you this way, I research any product I am about to buy over $100. After viewing countless turntables/record players on Amazon and music stores and other websites, I was almost sick and tired of it and just ready to give in and buy a Crosley vintage player with tape and CD. That was before I decided to invest a bit more and buy this one. Was I right! I must have viewed 3 days worth of reviews of players and still could not make up my mind. Spending a bit more pays off. Not only does this have the look of a vintage player with CD and USB included (forget about tape, no reason for it unless you need it), but it sounds great and is really all you need. It came within 2 days with Prime and is quite a large carton packaged securely. I took it out and I had an old computer cabinet I bought at Target not being put to good use since I bought a Macbook Pro. This player actually fits nicely into the space where the computer was and I store the records below it and it even opens nicely. The wood on this thing is beautiful and the top opens and latches securely.
Now for anyone purchasing this, when you get it in place, be sure to read the glaring yellow sticker inside the record player portion since not only do you have to ensure you remove all the foam packaging holding everything in place, you have to SCREW DOWN the large screw sticking up behind the turntable. If you do not, the record will wobble and you will not be able to increase the sound. I neglected to do this and was wondering why it sounded horrible. Once this happened it is fine. However I tried to remove this fluorescent sticker from the inside and it was a mess. Be sure to either leave it or be careful tearing it off. Everything works perfectly and so far so good. I have not tried the CD player but the radio tunes in fine and sounds good not that I will ever use it. I would highly recommend this item!

..

41110985 We chose the Electrohome for the ability to play multiple media types. It is very easy to use and the sound quality is great!

..

41110985 This stereo system is great for new generation music buffs who would like to experience the sound of a vinyl record. Music lovers from previous generations will definitely be able to quell their nostalgia for "old" technology, classic design and craftsmanship.
I would have liked to receive an instruction booklet with information as to finding replacement needles and vinyl record care supplies when the need arises.

..

41110985 This is a fun item to hear all of the LPs that have been laying around unplayed for years. The conversion to MP3 allows me to play them in the car which has a USB input.

Protect your Apple iPod touch in style with this shock-absorbing case that features a convenient design that allows for easy access to the controls and dock connector and a patterned, textured design for an attractive look and improved grip.


..

41016920 It is a neat touch to keep my ipod in good condition. With my life (and all the kiddos) things are always getting ruined or messed up. This has saved my ipod through rough and tough days. My only issue is turning it off is a bit difficult because where the button is, there is a cover and you have to push hard. I think they should have made it softer or just put a hole or something there. Otherwise I like it

..

41016920 I got this case for my new iPod Touch 3G and while it is visually attractive and hot pink it is a pain. It was hard to put on and even harder to take off. Once its on, its on. Meaning, everytime I want to put my iPod in an armband case I have to take the case off. It does protect the iPod but leaves so much to be desired.

This 2-line speakerphone features automatic line selection and line status indication for convenient call management. The answering system features up to 12 min. of digital recording time for each line.


..

41016920 Overall the phone is easy to use and meets all of my expectations from an AT&T product. Would like the microphone on the handset to be a bit clearer and more sensitive. The large buttons makes dialing easy and clear.

..

41016920 I hoped this phone would work out, because there aren't many 2 line corded phones with an answering feature. This phone replaced a very old Panasonic KXTMC98B.
I had no complaints about audio quality from the party on the other end of the line, and other parties would come in clearly to me, but for some reason, I would hear distortion in the receiver when I would speak, a slight annoyance
The speakerphone works pretty well for a phone in this price range.
A few complaints about the answering system. Once your messages are played, and you determine the message is for someone else in the household and you do not delete the message, there is no old message indicator to key someone to check, as did my old Panasonic, unless you press the play button again. Secondly, hangups are often recorded as messages. The old Panasonic did a better job at distinguishing legit messages.
Lastly, I ended up having to return this phone. It was wall mounted, and intermittently, the hook switch did not fully engage and the phone would be off hook for hours on end. I returned it to the Best Buy store, but because it was only available online, I was unwilling to wait another 4-5 days for a replacement. I picked up the same model off the shelf at another retailer (they price matched BB). I have not experienced any hook switch problems, but the audio and answering machine complaints remain.

..

41016920 This 2-line phone was easy to install & easy to use.

..

41016920 I bought 3 phones. Use them all at my office and they work great so far! Love the caller id feature and answering machine.

..

41016920 Was a gift for my dad, he had me return it for him

..

41016920 Good value for price. Looks good and has all the working features a small business would need.

..

41016920 We have purchased two of these phones. The second phone, purchased on November 17, 2010, seems to be ok. No problems, but, the first phone, purchased on November 5, 2010, continually looses the 'Speed Dial' numbers. I put them all back in and in a matter of minutes or hours or days, some will dissapear. Not always the same numbers, but several. I am beginning to think that this phone has a technical problem and should be replaced. I will be contacting Best Buy to see about a replacement. Thank you.

..

41016920 Bought this phone for my mother. The phone displays the caller ID on Call Waiting but displays only "Incoming Call" for normal calls. I would have rated the phone very good if not for that. It took nearly three weeks to conclude that the phone was at fault. So it's now too late to return it. it seems that the only viable option is to simply junk the phone and replace it with another brand that's more reliable.

35491932 I love the capacity of this processor. Incredibly quiet and fast. The only negative is that I tried to shred some carrots. The majority was shredded well; however, it couldn't shred all of my carrots. I don't know if the processor can only handle a certain quantity or what.

..

35491932 was reluctant to buy because previous reviews called this hard to clean. I have done everything imaginable that this machine has been designed for and have had no trouble betting it spotless. storage for extra attachments is by gallon ziploc bag.

..

35491932 This was my first food processor and I really wanted to buy a good one, so I did a lot of internet research. Money was not really an issue, but I still love a good deal.
The Cuisinart Elite 12 cup was really a bargain compared to the 11 cup Cuisinart that I almost purchased. The thing that sold me right off the bat were the cutting blades. The slicing blade is adjustable and functions as multiple blades. Same with the shredding blade which is reversable. The 11 cup model was less expensive, but not when you started buying additional blades and discs. This unit is larger, more powerful, and better value than the smaller one.
Another great feature is the way the lid seals with a rubber, spring-loaded gasket. The other one doesn't have it - just plastic on plastic. Also, this model has an inner bin that you can put inside the 12 cup bin if you want to process smaller amounts of food.
If you are going to buy a storage box for the blades, there is one available for this model that holds all the blades and discs. Really awesome setup!
This unit is heavy and powerful and quiet too. I wasn't sure I was going to like the silver color because I really wanted polished stainless, but this color is close and looks very high-end in my new kitchen.
The included DVD and cookbook are nice too, especially for someone like me who is new to using a food processor. Additionally, Bestbuy.com matched the Amazon price and shipped fast and free, so I couldn't be happier with my purchase.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

35491932 The Cuisinart - Elite Series 12-Cup Food Processor has a quiet and very powerful motor.

..

35491932 Great product, nice double bowl set up and the gasket makes using liquids super simple for cleanup. This model is super powerful and very fast. It looks great and the stainless steel body blends in perfectly with all of my appliances.

..

35491932 I have never had a food processor before, and now I will never go without one. I love this product!!

..

35491932 I can't say enough about this food processor. It is very quiet, very powerful and fast. We made enough coleslaw to feed and army in under 5 minutes. Cleanup was a snap and it stores nicely. Buy this machine today!

..

35491932 I bought this processor from Best Buy over a year ago and am very satisfied. Worth every penny. Lots of power, quiet and processes everything perfectly.

..

35491932 I had my previous Cusiniart for 25 years...this new design is easy to use and works wonderfully. I use a food processor 4-5 times a week and life is simpler with it.

..

35491932 This food processor is really awesome! It chops food in a flash! It is so useful. Don't know what I did before I bought it. Highly recommend.

..

35491932 We started making a lot more salsa type and sliced salads and this processor makes the job a little easier. It takes a little practice to get perfect slices like they do in the included video, but it does slice everything a lot faster than we can do it by hand.
Making salsa and chopped up salads is quicker too, you just throw everything in, including spices and it mixes everything for you. Pour it in a bowl, let it rest a bit, and it's ready to go.
I love the dough blade, kneading dough has never been easier. Throw everything it, take it out and shape it, put it on a baking sheet and bake. (You would have to let it rise if you are doing a yeasty bread.) We've been making fresh bread every week!
Clean up can be a chore, but it is well thought out and with the included tool, it's pretty easy.

..

35491932 Love love love this food processor! Easy to clean, does a great job and creates tasty recipes so much easier!

..

35491932 Yea, $300 is a lot for a food processor, but after going through 3 units that cost about $50-$70 a piece, I decided the next one was going to be something that would last. This thing is built like a tank. I do not expect to have the issues with this one I've had with the cheaper units. The three bowl system works very well. Super-quiet also.

..

35491932 it's an open floor item and the price is even cheaper and it works perfectly

..

35491932 Jus twant to tell you the sales person was amazing that was the reason we bought it, plus we did need a new one.

..

35491932 I was looking for an easy to install over the range microwave , I had this product for two months now and I am very happy with its quality ..,,

..

35491932 Moved into apartment that had old over-the-stove fan but no microwave. Yanked out old fan and installed this microwave that has a fan and light for stovetop. Used everyday by busy mom and kids.

..

35491932 It didn't come with a Plate for the inside or the roller or the bracket to mount it up. other than that it heats up good and for $50 i couldn't resit not buying it.

..

35491932 We've purchased the expensive top of the line and they don't last. That's why we went with a cheap one this time.

..

35491932 The microwave was sold at a good price, but when best buy came to install it, it was missing pieces and so we returned it.

..

35491932 A terrific built-in microwave. Works like a dream! But installing the microwave was really difficult and frustrating. Other than the installation, we love our new microwave and would purchase another Amana product.

..

35491932 I had been looking for an over the range microwave for some time, and the sale over Labor Day clinched the deal. The installation was a little challenging because I had to adapt the components, but once installed it is great. The position is much more conducive to using it and the counter space opened is very handy. I would definitely install an oven, and from my experience withe the Amana I would be very likely to chose the same model.

..

35491932 If you want an inexpensive microwave that does the basic things that a microwave is supposed to do, this is a very good choice. I am not what you would consider to be a handyman, but this was very easy to install. Needed a helper just to lift and hold in place during the installation.

35679603 Great printer. Purchased for multiple functions, but haven't had chance to use all the features yet.

..

35679603 it works well and has eprint so it's convenient. There is feeder for multiple pages so it's nice when you have multiple pages to print. Also, it's not too bulky so it fits well for a home office. overall a great buy

..

35679603 Prints on paper, card stock, photo paper, fabric beautifully .

..

35679603 I purchased my first MX452 in December 2012 as I wanted a wireless printer on the main floor of my house (the router, etc. is in a basement office). I think I have used every possible function on the MX452 with ease. My only compaint would be that it seems to use a lot of ink (black as well as colors) but the functionality far outweighs this minor shortcoming. The MX452 recently came up as a deal of the day and I liked my current MX452 so much that I bought a second for my son who will be headed off to college this coming fall.

..

35679603 I had all cannon printers before and was very pleased. This one is a three and one and is Multi functional. Easy to install and includes a DVD for easy installation, Will highly recommend.

..

35679603 Got this on a sale at a great price. Even at full price it's a great deal. Connects easily to wireless LAN for access throughout the house. Print quality is very good.

With built-in Wi-Fi and a 1.2GHz NVIDIA Tegra 3 processor, this Asus Nexus 7 90OK-S0MI11020U tablet lets you quickly browse Web pages and stream Internet-based media. The 7" 10-finger multitouch display simplifies navigation.This product has been refurbished.  Learn more.


..

35679603 I bought this because I needed a a tablet to test the Android Apps I am building on a tablet layout. It is in great physical condition and the software is always good on Android, but I could only get a wifi signal when I was about 5 feet from the router. After doing some research I saw that many people had issue with the wifi connectors being either bent down too low or broken off. I opened the back cover and realized this did not even have an antenna on the inside of the cover.
Lucky, or not lucky I guess, I had a Nexus 7 that was my Mom's. It wouldn't hold a charge and eventually wouldn't even charge at all. Another flaw in this version of the N7, but it was beyond warranty. Anyway, I pulled her cover off and it had the antenna on the cover, so I just switched covers and BAM! great wifi signal all over the house.
Asus Refurb techs, don't forget the wifi antenna's on these. Most consumers would have no idea to check that and just think they have another poorly designed product. You also should have offered free repairs on the battery connection problems on the early versions of these tablets, even to consumers who's warranty had expired.

..

35679603 Got this refurbished for a great price and have not regret it at all. Wonderful machine for reading or just looking up information while watching TV.

..

35679603 The product itself is great lil I satisfied that best but sent me a phone charger instead of tablet charger but since I have more than one we use same charger.

..

35679603 I gave a nexus 7 to my godson for Christmas when they first came out a couple years ago. Recently he accidentally dropped it face down and the screen got a tiny crack that messed up the touch sensor. I got this refurbished one to replace it...loaded up all the previous stuff from the play store, and it has worked absolutely flawlessly. It did have kind of a cryptic message when I turned it on for the first time, but a simple reset to factory defaults cleaned that up. I picked up a better protector that covers the screen now too. I think it's totally awesome that you have refurbished ones for a little more than 1/2 price of the originals.

..

35679603 I bought this device and loved it, but after one week it shutdown and didn't came back, so just returned this.

..

35679603 I bought two and I love them. they work fine but after few uses one of them just shut down for good while the other freezes up sometimes in less than 2 weeks. as soon I got the first one after a week I ordered another two but now I will cancel and return the ones I have before the 15th day. they are great tablets but no more refurbished devices. this is first and it will be the last.

KILL BACKGROUND NOISEJawbone ICON HD is equipped with the world's most advanced noise cancellation technology, military-grade NoiseAssassin 2.5 with wind reduction. Originally developed for use by tank commanders and helicopter pilots, NoiseAssassin is a proprietary technology that eliminates unwanted background noise when you talk on the phone. It gives you the freedom to enjoy quiet phone conversations wherever you are. Whether you're at a noisy airport or on the road, your speech will sound crystal clear.LISTEN IN HDMusic, video and calls never sounded better. With its large 10mm wideband speaker - our biggest, most powerful speaker yet (25% larger than ICON) - Jawbone ICON HD lets you privately listen to music, podcasts, YouTube videos, sports, phone calls and more in full-spectrum, HD-quality sound. It's the most convenient way to enjoy all your mobile media and calls in one place. You'll be totally hands-free and never miss a beat.


..

35679603 Mine worked fairly well for a few months, then performance began to degrade. I must remain within 4-6 feet of my iPhone4 and must have nothing interrupting the line-of-sight between phone and Jawbone Icon, else it generates static and garbled transmissions for the listener. I can not even turn my head such that the jawbone is in my ear opposite the phone. I have spent hours trying to make it perform well, including Jawbone Support, with resets, software updates, and so forth. Now I am trying to locate a charger cable for my original Jawbone from years ago, which even taped and glued together was always better than this Icon HD.
I've learned to live with the difficulty of having it fit well. It's okay, but I was spoiled by the easy and comfortable fit of my Motorola Elite (which fell in the marina as I leapt from my boat).

..

35679603 Best feature is the noise cancelation and small size. The rest is acceptable but could be improved.
I had a Plantronics M50 that I really liked before I purchased this. The things I like about the Plantronics over the Icon was the fit and battery life. Plain and simple, battery life is too short. I need to re-charge every 2 to 3 days. Need something that I can charge on the weekends and know that it will be there for me to use all week. For HD sound, it is just OK, not great. Noise cancelation seems to work great (a big feature for me). I get less complaints from callers when I am in the car or on a job site.
With all the different options for ear plugs, you would think that the fit would be great. But the best fit (I used the loop rubber piece) still hurts a little and sometimes feels like it will fall out, but it never has.

..

35679603 I only purchased this because I lost my tried and true Plantronics Marque headset that I owned for over 2 years with 2 different HTC phones. I really wanted to like the Jawbone because the voice quality was nice on both ends. People I called said I sounded nice and clear. The main issue is that for some reason the Jawbone would randomly disconnect from my HTC smartphone. When I turned the Jawbone on it would indicate that it was connect but I never knew when it really was. Sometimes I would hear a signal indication that it disconnected sometimes not. I wouldn't know for sure if it was connect until someone called me or I attempted to make a call. Sometimes it would disconnect and reconnect again in a couple of seconds. Another big issue with me is the voice dialing. When I attempted to make a call using a persons name it would call someone else who's name is not even close to the one requested. Also the power button is on the side facing your face, meaning you have to take it off to power it off or on. I'm going to return it and buy the latest version of the Plantronics Marque.

..

35679603 I would like to give Jawbone another try but the ear buds really heart my ears. If the ear ear buds don't heart your ears then the right one for you.

..

35679603 This is by far the best bluetooth I have ever had. Sound quality is great, battery life is great, easy to connect to my Android, easy to update the bluetooth with Jawbone's website. Overall I'm thoroughly satisfied with this item. It was a gift and I am thoroughly happy with it.

..

35679603 Works very well with iPhone 5, even Siri. Sound quality great, limited echo. Once I determined the earpiece that best fit my ear it is a comfortable and reliable fit. Hasn't ever fallen out. Bit expensive, but I have tried cheaper ones and they all failed miserably.

..

35679603 I researched bluetooth earpieces for quite some time and decided to give this on a try based upon previous positive experience with Jawbone products. I was really impressed by the demo on the Jawbone website as well as its device compatibility and size. Using the earpiece however turned out to be a big disappointment. It took several tries before I finally got the right combination of adapters together to get it to stay in my ear. I was really disappointed by the extremely poor performance of the so called "Noise Assassin" technology. It produced echoes, or was tinny. 90% of the people I spoke to with it complained about not really being able to hear me. More often than not, I found myself turning it off and holding the phone. Very expensive for the performance - Overrated product.

..

35679603 I travel frequently, and use the Jawbone ICON extensively. With up to 6 hours of talk time, it has never run out of battery life while I have been using it. It recharges quickly, and is ready to go again. The fit is very comfortable. I forget I am wearing it sometimes. I have used other Blue Tooth headsets in the past, and often people have had a hard time understanding me. Not with the ICON. My voice is clear and easily understandable to everyone I talk to. I very highly recommend the Jambox ICON to all.

..

35679603 It would not stay in my ear with or without the ear pieces. I have weird ears I guess you could say. It was just me. Some may like it, I just didn't. I did like the size of the unit though. Wasn't intrusive to wear. Doesn't feel like you have a "hey look at me I have a bluetooth headset on" billboard hanging from your ear.

..

35679603 If you don't mind having everyone hear an echo of themselves then this is the headset for you. The only way to resolve this issue is to turn the volume down. When it's low enough to remove the echo you can't hear the person you're talking to. Bad design, bad buy.

..

35679603 This box is great for us budget minded types. The box arrived in good shape despite the packaging. Stapling a cardboard box to the product does NOT protect it from shipping companies. This product is 5 star for price but 4 star for potential damage and return issues. Fit is very good, back seat still able to fold down, only real complaint is the bracing that splits the box into 2 halves, with separate terminals. With a mono amp I had to run my parallel wiring outside of the box, would have preferred to keep that wiring protected in the box. Otherwise good looking functional product.

Enhance your productivity with this Kaser YF810-8G desktop that features built-in wireless networking, so you can easily browse the Web, access e-mail and more. The HDMI output lets you connect a variety of peripherals.


..

35679603 This device is absolutely slow and awful. The other review was right on the dot.
First off, ANDROID IS NOT READY FOR HOME PC USE! There is no getting around it. Windows, Mac or Linux is REQUIRED for your needs. The only good thing about this, is internet browsing, and even then, you are using an AWFUL mobile phone browser. Have an Android Phone? You basically have this device already.
For $100, you can buy the Ouya and blutooth a keyboard and mouse to it and get better performance surfing the web than this disaster. Yes, granted, the Ouya is a GAME CONSOLE, but it can be hooked to a monitor with the right adapter and be used as a mini PC, and it provides MUCH better performance.
Avoid this. If the developer would up the ram to 1GB and invest in possibly Ubuntu LInux, this could have been great. But 500MB ram and Android does NOT mix for a home computer.

..

35679603 The device is super slow and the response time is incredibly high. HD output is not up to the mark. A number of apps does not run on the ICS version.
Beware: Bestbuy *will not* take care of the product if its bad. And Kaser's customer service is really bad. I have a faulty keyboard. I have not receives the replacement for 3 months.

..

35679603 This computer is a complete Internet surfing computer. It works - but slow to change sites. Still a good buy if all you want to do is surf the Internet. It also works with wireless keyboard and mouse. Enough USB ports to use flash drives. It's got an Android operating system and uses a version of Chrome. I was not able to get a real clear picture on the monitor, but that might be the monitor. Still for a sub-$100 computer, this was pretty good. There is no fan so if you need an Internet computer that is super quiet, this one is the only one I've used that does not make a sound. The system uses added speakers, not a part of the package, or headphones.

..

35679603 I would have given it 5 stars but the AC unit arrived damaged but Best Buy gave a $75 credit so I kept it after testing it to make sure it worked properly. This same unit is the same price at walmart.com but since I bought it while it was on sale I got it a better deal from BB! So far so good, cools my living and dining room area very fast!

..

35679603 As soon as I bought and installed it, no cold air blew. It was working like a fan in all modes. When i opened to came with minor cosmetic damages. A best buy employee said that was the second defective returned of the same model.

..

35679603 With the heat wave I am sooo glad I purchased this AC this Memorial Day.
It has been in almost constant use for a couple weeks. It was easy to instal and the directions were well written. It has a two year warrenty to boot. Great value for the money.

35679603 Not much to say other than installed easily and worked right off, compared to some cheaper brands you see reviews saying that had to go through a few sticks before they got one that worked.

..

35679603 I bought four of the 4Gb modules to upgrade my iMac 21.5 All-In-One computer to it's maximum capacity of 16Gb.

35679603 I'm a firm believer in Best Buy...The customer service is awesome

..

35679603 you got to give it to ups , they are notorious for damaging heavy items , but the box was not too damaged to have a major fan support member (plastic) to be broken . and also when you have an ac unit made to be out in heat and direct sunlight all year round including very cold conditions , plastic is not a good choice because it becomes very brittle. I think this particular ac unit is cheaply built.

..

35679603 The air conditioner arriverd very quickly, however it took an unusually long time to assemble and install, then the side baffels wouldn't fit into the window. After rigging the whole thing to fit, I turned it on and it banged around like a brick in a washing machine. So I had to remove the entire unit so I could open it up and discovered that the fan is mounted with plastic clips. All of the clips broke off (apparently during shipping) and the fan spins wild inside the unit. I managed to screw the fan back into place, then re-install the AC, then it operated fine. Just very upset that 100% new out of the box and I have to repair it to get it to work.

35679603 We purchased this air conditioner for a 500 sq foot office. We were looking for a quiet unit that was sleeved (building requirements for installation) and kept the room cool. After all of the research I did, I took my chances with this one, and its been maybe 2 months and its great. Keeps the room cool and not noisy at all. I mean any unit will be somewhat noisy, but it has a smooth low hum that isn't distracting to the workers. Only thing is... it takes us a few times of clicking the remote button to turn the unit on or off. But that just might be because its installed on the higher part of a window where its hard to get the remote signal. Other than that, great buy!

..

35679603 the price from Best by was under what seen it anywhere and I love Lg appliances the color is a bright white not off white like other brands i LOVE BRIGHT COLORS NEEDED 2 LIFT MY SELF UP FROM THE STRAINS OF LIFE

..

35679603 Please note my review is based on the fact this was broken when I took it out of the box. Very heavy. Couldn't remove the AC unit from the housing for an easy install. Once I did get it installed, the blower fan was loose and it sounded like a B-29 bomber getting ready for takeoff. Put in a service request with LG and got no response. Thanks to Best Buy for a hassle free return.

..

35679603 The LG 12,000 btu air conditioner was purchased to replace an aging 10,000 btu unit of another brand. The LG unit was similar to install as others that I have had, no better, no worse. However, the LG unit is not very rugged, and actually is somewhat lacking in overall quality. I actually had to get two LG units. The first one was badly damaged upon arrival, sent back, and ordered another unit. The LG unit has good controls and features, but I was very disappointed when I turned it on. It blows lots of air, but it is only moderately cool. The 12 year old unit that I was retiring had just as good of cooling as this new LG. If you want a good fan with nice controls buy the LG. IF you want a unit that will actually cool then look elsewhere.

..

35679603 I had a Kenmore Plasmair before this one...both made by same company.
1. The new unit works as expected but
1a: remote has no LED like Kenmore
1b. remote reception is terrible. You have to be right in front of it for it to work; the Kenmore was amazing in comparison
2. it is not quiet compared to Kenmore.

..

35679603 The manual is totally confusing with skimpy descriptions and cartoon like drawings. After installation, I noticed it doesnt drip(only if overflows). Cust. service said ther is a fan which blows the water in the pan out instead of having a hole for draining.If dirt or dust gets in the pan, it will sit there. In addition it is supported on a window frame with 2 bolts which can be adjusted for height so you have the right angle. It is insufficient support especially if you dont have a very wide window sill on the outside. Friedrich has a better bracket support. Also lacking a readout of actual temperature in the room Only temperature it displays is the temperature you wish it to be. GE has this feature which I think is essential.I should have gotten the exact model Consumer Reports recommended.

..

35679603 I bought this A/C mostly because it had a slide in chassis, and was well reviewed by a major consumer testing organization. The unit was shipped UPS, and looked like it had a really hard ride getting to me. Foam packing material inside was broken into pieces, so I expected the worst. Amazingly, the A/C itself was intact, so I proceeded to test it out prior to install. When I turned it on, the fan made a horrible sound, like it was hitting something. I quickly turned it off, and figured out that the fan was indeed hitting the shroud. I re-positioned the fan and tightened it up,. I also tightened every other screw I could find- several were quite loose. I put it in the window, and it worked fine. Then, when I went to put on the front grille, I found there was no place in the grille for the vent knob to come through. I called LG, and was told I had the wrong grille, and they would send another. I never got the replacement grille. LG really needs to work on quality control and Customer Service. The unit itself Cools well, and is not too noisy for a 12K A/C. The fan is quite powerful, but the slowest speed is too fast, so it is not as quiet as it might be if the slow speed were slower.

..

35679603 AFTER READING MANY POSITIVE REVIEWS AND CONSUMER REPORTS, I DECIDED TO PURCHASE THIS AIR CONDITIONER. I HAD IT SHIPPED TO THE STORE FOR PICKUP BECAUSE I DIDNT WANT UPS SHIPPING IT. THEY ARE RUFF ON THEIR PACKAGES AND IT DIDNT WANT THE AIR CONDITIONER TO ARRIVE DAMAGED. I HAVE AN EASY AND PLEASANT PICK UP EXPERIENCE AT MY LOCAL BEST BUY STORE. WHEN I GOT HOME, I OPENED THE BOX TO FIND 4 LOOSE BLACK SCREWS. THERE WAS PLASTIC FILLING THE THREADS OF ALL 4 SCREWS. ONCE IN THE WINDOW AND PLUGGED IN, I TURNED THE UNIT ON TO DISCOVER THAT THE FAN WAS NOT WORKING. I KNEW THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG AND THAT I NEEDED TO TURN THE UNIT OFF. I SLID THE CHASIE OUT OF THE FRAME TO FIND THAT THE FAN ASSEMBLY IN FRONT OF THE CONDENSER WAS NOT ATTACHED AND THAT THE FAN MOTOR WAS VERY HOT. I TRIED TO MANUALLY SPIN THE FAN AND IT WOULD NOT TURN. REMEMBER THESE 4 SCREWS? YEP, THEY WERE THE SCREWS THAT HELD THE FAN SHROUD ASSEMBLY TO THE UNIT. ALL 4 SCREW HOLES WERE STRIPPED AND WOULD NO LONGER HOLD THE FAN IN PLACE. EVERYTHING IS PLASTIC HERE. I SEARCHED IN MY SHOP AND FOUND 4 LARGER SCREWS THE SAME LENGTH, JUST A LITTLE BIT LARGER IN DIAMETER. I RE-ATTACHED THE FAN ASSEMBLY AND MY 4 NEW SCREWS SO FAR HAVE DONE THE TRICK VERY NICELY. I CALLED LG SUPPORT TO TELL THEM I WANTED A REPLACEMENT EVEN THOUGH THE UNIT WAS NOW OPERATING PROPERLY AND THEY STATED THAT THE ONLY THING THAT THEY COULD DO WAS TO SEND A TECH OUT TO REPAIR THE AIR CONDITIONER AND BECAUSE I LIVED BEYOND THE ACCEPTABLE SERVICE AREA LIMITATION THAT SHE WOULD HAVE TO CALL ME BACK WITH AN APPOINTMENT LATER IN THE WEEK. IF I WANTED TO REPLACE THE UNIT I WOULD HAVE TAKE IT BACK TO THE STORE. WELL SINCE I LIVED 45 MINUTES FROM THE STORE I DECIDED TO KEEP THE UNIT. WE HAVE BEEN USING THE AIR CONDITIONER NOW FOR ABOUT 1 MONTH AND I MUST SAY THAT IT IS VERY QUIET AND COOLS MY LIVING SPACE VERY WELL. I AM HOWEVER DISPLEASED WITH THE BUILD QUALITY OF THE APPLIANCE. BUY AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION!

..

35679603 This unit works great cools my room off quickly and isn't that loud for a unit this large. It is a very heavy unit though. It took me a little while to install it and I needed to get a hand to slide the unit into the window. But all in all it is a great product.

Immerse yourself in your favorite tunes with these Fanny Wang WangBuds high-definition earbud headphones that feature large air chambers to create deep, booming bass while producing clear mids and highs. The silicon tips provide a snug, secure fit.


..

6006839200003 They are a great pair of headphones, but the ear pieces where strange to fit into my ear. The small was too small and the big was too big, while the medium was a really weird fit. I liked the look of them, the style, and the price, but I didn't really hear the high definition they were talking about. I own a pair of Beat Solo HD headphones and they sound great.

6006839200003 I love Gumdrop cases and have purchased a total of 7 to protect my families iPads! My new ipad dropped for the exercise bike hit the corner and it was still perfect!!! Very protective!
The only issue with their new hideaway model and the ONLY reason I gave it 4 stars - is that the home button is no longer a nice rubber button, it has the screen protector over it. This makes it difficult to push - my 4 year old nephew can not push it.
Other then that I would recommend gumdrop over any other case any day!

6006839200003 Bought this cover for our child it works great on her iPad

..

6006839200003 Perfect protection for my 6 year old's iPad 2. We use it with out the detachable screen protector which is a nice option since we already have one of those Zagg screen protectors for scratches. We were more concerned about drop protection and durability. The shell is like having a performance tire wrapped around your device. It covers all the ports extremely well and has been dropped numerous times on hardwood floor with no issues. Highly recommend this cover.

..

6006839200003 I've gone through 4 shields before this but because my children have dropped the ipad enough times, I really needed the extra protection. Would love if this weighed less and came in different colors. Although they offer a black color on this case, it is not at same performance level, military v regular. Would have just preferred a simple black in the military grade.

..

6006839200003 I bought this because my iPads original case which was a Griffin Defender series had finally taken enough of a beating and was falling apart. Those are almost $80. I found this cheaper alternative and so far it's holding up to what the other case did. The only thing I did not like between the 2 is that the Griffin case had a plastic protective casing around the entire Ipad before the Grip slip cover went over it. This case only has plastic over the front but it doesn't seem to have affected its ability to protect. I would recommend this case to anyone with children or using outside.

..

6006839200003 The case for our ipad is very sturdy and durable. It gives us peace of mind that our ipad is protected as our children are playing with it...

..

6006839200003 I've really enjoyed this case. It really makes me feel that my iPad is protected. Yes, like any of the protective cases, it is a bit bulky, but that is what it is for. I liked the looks of this case better than the OtterBox and the Griffin Survivor (the main other cases I was looking at) and it was cheaper. There have been some complaints in other reviews about the built in screen protector and if I really look very close there may be a very slight distortion with it, but truthfully I do not really notice it and I am generally pretty picky about things like this. All in all, I really have no complaints about this case.

..

6006839200003 I've had it for nearly a year. No problems at all. It's a little difficult to get on and off but that's because it protects so well. You don't need to take it on and off. I cart my Ipad everywhere in the house and underneath the Ipad is like the day I bought it.

..

6006839200003 If you are looking to kid-proof your iPad2, this is the case for you. Superb all around protection from drops, spills, and greasy fingers.

..

6006839200003 I bought this case to save my iPad from breaking when the kids use it. I do not use the plastic cover that came with the Gumdrop case on front so I can not review that part of the case. I use a ZAGG shield for the screen.
The Gumdrop covers the whole iPad and even when dropped from Kid level protects the iPad just fine. If you have kids and they use your iPad, get this case. Its is worth the price and piece of mind.
The drawbacks are that the case is bulky and there is NO kickstand which really is an oversite. It is very easy to hold on and slip resistant so it is harder to drop (which is the point)
I recommend this product for people on the go with their iPads, parents with kids that use their iPads, or if you use your iPad out doors quite bit.

6006839200003 I've really enjoyed this case. It really makes me feel that my iPad is protected. Yes, like any of the protective cases, it is a bit bulky, but that is what it is for. I liked the looks of this case better than the OtterBox and the Griffin Survivor (the main other cases I was looking at) and it was cheaper. There have been some complaints in other reviews about the built in screen protector and if I really look very close there may be a very slight distortion with it, but truthfully I do not really notice it and I am generally pretty picky about things like this. All in all, I really have no complaints about this case.

..

6006839200003 I've had it for nearly a year. No problems at all. It's a little difficult to get on and off but that's because it protects so well. You don't need to take it on and off. I cart my Ipad everywhere in the house and underneath the Ipad is like the day I bought it.

..

6006839200003 If you are looking to kid-proof your iPad2, this is the case for you. Superb all around protection from drops, spills, and greasy fingers.

..

6006839200003 I bought this case to save my iPad from breaking when the kids use it. I do not use the plastic cover that came with the Gumdrop case on front so I can not review that part of the case. I use a ZAGG shield for the screen.
The Gumdrop covers the whole iPad and even when dropped from Kid level protects the iPad just fine. If you have kids and they use your iPad, get this case. Its is worth the price and piece of mind.
The drawbacks are that the case is bulky and there is NO kickstand which really is an oversite. It is very easy to hold on and slip resistant so it is harder to drop (which is the point)
I recommend this product for people on the go with their iPads, parents with kids that use their iPads, or if you use your iPad out doors quite bit.

This Gumdrop Cases Drop Tech Series DS5G-BLK case features a multilayer design with built-in screen and port covers and reinforced rubber corner bumpers that absorb shock to help keep your Apple iPhone 5 safe from impact damage.


..

6006839200003 I'm a butterfingers and needed a case that wouldn't be slippery. I already have a Gumdrop on my iPad and love it. The ribbing on the back makes it almost impossible to drop. And if dropped, my beautiful iPhone has a great chance of surviving intact. Thick corner bumpers give super protection.
Other reviewers say you can't remove the front screen shield but I popped it out without much trouble. Was not cemented in but rather held in with something sticky. I could put it back if I want but I don't like the slight change a screen protector causes. I know this makes the protection incomplete but so be it.

..

6006839200003 **UPDATE**CHECK OUT THE VIDEO**
After using this case for a couple of days, all I can say is it sucks when you need to make a call. If you want to place the call on speaker, good luck. If you want to use the keypad or mute the call, good luck. Any phone call function is impossible to perform while a call is active. When you press one of these buttons, the button highlights, but doesn't do anything The phone is totally confused by the screen protector. To end phone calls, you sometimes have to use the power button on the top. Renders the case useless. Got an Otter-box and I don't have this problem now. CHECK OUT THE VIDEO, IT SAYS IT ALL!

..

6006839200003 I picked this case up on sale from BB for $28. Very good price compared to the Otterbox for $50. This case is thinner than the Otterbox and therefore not as bulky. Lighter too. The ridges on the back make it easy to hold while the built in screen protector is great because it's nearly invisible and doesn't show hardly any greasy residue; touch feedback is not effected either. The power and home buttons have very good feedback, as well as the volume buttons. Very stylish and looks great for the black 5. Get this case!

..

6006839200003 I luv this case, I wish they would make this brand of case for the Ipad. You definitely get way more quality than you paid for.

..

6006839200003 very easy to put on, has a clear protector included, also good for when kids use it and drop it.

..

6006839200003 Decent case but I would recommend going with the OtterBox instead.. I have both cases but the OtterBox is 10 times better worth spending a little more money

..

6006839200003 Does what it's supposed to do. A bit Chunk.
**Galaxy Tab 10.1 and Galaxy Note 10.1 are not the same item. Totally different tablet. That's why it doesn't fit.

..

6006839200003 Website indicated that this was the case I needed for ASUS Memo pad 10" but did not fit.

..

6006839200003 It has been on my E Pad since it was received. Wouldn't be without it.

..

6006839200003 This E-Pad case is very durable and nice looking. My son loves it. Before we bought this he would constantly take his epad out of the old vinyl case to play with it and broke two of them. Now it is no longer necessary for him to do that anymore and its been holding up just great!

..

6006839200003 Grip is outstanding&control is well needed. I am happy with my purchase. A bit pricey? I have more confidence when holding. Don't want to take gumdrop off my device.

..

6006839200003 This product was said the fit my note, and best buy advertises it with the note, but this does NOT FIT around the note, its really close, but this isint horse shoes or handgrenades - it is going back ASAP! if you have a TAB , I am sure you will enjoy this product.

..

6006839200003 Best buy says it fits Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1
It does not. Now I have a $50 chunk of plastic in colors that I did not want to begin with.

..

6006839200003 It fits my Macbook Air 13 " like a glove. It looks great. I got it because I wanted it to buffer the sharpish edges of my machine, and it does just that. I got it in red and the color makes me very happy. Very much as advertised.

..

6006839200003 I purchased the IPad 2 as a gift for my wife. She is very active with her
IPad2 but was afraid she would drop and damage it severely. Once
she put the IPad in her case, her fears are almost gone. She's not
worried about scratches or drops. A great security blanket for her and her new playmate.

..

6006839200003 I bought this case on June 1st and returned it a month later because it was starting to peel offl on the inside. Nothing rubs against it, it just started to separate. The case looks really nice and has a soft feel. However, I would not recommend it if you're also looking to protect it. It does cover the corners which is one of my main concerns protecting a $600 investment.

..

6006839200003 It's been a little over a month since I started using this case on my IPad, and it's already getting dirty and some parts are falling apart. So, quality is not so great. It only gives you one folding position, which sometomes is not enough. However, the color is outstanding and it's a great eye-catcher. Great for short-term use, not a great long-term investment.

This Hard Candy Cases ShockDrop case provides reliable protection for your Apple iPhone 5, with a silicone and polycarbonate construction for shock absorption, rip-resistant port covers and a semirigid screen protector to safeguard your phone's display.


..

6006839200003 I just got my iPhone 5 earlier this week & had ordered this case earlier to make sure I had protection for the phone as soon as I got it. I used the case for most of the day & suddenly my phone wouldn't let me end calls. It was impossible to get the home button to function & then I couldn't get it to respond when I would touch the green area to return to a call at the top of the screen. I had another brand of case & tried that & the phone functions perfectly. Today I saw the review on Bestbuy.com on the similar case from Gumdrop ( a sister company of Hard Candy) that has a video of a defect in that case that's exactly what I experienced. The Gumdrop case is virtually the same design as this one, by the way. Maybe this doesn't happen with every Shockdrop case like this but I wouldn't buy this one or the other until they fix this defect. It's too bad because the case was really well constructed & the fit around the phone was fantastic.

This Hard Candy Cases Shockdrop ruggedized case features durable polycarbonate and silicone materials that offer 4-corner protection to keep your Apple iPad mini safe from bumps and drops. The semirigid screen protector helps guard against scratches.


..

6006839200003 Even though it is a great cover, we had to take it back since it would not charge on the alarm clock without taking the cover off. If you are not using a clock charger, it is a good choice. This is true for most of the covers

This skin features shock-resistant, form-fitting TPU material to keep your Apple iPad 2 protected. The play-through design allows access to audio outputs, dock connectors, the multitouch display and controls for easy use.


..

6006839200003 This case seems to protect the iPad2 well, but it is a pain in the neck to get on. It is flat so there is no easel function, if that matters to you. Two benefits of this product are that it stays on and even though it is closed you can see reminders, etc. on screen when it lights up. Also, all the buttons are really easy to reach and the speaker is exposed enough to get good sound.
Not for someone who wants something fashionable or professional looking.

..

35477562 This is certainly a very powerful piece of software, and it will allow users to create any genre of music they would like.
The thing is however that it's very expensive. There are similar products in the 'DAW Market' that will offer you just as much and even MORE tools/possibilities for under half the price!

..

35477562 Sure you can get this and you will like it, However, you can Get Adobe Audition for less and it does twice as much and is more user friendly. Same goes for Cuebase. however, the sony product is good... but you wont be as productive with it as you would with other programs out there.

Your first view of the RIOT Series may deceive you. The elegant lines are a textbook exercise in minimalist design. From this point on, however, its power and reproductive authenticities will be anything but minimal. Perhaps the only thing more extensive than the features showcased is the enjoyment you'll derive from them. This is only one reason BOSS Audio has led the way in 12 Volt Entertainment for almost a quarter of a Century.


..

35477562 My only "complaint" is it would be cool if the lite logo would rotate. Due to wire concerns I had to bring the power wire into the left side of the trunk, and mount the amp, so the logo is upside down.
Also, the level control, has little or no effect. It's kinda a "oh shoot" type of button... no real effect.
Have it pushing 2 10" subs... it will easily blow me out of the car.

35477562 I got this phone for my home office. It has every feature I want, but unfortunately I've been unable to use it. Despite the filters I have on my lines, I can still hear a LOT of DSL noise in the line, to the point that I can't hear the person on the other end. I can only assume that's a testament to how sensitive the audio is on this phone. :-) I don't have this problem with my filters and my old cheap phones. Hoping to find a solution to this problem someday.

35477562 This is a great phone I have been looking for over a year for a speaker phone that really works. The speaker function on this phone is great the speaker is very clear. The price of the phone was very inexpensive for all the features you get. The only thing that I don't like about this phone is even though it came with a power cord it still needs 3 AA battery for th screen to light up. But I can deal with that. Wonder phone. I am very pleased.

35477562 Good if you want the ease of having something in the office and remind you to do it. I do about half of my cards with this and the other half I'll do at or coming out of meetings on free apps like cardsquash. Cardmunch is good, but I don't like the hooks into linkedin.

..

35477562 easy to set up. works great with outlook. organizes the information. scans jpeg of front and back.

..

35477562 I used this machine about 1x a year for five years. It was great - clear pictures, accurate extraction of data with very little need for manual corrections. It is true, they had a cloud service and got rid of it. Given that the machine is super expensive, the cloud service should have remained. It does not have a duplex function, but the software will scan a second side of a business card if you scan the second side. The software will insert both sides of the card in one file - its a 2-step process. After only about 5 uses over 5 years (scanning in batch jobs), my unit died. I thought about buying another but I could not justify buying a new machine after the first one did not last very long. After a little research, I am looking at a droid software that offers cloud service, without having to own a scanner - CamCard. I like the idea of being able to "scan" with my camera instead of a portable scanner.

..

35477562 Dymo has recently ABANDONED it's "cloud service" feature which allowed you to sync all your work and home devices via their website. While that service was excellent, and while they certainly could have charged for it, they elected to stop the service.
For what's left, the price is high; the scanner is not duplex; the scanner only does small cards.
Don't waste your money.

Protect your FUJIFILM digital camera with this bag that features faux crocodile material for guarding against dust and scratches and a bowler design for a stylish look.


..

35477562 I love this camera bag! My fugi instax camera fits perfectly inside along with extra film and batteries. It's a stylish bag and the color and texture are great!

..

35477562 At the very end of 2010, a couple days before Christmas to be exact I purchased the Fuji fine pix S4080 and wanted a good size bag with enough protective padding. This one was great and it double as a purse for quite a while. I've had several cameras and various bags and this one is my favorite. The Fuji Fine Pix S4080 is the same size as the newer 4500 model and will take up half the interior of the bag. With the movable padded divider you will have enough space on the other half to fit wires, spare batteries and wallet to hold cards and cell phone. As I said, the padded divider is movable to acomidate a smaller or larger camera. To sum it up, I love it because my camera is well protected and Its size and style suit my needs because it illiminates the need to carry an additional bag.

..

35477562 If you really want blue, do not order this bag. It is so dark it looks black. There is no black choice with white handles, so I know I received the correct item. Bag seems fine and is something different for the ladies. As long as it keeps the camera clean and safe I am okay with it.

I've never had such bad results with any other brand of blank DVDs. Total C***.

35477562 I Think this is a very great buy! it's not too expensive and the transfer is a really great add on.

..

35477562 We purchased the "Grace Digital - Victoria Tunewriter III USB Recordable Turntable" in Oak after a long search. It was a Christmas present for my mother-in-law who loves her CDs and LP's. Unfortunately the darn thing stopped playing CDs after about 3 weeks. So we called Best Buy and they said, sorry, you've only got 15 days to make a return. So we called the 800-number and got the same story. We requested to talk to a manager and that call was never returned. Bottom line, don't buy this unit and make sure you understand the return policy before you make your purchase .... anywhere. Completely unsatisfied!

35477562 Albums play so so. 45's sound wavy like. CD's slide off the tray. I bought a brand new CD and it got stuck inside when it slide off the tray. I had to push the button 3 times to open/close in order to get the CD out and it came out all scratched. It is very poorly constructed and it doesn't work very well. It is basically a piece of junk. I returned it to BestBuy and bought a different brand unit for almost 1/2 the price and it works so much better. The CD's don't slide around on the tray and all the records play good.

Survivor Skin is extra-thick silicone cladding that wraps protectively around your iPod, yet is slim enough in profile to fit easily in and out of your pocket. Survivor Skin's durable silicone protects the back, sides and edges of your iPod from impacts and vibration. The smooth, matte textured exterior is easy to grip, and custom molded for a precise fit. A molded interior provides extra shock absorption. Edge cutouts provide access to controls, headphone jack and dock connector, and raised button covers keep grit and moisture away from buttons and controls. Front and back camera ports keep your iPod ready for action. How protective is Survivor Skin? An independent testing agency applied standards for impact resistance due to drops set by the U.S. Department of Defense (MIL-STD-810G) and tested Survivor Skin for Shock/Drop and Vibration. They gave its silicone and savvy engineering tougher tests than you will ever subject it to. It performed. Spectacularly. The Tests: Shock/Drop: An independent testing agency repeatedly dropped a Survivor Skin-clad iPod onto a concrete floor from a height of 6 ft. (That's higher than you will ever drop it from while standing.) Vibration: The test subjected Survivor Skin and iPod to 18 hrs of bone-shaking vibration, from 20 to 2000 cycles per second. (Imagine leaving your iPod on the floor of your car all day while you negotiate under-construction roads at top speed.)

35477562 Really liked this cover. Selected it because my son has gone through three different iTouch covers and the plastic ones black and the gorilla ones are hard to press the surface with my large fingers. This one does the job!

..

35477562 I just need something to cover my device. It offers everything I need in a cover for and easily screen cracking device. So far I have sat it in my lap in the car and forgot went to step out and it fell and my device in still in tact.

..

35477562 Bought it for my son, it def protects the iPod which I love, however it doesn't fit perfectly.

Enhanced protection where and when you need it.Survivor Slim gives you and your iPhone protection enough to pass military-standard tests, yet it's slim enough to go with you everywhere.We paired a super-protective polycarbonate shell with tough, resilient silicone. We added a touch-through protective film for your touchscreen, and silicone covers for the controls and Home button. The result is Survivor Slim: full-time shock/drop/vibration protection for your iPhone that you never have to think about, in a slim, pocketable profile.

A great choice for juicing whole foods, this wide-mouth juice extractor has a powerful 800-watt motor and removable parts that are dishwasher safe for easy cleaning. This easy-to-assemble juice extractor comes with a stainless-steel strainer basket with cleaning brush for easy pulp removal.


..

35477562 I was just looking for a basic juicer and this one fits the bill. It comes apart easily for cleaning, however the filter is somewhat difficult to clean. It has been great so far.

..

35477562 TRYING THIS AND WORKS FINE. OF COURSE YOU DONT WANT TO STUFF EVERYTHING THAT'S BIG AND DONT FORCE IT SO IT DOESNT BREAK!

..

35477562 I was looking for an inexpensive juicer since did I want to invest in a more expensive one. Pulls juice of out fruits and veggies easily and to the max. The pulp that remains is dryer than that of other juicers I've tried. Easy to set up and easy to clean. I have recommended to several friends.

..

35477562 Xcellent product for the price,only complaint is i don't fell like I get most of the juice out of certain things like fruit but for the value it's a great juicer!!!

..

35477562 I wanted to start off small for my first juicer and after reading all of its reviews, I decided to go with this one. Everything was great until it stopped working a few weeks after I purchased it. I'm guessing it was the motor that went. I didn't want to buy another one, I upgraded to the Breville juicer( the one in the Joe Cross documentary-fat, sick and nearly dead) and I haven't had any issues thus far.

..

35477562 We bought this 2 months ago, and still have a blast making new juices and coming up with new recipes! This thing rocks

..

35477562 I love my juicer, it works great and cleans up easy.

..

35477562 This juicer is very easy to use and assemble. I love it!

..

35477562 I have made many different types of juice! Great flavor!

..

35477562 Great product for the price. Very well satisfied except that it is bulkier than we thought.

Serve delicious cups of coffee to your guests with this Hamilton Beach BrewStation 47950 coffeemaker that features a carafe-free design and 1-handed dispensing for simple use. The warming heater maintains your coffee's temperature for optimal flavor.


..

35477562 This is our third Hamilton Beach Coffee Maker. We love the no carafe design. The old one was working fine, but slow, and we had let it get pretty gunked up, so decided that at the $40 price we could make the purchase of a new one. We especially like the container that you fill with water and then just "plug" in to the unit. That was my only complaint on the old model - too many spills and a narrow slot to pour water in. The new coffee maker has solved this problem and still has the other features we loved on the old one.

..

35477562 I am very satisfied with this coffee maker, it is easy to operate and makes good coffee. It is pleasant to the eyes . I am dissapointed that I cannot clean the internal parts, filter basket and coffee chamber in the Dishwasher, but it is still a good unit for my purposes.

..

35477562 The settings are easy to do. The lift off and fill tank are great and easy to put on and off. I like the flat bottom filters. Easy to fill. The dispenser makes it fast and easy to get that first cup in the morning. No mess!

..

35477562 Easy to fill the water container; easy to fill your cup with no glass carafe to break; keeps coffee hot (you can program it to stay warm up to 4 hours).
We love it soooo much we bought a second one to have as a backup just in case something happens to it. Usually when I find a product I love and I have to replace it, it' slither been modified or discontinued. Didn't want to risk that with this great coffee pot!

..

35477562 Will not last long. Cheap plastic. Took 10 loads to get the plastic taste out.
Side fill is very good feature.
I would pay a lot more for a complete unit made out of stainless steel!
Design is very good!

..

35477562 Great coffeemaker. Easy to use and looks good on the counter. Sleek design.

..

35477562 This is a great coffee pot for the price. No worries of a carafe, just fill your cup and go.

..

35477562 THIS IS A GREAT COFFEE POT- I BOUGHT THE EARLIER VERSION AND USED IT TIL I BROKE THE HINGE OFF THE LID- I WAS REALLY GLAD TO SEE THERE WAS A NEWER VERSION THAT IS MORE DURABLE AND EVEN EASIER TO USE THAN THE OLD VERSION. NO MORE POTS TO LIFT OUT AND POUR- JUST PLACE YOUR CUP OR LARGE TUMBLER AND AS EASY AS 1-2-3 COFFEE IS IN IT WITHOUT ANY MESS!!

..

35477562 No pot to clean or burn. Makes good coffee. Like the removable water tank. Coffee could be a little hotter, but overall happy.

..

35477562 Easy to use. I really like the water reservoir, not too many things to take apart early in the morning. Makes good coffee for price. I mainly bought it for the dispenser, great for grabbing a cup out the door.

Hamilton Beach BrewStation 48463 Coffee Maker - 12 Cup


..

35477562 I have two Brew Stations before and thet are really GREAT!. This does so much more. I can make Iced coffee in it and its very good.

..

35477562 We needed something that could replace our old coffee maker, but was similar to it. This machine was an upgrade from our old Hamilton Beach BrewStation, which started leaking towards the end, but still works. This new one is much better, but it's hard to tell if this one would leak after a few years. Otherwise, if you're a big coffee drinker and don't use the k-cup machines, I suggest this machine for your home or even office.

..

35477562 Replaced an earlier model that wasn't heating as well therefore coffee wasn't as good. This newer model performs and brews well.

..

35477562 ease of making coffee = keeps it hot and is so easy

..

35477562 Great coffee maker for the price there was a deal in store. Was a gift to my parents because their coffee maker broke. At first they did not know how to use it because there was no pot, but once they got used to it they love it! Simple, easy and clean.

..

35477562 I have to have my coffee every weekday morning. This brew station brews an excellent cup of coffee and is easy to set up. I have it on auto-brew so my coffee is ready when I wake up. The removable basket prevents coffee grounds from entering into the unit. I love it.

..

35477562 I love this coffee maker. It keeps the coffee hot and fresh because there is no carafe. Also, having no carafe is one less thing to break or replace! The only negative is that it is very tall, and did not fit in the space I intended to use it.

..

35477562 I needed a new programmable coffee maker to replace a much more expensive Frigidare unit that stopped brewing after a year and a couple of days. After looking at all of them online, I found this one. I liked it because the price was right ($45 or so), it keeps coffee warm (or hot) for up to 4 hours (or more if you reset it), and it's a dispenser rather than a coffee pot.
I mostly don't care about the dispenser part except that the last cup of coffee doesn't get "fried" from sitting in a pot on a burner. The last cup is as good as the first.
One of the best features with this coffee maker is that the coffee basket and the water/coffee container can be removed for easy day-to-day cleaning and for making coffee at counter level.
After cleaning, I put both on the counter, fill the water container to the 12 cup level (12 cups max), then pour the water into the coffee maker at a much lower level than most coffee makers. It's far less awkward this way. Then I put the container back in place to receive the coffee when it's made.
The coffee basket, with a paper filter (a wire mesh filter is available) takes 6 standard scoops for a full 12 cups. It can also be filled at counter level, then placed back in the coffee maker. Unlike other coffee makers, this prevents accidentally dumping coffee into the water reservoir. Yes, I've seen that happen and cleaning it out is a mess.
When the coffee is brewed, it goes into the container that you poured the water into on the counter top, ready to easily dispense.
My only "objection" is that when the coffee is done, there's only one quiet beep that can't easily be heard outside the kitchen. This may be a feature so as not to wake anyone else who's sleeping. Regardless, for regular coffee, it takes 10 minutes to brew. For "Bold" coffee it takes about 15 minutes.
As for durability, I rated the coffee maker as excellent, but I've only had it for a couple of months and nothing has broken yet. Time will tell, I'm sure.

..

35477562 This is a great coffee maker which brews up to 12 cups and holds them until you want a cup. Then it dispenses the coffee one cup or container at a time, then keeps warm up to 4 hours via timer. Very good product!

..

35477562 We had this for 2 weeks and gave it to a friend. You can not reheat coffee and it is hard to fill the top then transfer the water to the lower chamber without spilling. It comes apart in 3 pieces to load water and coffee.

..

Bake, broil and more with this Hamilton Beach 31333 toaster oven that features convection cooking to deliver even heat for ideal results. The 30-minute timer helps you manage time to coordinate an entire meal.


..

35477562 We had a more expensive toaster oven that just died on us and were looking for a more reasonably priced replacement. This one fits our needs and does everything the more expensive model did. With just two of us, I do most of my cooking in the toaster oven so I use it a lot. So far there isn't anything I don't like about it. It does toast and cook hotter than our old toaster oven so I have to get used to using a lower setting, but it's nice because the food cooks quicker.

..

35477562 I love my new convection oven frozen foods/snacks are ready quickly. On late work nites dinner is ready fast and clean up is quick.

..

35477562 This oven does everything it claims it does, the one annoying thing however is that it's rounded in the back to support the 12" pizza you see in the picture online. What you don't see until you take it out of the box is that to accommodate that pizza it's rounded in the back and thus the unit sits a good 4 inches from the wall.

..

35477562 Great toaster oven, the convection feature is pretty nice. I also like the broil options. Has plenty of space to bake stuff. It is kind of bulky from the outside but if you don't like that part just get a smaller toaster oven.
It does take a while to clean. The pull out dip dry is a nice addition but you must really scrub it for a while to get it clean. Other then that great product.

..

35477562 I think this is nice replacement for our 20 year old toaster-oven. It has a much larger capacity and works well as a small oven. The heating elements do not seem to heat up as fast as old toasters so making toast takes longer than it used to.

..

35477562 Great little multi-use space saving appliance. Brushed finished is nice as finger prints don't show. Light weight making it portable if you need to store it in one place and move it to another place for use. I used the convection and baked a 12 inch thin crust pizza and it came out perfect.

..

35477562 This toaster-oven bakes and toasts okay. But the little numbers are very difficult to see. I keep a small flashlight nearby. You have to rescue your toast or unplug it to stop the heat.

..

35477562 Nice little toaster oven that performs multiple baking options. Very clean design and nice to have all stainless steel. Easy to use. Would definitely recommend for a mid-range price toaster. But two kind of annoying things I wasn't aware of: 1) It accommodates a large pizza, but the trade off is the back is not flush to the wall so you loose about 5" of counter space. 2) The timer ticks a little loudly.

..

35477562 After doing some research, I decided to buy this toaster oven. I gave it a quick try right after receiving it, and it doesn't disappoint. Heat up very quickly and cook the food evenly. It also has a convection feature which is a plus.

..

35477562 I'm single and it's great to not have to heat up my big oven,. It fits a Totinos pizza perfectly.

..

Choose from regular, bold and 1-4-cup brew options to personalize your coffee with this Hamilton Beach Ensemble 43253R 12-cup coffeemaker. The large clock display and programmable timer accommodate your busy schedule.


..

35477562 Have bought Black and Decker in the past. The first one lasted a couple years, the last on just over a year. I am trying Hamilton Beach and hopes it lasts longer the my Black and Decker.

..

35477562 I have been looking for kitchen appliances in red for two years. When it was time for me look for a red coffemaker, I looked on the this website for pricing, the reviews, quality, and how well this coffemaker would match my kitchen decor. First, the price was affordable for a RED coffemaker and I received 2X bonus points, a plus. Two, the other reviews were accurate, if you read some of the reviews carefully, some people nitpicked over the smallest things about this coffemaker, but I digress. The coffeemaker keeps my coffee and tea HOT!!! Also, it shuts itself off after two hours which is great because I do forget to turn off my coffeemaker. Finally, after I bought it, everyone loved my coffeemaker!!! Who compliments someone about their coffemaker? Yes, that's how pretty this appliance is!!!

..

35477562 It's a fine coffee maker for the price. Does exactly what it says it does. No problems yet.

..

35477562 Bought this in red to bring some color into the Kitchen. Love the design.

..

35477562 Has the basic features I was looking for like auto shut off and programmable. Clock display is nice and big. I chose Hamilton Beach over Cuisinart because of safety issues reviewers reported. Reasonably priced too.

..

35477562 Finally, a drip coffee maker that has all the right features and functions that all others should have and at very reasonable price. I have owned & used several "big name" & fairly expensive makes (well over $75.00) that weren't this good!
Simple basket/filter arrangement. No more trying to get a basket cover on "just right" so as not to smash the filter down with the resulting grinds getting behind it and into the pot!
I really like the regular and bold brew selection. It makes it easier to compensate for medium and dark roast ground coffee blends w/o the waste!
One big improvement over the many makes I have used for 30+ years is that now I can pour the water in and the coffee out rapidly with out spilling any of either!! That annoyed the heck out of me right up until I bought this one.
My Wife also likes the Red color that matches some of Her kitchen decor. The control buttons are also easy to use & well marked.
I am very well pleased with this coffee maker and with it's long respected, brand name, I'm sure that I will continue to do so for many years to come.
Hamilton Beach has got it right on this one!!

..

35477562 This machine is great dont know why but coffee tastes better in the new one. Old one was only a year old so I cant explain just taste is better.

..

35477562 only thing i don't like is theres no backlight on the clock

..

35477562 I like the coffee maker and it is quicker than Mr. Coffee so u get ur coffee quicker. The downside is I cannot easily see the water level. I have to move it around carefully to view the side. Mostly it is due to my location of the coffee maker so I may want to move it to the opposite side of the kitchen.

..

35477562 I love the coffeemaker! Love the color....love the programmable aspect..I just love the product! I have a very small kitchen and the height of the product poses a problem when adding water and coffee as it has to go under the cabinet. But, other than than, I absolutely LOVE the product!

35477562 This is by far the worst computer program I have ever used. I wouldn't even give a free copy to my worst enemy. It has so many glitches, runs so slowly, and doesn't allow for any user set controls. There are no shortcut keys to allow for quick operation. I have been using this for 3 months now and it doesn't get easier! Actually, the more you try to do the longer it takes to load! It freezer over the tiniest command. There is no way to lock any item on your plan. If you accidentally move or delete an item there is a good chance you will spend another day restoring it. I'm not trying to build anything elaborate. Just a simple one story, L-shaped house with a gable roof. I probably would have bashed my computer in if I were trying to build a 2 story with cathedral ceilings!
If you do decide to give it a whirl my best advice to you is save the program after EVERY move you make with different file names! A restore point would be a great option in the next addition!
I am very skilled at some pretty advanced computer programs and run a fast computer.

..

35477562 I was skeptical at first because people rated it bad, the only reason I could gather from those negative reviews were that the games haven't changed much from earlier versions. However this is the first version I've bought of this game I absolutely love it and plan on buying newer games as they come out.

35477562 Does not miimic the game as real lable play. For instance your bet keeps increase when you lose. Like itto clear all bets when you lose.

..

35477562 This casino game has 35 variations of the same game therefore it becomes boring and repetitive very quickly. I am surprised because the Hoyle games are usually very good. Their Card Games is an excellent game.
If I knew this produce had the same games over and over, I would never purchased it.

..

35477562 It is the exact same games as at the casino and a good learning tool. You can see which programs might pay out and which are for fun. A good way to play without spending a fortune in a smoke filled, noisy casino. It is the little older games like texas tea but still favorites.

..

35477562 It has some of the game in the local casino in my area......I enjoy playing.

..

35477562 This is a great buy! Set up for this is incredibly easy although I highly recommmend before starting play that you go to the manufacturer and download any patches or upgrades to avoid problems. I did this with a differernt game maker and it was simple and kept things running perfectly.
The games are set up just like they are in the casinos and are so much fun. When you play, you may want to adjust the sound to only include the game sounds and eliminate the casino background noise. It's annoying because say you're playing Twin Win, it's bothersome to hear bonus round music from Beaver Dam.
I love this colletion because casinos are phasing out these classic video slots for the new games and it's a nice thing to have if you love the older games like I do.

..

35477562 I bought this game specifically for Wolf Run. Graphics & sounds are great - just like in the casino. There ARE fireworks if you hit a big jackpot. The other games are ok, but again, the game to play is Wolf Run. Changing machines, sounds and editing are very user friendly. If you are a Wolf Run fanatic, you will love this game.

..

35477562 Okay I read the last two reviews, and the information is not accurate. First off all Wolf Run is my favorite game at an actual Casino and this game is a great duplicate of the game(YES INCLUDING THE SOUNDS). I have to agree with the other customer if you are just looking for sound, then go to a real live casino and loose your money for the sound. Texas Tina,Twin Win, and catch a wave are the real deal. Hey come on its only 19.99.....I bet you would loose that in a real casino is less then five minutes. So trust me when I say it's worth the buy, if you don't want to head to Vegas or one of the reservations:)

..

35477562 This is my review... First let me say that these are computer games and you're not playing in a REAL Casino. They are not going to be the exact same... What I have heard is that you are not HAPPY with the MUSIC. Who cares about the music!! If the game is playing the way that is it supposed to play then you are all good! I think that you have nothing better to do then right a bad review about a CASINO GAME!!! If you are that unhappy then go to a real CASINO.. Thanks!

..

35477562 The game says that its just like the real slot machines that is a lie.The music is different on the game.It don't even seem the same the bonus rounds are different.My biggest problem is if the songs were going to be different don't advertize the game is just like the real thing.I woujld not waste your money on this game.

..

35477562 I bought this game and preorder it from masque, I would like to say I was so highly very disappointed in the game. It says the game is fully and authentically replicated. For starters on Catch A Wave. Instead of having the Beach Boys Song Catch A Wave. It has some other song. The original song for Mystical Mermaids is supposed to be Splish Splash. But they removed that song and replaced it. The song on Dam Lumberjack Beavers Freeze Frame has been removed. There is some other song. These songs on Texas Tina have been removed Cotton eye Joe, We Are Family. They took out the fireworks in Wolf Run and now only time you will see fireworks in if you hit several thousands of dollars. The Sea Creatures on Twin do not even make sounds at all. The reels on the game seem to stick. The new songs they added dont even match the theme of the slots. I wish they bring the original songs back. Very highly recommend saving your money till they get it fixed. You will be very extemely highly disappointed!

Shop and read on the go with this digital reader. With over 2.3 million books, newspapers and magazines to choose from and a touch screen, a world of books is at your fingertips.


..

35477562 I bought this item as a gift and at first I heard it was a pretty good item then a couple days later I was told it wasn't user friendly. When trying to download certain items onto the ereader it charged for books that weren't selected. Too bad so sad, had to return it. :(

..

35477562 The ereader is exactly what I wanted and works great.

..

35477562 I got this ereader for Christmas. It is great! It is very easy to use. I like that it is very lightweight. It is easy to download books. It is the perfect ereader for those who want an ereader for reading. I highy recommend this product!!!

..

35477562 I had put off buying the Kobo until I had done some research but when the new Touch came out, I decided that it time to purchase one. I like the lightness of the reader, the ease of use, the capability of expanding the memory, etc. Would recommend this item to others. I own several other readers but the Kobo has become a quick favorite.

Kodak DVD Rewritable Media - DVD+RW - 16x - 4.70 GB - 25 Pack Spindle - 120mm2 Hour Maximum Recording Time


..

35477562 They are not 16x dvd's, but are actually 4x dvd's. The advertisement for this product says 16x and until I received them and called Best Buy to tell them about it, the picture showed they were actually 4x dvd's. The other Kodak Dvd-rw also shows in the picture they are 4x and not 16x as advertised. I believe the product is fine it's just wrong advertisement.

Enjoy on-the-go entertainment with this Lenovo Yoga 10 59387999 tablet, which features a 10.1" 10-point multitouch display with IPS technology for clear visuals and easy navigation. The Android 4.2 Jelly Bean operating system simplifies use.


..

35477562 This is a decent tablet that is relatively easy to use. A great price for a 10" tablet that is equivalent in price to smaller screens.

..

35477562 Bought it for the wife, for reader and browser ,,just right,, thinking about buying another,, tired of small smart phone browsing/email

..

35477562 Great tablet for the price, especially with the price match I got from BestBuy. The battery life is as fantastic as everyone says, but I actually find the bulging 'spine' to be more of a nuisance than a help. I went from a Samsung Chromebook to this and bought the optional Lenovo Bluetooth keyboard offline which definitely adds to the appeal of this tablet. Unfortunately, the Yoga seems to be designed to work best with this keyboard as a hybrid laptop or as a cooking utensil than a tablet. I could see how the bulge on the side could aid in the way you hold it and preventing fatigue, but its so small that I find it hard to hold the tablet in portrait mode without my hands getting fatigued from holding the spine and screen without fear of dropping it. The screen resolution is decent for the size of the screen and the battery life is stellar, but the sometimes awkward way you have to hold it and annoying lack of an app drawer leaves a little to be desired.

35477562 last week , I ordered one for my mom desktop. it was build window vista
now I upgrade new window 7 pro. it run fast and reliable . speed is
amazing , I would give 5 stars.

..

35477562 Recently upgraded my modem, router (from Linksys AE3000 to ASUS RT-N66R), and Comcast package to Blast (50Mbps) internet speed. Last piece of puzzle was upgrading home PC from AE1000 to AE3000 adapter. Now get full 5 bars (before was about 3) and steady speed of 450 Mbps (was anywhere from 80-230 Mbps). Comcast speed test result before upgrade was 15.37 Download (19.07 peak) and 10.42 Upload (11.97 peak). After AE3000 install result was 53.77 Download (55.97 peak) and 11.73 Upload (12.04 peak). Was worried driver would not work on Windows 8.1 but no issues at all.

Take plenty of games, music and videos on the go with this Mach Speed Trio Stealth G2 tablet, which features a generous 8GB capacity for storing media. The 8" capacitive touch-panel display simplifies operation and offers crisp, detailed images.


..

35477562 Very pixalated poor screen. Camera takes poor pictures. Battery runs down fast even without use. Back gets really hot. Unable to play some videos.

..

35477562 Got this tablet for Christmas and I hate it. You have to install amazon for apps and you can only download half of them. The tablet is very pixelated and runs very slow. I had it for about 3 weeks using it for music(only thing I could get to work on it) and then it started to lag. Music would skip and crash the device. About two weeks later, the thing just quit. Now, it won't turn on or even charge.

Navigate your next trip using this Magellan RoadMate 2210T GPS that features a 4.3" touch-screen display and voice prompts to help you easily find a destination. The OneTouch favorites menu makes it easy to bookmark favorite locations.


..

35477562 So far so good,takes me where I want to go without fumbling for a map ( or asking directions)

..

35477562 I am trying to find a downtown Houston address - this GPS does autofill the street name. Used google maps and went to the address, and this street is in the GPS unit. This is supposed to be used for finding addresses every time in a major city, and at a major traffic center, but it can't so of what use it is if one still uses google to do it.
The range of the prompt is also wide like 150 feet. For example, if you need to turn, the car is in the intersection where you want to make the turn, but it says to turn in 150 feet.
The traffic camera alerts seems to be out-of-date, as it detects broken traffic cameras.
The screen is also not bright, making it difficult to read the written prompts on a bright day when the gps is installed to the windshield.
In summary, do not buy this GPS, if there was a negative star, that is
what this product will get.

..

35477562 This is a great GPS unit. It does what is needed without all the bells and whistles the newer more expensive models have. Simple, Basic, and does what is intended. What more could I ask for.

..

35477562 Bought this product when my older GPS locked up. I use a GPS several times a day. This Magellan was usually off by about 300 meters to the north. Once, it also told me to take a right, do a u-turn and then turn right, back to the same road I was originally on. Absolutely terrible directions. It also takes about 6-10 minutes to find the signals to navigate.

..

35477562 We all have experienced customer service issues. But Magellan is by far the worst I have experienced in my entire life. I've been trying to contact the for two months now. 15-20 minutes on hold every day. They sent me an email saying that I can download the fix from their website but there's nothing. I really don't know if there's only one person answering the phone. Unbelievable.

..

35477562 Great GPS for the price. Traffic works. I did like my old garmin but this got the job done.

..

35477562 Great GPS for the price ($69) I can't really complain about it for what I paid for it. This is the basic GPS you can buy. It's not fancy and does not have all the options but for the price you pay it can't be beat. It is a bit picky about address locations and you may have trouble finding rural places. For example, a friends address is in MILAN MI well the gps only found the address for the town OAK-VILLE WALTZ. So if your having trouble typing the address in and finding it see if you can change the town or city. Also, it takes a while to "re-calculate" if you miss a turn, but not enough to cause you that much bother. Like I said for 69 bucks it is great and I don't think you will find better for that price range.

..

35477562 it did very well even when we had to take side trips it even knew when traffic was going to be bad and gave us alternate routes. my daughter figured it should have a name since it was talking to us for 7 hours so she named it valerie. When we were driving up the mountain we had to turn it off due to all the twist and turns it became confused and was trying to correct non stop.

..

35477562 this gps works well but not always the best at dropping you on the doorstep of your desired location.

..

35477562 Love that this gps is easy to set-up and use. Great price.

This expandable phone system features caller ID to help you identify callers before you answer the phone and call transfer so you can switch external calls between handsets.

35477562 Too busy and to small lettering on the front of the phone..

35477562 
This cordless phone system comes with 4 handsets and can be expanded up to 5 handsets for placement around your home. The call-waiting caller ID conveniently displays the name and number of incoming calls, so you know who it is before answering.


..

35477562 STATIC STATIC STATIC
deplorable ring tones
this phone has some great features, but if it can't work perfectly as a phone then the features are useless.

..

35477562 Has a really nice feel. The only issue I have is the phones say new CID on all phones but after i clear it or look at it, it still says it on the OTHER phones. Not a big deal. Over all these are really nice phones.

..

35477562 Many options, great intercom, sound is pleasing to the ear, many ring tones to identify callers, most enjoyable experience for a person who does not like talking on the phone.

..

35477562 The Motorola L404 DECT 6.0 cordless phones with stylish handset, great value and easy to use answering system with message counter. Features include: Interference free digital technology,3-line backlit display, clock, and call waiting caller ID. The answering machine gives you remote access to messages and the ability to leave audio memos for family members. The cordless phone requires only one phone jack and has a range of up to 160 feet indoors and 980 feet outdoors.

..

35477562 I have only had this phone and answering machine for about a month but, thus far, I could not be happier. Having four sets added a level of convenience around the house.
I get good reception at least to 400 feet away from the house. That is just as far as I have gone - the actual usable distance could be considerably further.
The price was great, the set up was quick and easy and the sound quality seems great.
The only thing that might make this phone set even more convenient would be a clip that could allow a user to clip the phone to a belt for outside, hands free carry. The phone is slim enough to fit into a pant pocket, however I worry about inadvertant button activation and, at 6 inches long, it can be awkward in a pocket.

..

35477562 
Enjoy clear calls with this expandable phone system that features 3-party conferencing for conference calls and call transfer so you can switch external calls between handsets.


..

35477562 Overall these phones are much better than the previous ones I had bought from Best Buy. Motorolla is a good product and worth the investment.

..

35477562 It seems very good EXCEPT that when I put the 3 portable phones back onto its cradle, it doesn't always show the lines going up and down which means it is not on properly. I have to do it a few times to make sure, otherwise it is not charging. I even wipe the metal connectors but I shouldn't have to do that every time. Also, the battery life is not as good as my other portable phones. It does dead in about 3 days instead of 5-7 days when not charged. Also, no flashing light to say that we have a message and the light that does show that we have a message is very dim.

..

35477562 I bought it sight unseen on-line. Dummy... dummy...dummy!

..

35477562 These phones are not well designed. One handset does not work- only some of the buttons actually function when they are pressed. The keypads are not lit, so calling in dim light is a bit annoying. Using the functions are not very intuitive, in fact they are the opposite. I usually keep all my boxes from electronics 'just in case', of course this box was tossed or I would have returned it in the first week or two. Definitely not worth the little I saved getting it as the 'deal of the day'-

..

35477562 The great thing about this phone is I love it how it works is excellent Function with three other phoneand like the ringtone and it have more thing that come with it.

..

35477562 Long lasting when fully charged works great in old houses with concrete walls.

..

35477562 Features are not as good as expected. These phones are not near as good quality phones as they replaced.

..

35477562 I love having the corded phone along with the convenience of the three cordless handsets.

..

35477562 Phone system is ok but very disappointed that the phones do not have a back light. In the dark it is impossible to dial or see any of the buttons. Phone does have good reception and good battery life

..

35477562 These Motorola phones are very well made, full of necessary functionality, and ergonomic. They easily fit in your pocket when working outside.
The only drawback is the documentation - there is no quick search index to find instructions, but the instructions are clearly written.

Defend your Apple iPhone 5 or 5s against damage with this Ballistic Hard Core HC0956-M005 case, which features 5 layers to offer protection from fingerprints, scratches, dust and damage due to drops. Button and port covers help keep out debris.


..

38401651 I ordered the black and hot pink case. It came and it was definitely not hot pink. It was a sort of purplish baby pink - not at all like the pictures on Best Buy's site or on Ballistic. I brought it back and all I had to say to the Best Buy guys was, "this was supposed to be hot pink" and they said, "which is now purple?" Best Buy was great about it and it was nice that I didn't have to explain the difference in colors. Not sure why the advertised color is so strange.

This wireless gaming headset features oversize padded earcups with a 40mm neodymium magnet for brilliant sound. The detachable, noise-canceling microphone focuses on your speech and minimizes interruptions so you can take your game to the next level.


..

38401651 I purshased this the day it came out,
The packagnig was great,
the features were awesome....
However, the sound quality is poor,
the mic is less that usable,
the battery life on the headset is worthless and it just stops working

..

38401651 First, try and google something like "Wow headset loses connection" or something close to that. All over the internet you will find massive amounts of complaints about this headset losing connection, reconnecting seconds later etc. This is not an infrequent occurance. If you are a gamer and know that you need to be able to communicate all the time, then you understand that this is a huge problem.
After multiple attempts to contact Creative from their support forums, email etc, i have given up completely. Their support for this product is terrible, The problem has been occuring for well over a year and no remedy as of yet.. Not to mention that they are flimsy as all get out. I love them aesthetically, but they are not durable and do not stay connected to the wireles adapter. Just a waste of 160 dollars.

..

38401651 On my second pair and they are about to go back to the store and be replaced with a $15 headset that will at least last longer than this piece of junk.
Granted the headset is comfortable and the sound quality is amazing, the connectivity issues make the highs moot. As many people have pointed out, it is rather annoying to lose the connection signal in the middle of a raid especially when you are in the middle of a sentence. When the connectivity issues first crop up, you are usually reconnected in mere seconds. However, as it progresses you will lose signal for extended periods of time that become longer and longer.
For $160, I expected a product I would be able to use for more than a few months. What honestly surprises me the most is that Blizzard allowed one of their games to be associated with this product. Really, do yourself a favor and not spend the obscene amount of money of these as they have a shorter life than many of the cheaper headsets.

..

38401651 I've owned these for close to a year and on my third replacement set.
First, the ear pieces are held by cheap, flimsy plastic so if you adjust your ear pieces frequently or don't handle them with extreme care you WILL break them (this is all over the internet as a major issue). Even if you baby them as I did, the likely hood of breaking them is high.
Second, the headset and wireless connector frequently lose connection. If your lucky, it will connect automatically within a few seconds or if your not so lucky, you'll spend 15 min pressing buttons to get the connection re-established. This is very aggravating in the middle of a raid when your trying to communicate with your group and suddenly everything goes silent. This problem occurs on both XP 32 bit and Win 7 64 bit.
Sound quality is good - better than most headsets but not great considering the price.
Cool sound driver with creative sound FX and lots of options to customize your experience. CAUTION: will interfere with existing Creative Drivers if you already have a Creative Sound card installed. FYI- The sound driver for the headset has never been updated in over a year from creative.
All in all, the poor quality of the earpiece design (REALLY, REALLY bad design), wireless dropouts and just good sound don't make these worth the price point. Do yourself a favor and don't buy an expensive headset with these problems all for the WoW logo - you will regret the decision
<Aba says> ./Epic Fail

..

38401651 I really like the sound this has. I like that the mic detaches and the cordless feature is great(which is why I bought this model). The voice over is fun to play with. I did by the additional warranty, only to find out that what I thought was an accidental/extended warranty was not, when my toddler helped the puppy to the mic. And according to creative they do not offer replacement mics(even for purchase) which strikes me as odd because the mic detaches.
The one thing I do not like about this headset is when its installed on the computer, you can not switch between headphones and regular speakers--that is the probably the most annoying thing about this headset. It would be nice Creative Labs would fix that.

..

38401651 The only thing these headphones have going for them is that they're really comfortable to wear. But the wireless is sketchy at best. The headphones will frequently get themselves into states that aren't explained in the documentation and have problems syncing up. There's no way to "reset" the headphones, because the buttons don't always work, and there's no way to remove the battery. You simply have to unplug them and let the battery die.
The headphones also don't last. They started off working fine for 3 months, then started having weird connectivity issues. 6 months after purchasing them they're back in the box.
Also, note, Creative will NOT offer any sort of hardware support for failure without the original receipt. Doesn't matter if your device was only made/shipped 6 months ago according to the pn/sn on the box, they refuse to do it. So do NOT lose that little slip of paper if you go against the reviews and buy this product anyway.

..

38401651 really the the worst head set iv ever had i hear random static noises
the mic randomly bugs out on teamspeak ventrilo ect...
and the lights dont work 3/4 of the time
if your looking to get a better head set pick up any random one on the shelf and it would most likely be only thing good is how easy it was to set up and use besides that its junk

..

38401651 The sound delivered by the WoW Sound Blaster headphones is excellent, and they do a great job isolating the outside noise. They are very good looking and the wireless range and strength was pretty good.
I have used them for about 8 months, then the left cup just snapped off. The material used to attach the cups to the over-the-head band is also plastic (they would have been great if they were a type of metal), and this plastic just broke.
I was expecting a $160 gaming headset to last me quite a bit longer than this. I am disappointed to say that they are built so poorly that they are not a good purchase, regardless of sound quality.
I wanted to see if Creative could do something with the 1-year warranty offered with these, but the number on the box was not accepted by their website to submit a ticket. The most frustrating part was trying to get in touch with someone at Creative Labs, their customer service phone number is (800) 998-1000, but that number would eventually just hang up on you, there wasn't anyone there to help me.
I am an avid gamer, and keep to a schedule when playing. I require my gear to get me through the things i want to do and i had to tape the earpiece to the over-the-head band to play for the days while i suffered with this. (see pic if they post it)
I really liked these, but the build quality and the lack of help when i needed it makes this unfit for anyone.

..

38401651 I just sent these back for the second time. First time the usb receiver broke and the second time the mic wasn't up to par with what I had heard. Bottom line is they are a horrible investment for the price save your cash and buy a really good headset! Buyer Beware with this purchase. You will be sending them back within a month!

..

38401651 I had read the reviews on thie headset prior to buying it. And I read about how it's of cheap quality, but most of the reviewers would still recommend it to a friend so i thought I would chance it.
To be honest, I didn't have a problem with the sound quality of the headset or the make of the headset. The sound was really crisp and clear and I could hear everything really well. The headset was light, and the plastic material wasn't a problem for me.
I had issue with the microphone. Sometimes it would work, and then sometimes it wouldn't. Im good with tech, and normally I am able to figure out an issue with a little trouble shooting. For the life of me, I was never able to figure out what would cause the mic to go in and out. Work sometimes, and not work at all other times. Then I had friends on vent complaining that sometimes my mic would be too loud, and sometimes it wouldn't be loud enough. It's like the microphone had a mind of it's own. So, I brought it back and I have exchanged it for the Logitech wireless gaming headset instead.

..

38401651 This is a great tablet for teens and adults alike and it does have excellent screen resolution as well. the only drawback is that there was no wall charger included with the tablet which I thought was kind of strange as well. Overall a great product and I would recommend to anyone looking for a value in any tablet purchase either for themselves or as a gift.

..

38401651 My device wasnt replaced by Amazon that was a known defect in the device. A few months after my year warranty was up I began having problems with the device charge port. We began proping it up or holding it a certain way to charge and then it just quit charging all together. Come to find out this device has a known defect at the charge port and Amazon would not replace item but wanted me to purchase the Kindle HD for my inconvenience. Paid over 200.00 device lasted a year; I would not recommend this purchase of Kindle fire nor Kindle fire HD.

..

38401651 If you're looking for a reasonably priced tablet and you're an Amazon member, this will probably satisfy your most basic needs, barely. If I could do over, would probably opt for an upgraded HD model, especially the new ones.

..

38401651 We purchased this device for our 7 year old and he loves it! There are many education apps he enjoys playing with as well as games. When we are on roadtrips it keeps him very occupied. He has other electronic items to untilize, but he prefers this device over all!

..

38401651 Excellent product for the money & good battery life.

..

38401651 Kids love it had to buy one for each one of my three kids

..

38401651 Love it! Use it for travels, and the out doors! My son is able to use or with ease!

..

38401651 I have since found out one has to PAY to get the instructions which is totally ludicrous to say the least.
Thanks to good friends though who have helped me along the way or I would have returned it. It should prove to be quite handy when I travel abroad in the next few weeks and save carrying several books to read. Hope I can master somewhat the art of using the Internet on this Kindle, again with the help of friends. Can't imagine why any company in the world would produce items which do not come with instructions; a lot of us ARE NOT DEVICE SAVVY.

..

38401651 Bought it for my wife, to replace the very old 1 she had. She loves it and glad I spent the money for it

38401651 Game great for whole family. Fun to play. Great graphics.

..

38401651 I'm not a big gamer. Like a lot of people, Angry Birds is simple to play and big on fun. Took a little getting used to the controls, but once you get the hang of it, it's not bad.

..

38401651 This is a wonderful puzzle game. These are hard to find for your game console these days. I love it my niece and nephew love and since there are multiple games it never gets old.

..

38401651 very fun game easy to use keeps you involved and fun to play with family. Very competitive

..

38401651 Pretty much what I expected. Nothing too outstanding. If you've
played the game before, it's pretty much what you get. No
complaints whatsoever. Keeps you entertained.

..

38401651 The Angry birds trilogy is a great game for players of any age. The game is huge, three games in one, so there is a lot of play time. The game itself if fun, humorous, entertaining, and challenging. I could say it is geared for a wide audience so many fans of shooters and MMO's may write it off as a children's game. I disagree. The game is brilliant. The simple design is loaded with deep colors and backgrounds. The music and sound effects are funny and entertaining. The bright colorful animations can be appreciated by everyone. The game play itself is very easy to master, but as the game progresses, it may get challenging for younger players. Also it has may secrets (golden eggs) to be found by more experienced gamers. The game is pretty basic, shooting birds into structures built by the pigs, sworn enemies of the birds. Its a simple concept that is beautifully woven into a good sized game that can be enjoyed by players of all ages. Even as an adult, I often find my self laughing at the simple but absurd sounds and animations that are in the game.

..

38401651 This has been so much for my whole family of all ages and we have all of the angry birds PS3.

..

38401651 I quickly mastered the game and even more quickly how to sidestep the boring action. This is a waste of money unless it is for a small child.

..

38401651 It isn't often that I find a game that my whole family enjoys: this is it! It is very easy to use and fun to play. This is coming from a mom who doesn't like many video games.

..

38401651 I thought the game is better on my android than on the ps3.

..

38401651 music on the go and easy to operate !! love love love it

..

38401651 I bought the ipod nano for my wife to use when she works out. She loves that it's easy to use and definitely lightweight. The only downside she sees is maybe forgetting about it out not noticing you lost it if not careful as it is so lightweight. That's why she also bought an armband for it and only uses it when working out.

..

38401651 Easy to use, portable (of course), home button is back.

..

38401651 I use this at the gym and love it. easy to change songs good sound

..

38401651 Its great for my needs, goes from work to the gym and beyond

..

38401651 I love the way I can track my excercise sessions & all the fun features. The size is a bonus too.

..

38401651 Good reception cameras ok easy to hear many apps like fingerprint turn on

..

38401651 When my previous iPod Nano went missing (and eventually found going through the wash -- but it still works), I really wanted a new Nano to hold my music. While missing the click wheel, this is still a very good MP3 player, and it shows why Apple is tops.

..

38401651 I use it for running. It's the perfect size. Just wish I could download pandora or iTunes Radio.

..

38401651 I received the IPod Shuffle for Christmas and I absolutley love it. I take it to exercise, use it in the car while I am waiting for someone or sometimes while I am just relaxing. It is so easy to use. The only problem is when I use the clip on attachment , I sometimes change the song. Its not a big problem but would be nice if you could figure out another way of using that. It would not prevent me from getting another IPod though. Love it!!!

38401651 Super awesome and extremely pleased to give this to my wife

..

38401651 I paid a lot of money for this device. It won't sync to my iTunes!!! I'm angry and very upset I paid good money for something I can't use!!!
I tried contacting Apple with no success. I'm very disgusted with this entire purchase!!! What's worse, I'm still paying for it on your credit card!!!!!!

..

38401651 Holds lots of music for the music lovers. It was a great gift!

..

38401651 The next generation isn't really enough to warrant trading up except for the Up band I needed it for.

..

38401651 This is my fourth iPod and so far my favorite. I needed a iPod that would hold all my music (6000+) and still give me room for my favorite apps and my photos. Other than the scroll button I have no regrets with my purchase.

..

38401651 Over the years I have had several MP3 players: 3 different second to third gen iPod mini's, a second gen iPod touch which was my main unit up until I purchased this fifth gen unit, and a slew of generic brand MP3's from makers like Coby. Most of the players I get are for work and are considered throw-away units, but for my personal I want something that is reliable and wont just stop working on me for no reason. My second gen iPod touch still works great, as do all of my iPod minis but I have been at the maximum storage for a long time now, and like having all my music in one collection so I finally broke down and bought myself a new 64GB model and have been loving it. Aside from having a lot of apps I don't use I am pleased with the features as well as the stand by and run time. I play a few games here and there and notice that they are much faster and more responsive. Overall I should have upgraded a long time ago, and am happy with my purchase.
On a side note, I dropped the iPod yesterday and it come away without a scratch on it. Faring better than my phone from a similar height (sitting) on a harder surface (linoleum for the iPod, a floor mat for the phone).

..

38401651 I recently bought the 5th Generation Touch. Previously, I had the 4th generation Touch, and I seem to have problems with some of the music applications functioning to their full capacity. Now everything is great with the 4th generation, and I have a portable music studio in the palm of my hands.

..

38401651 Nice to be finally caught up with all my friends with technology

..

38401651 What can you say about iPods? They are awesome. ..... they save lives.....
make people happy.....settle arguments. ......put babies to sleep........
They do everything!!!

..

38401651 I like it. The battery life does drain pretty quick when using it so it's a drawback that I have to keep my charger close by. I didn't like that it didn't come with the wall charger adapter piece. Overall once you get used to the Apple system it's a pretty good product. Not sure if it's worth the amount of money I paid for it but still pretty good. Easy to use and setup. I love that there is no menu button.

38401651 More free aps than iphone, I was always an iPhone fan and I was undecided to buy this phone or the iPhone 5. I am glad I went with the new htc one x. Not only gives you a bigger screen but more free apps.

..

38401651 HTC One X takes beautiful photos and you can even take a snapshot from video.

..

38401651 I love my HTC One X, I'm so glad the price dropped $100. I wasn't going to buy it before, but as soon as the price dropped, I jumped at the chance. It is quite large, especially compared to the HTC Aria I had previously, but all HTC phones are pretty large these days. I have small hands, so it's hard to hold it with one hand and text or scroll through a page, especially if I'm walking at the same time. It for sure doesn't fit in my back pocket, much less my front pocket. It would probably fit in a guys pants pocket. The size is pretty much my only issue with the phone. The battery life is standard for a smartphone - about a day if used heavily. I do charge it every night, regardless. I didn't realize how much I needed the Beats Audio, but now that I have it, it's hard to listen to anything else. The sound is incomparable to any other phone out there. The screen is absolutely gorgeous, the colors are true, but the actual screen collects fingerprints and dust pretty easily, which can impede visibility in sunlight. 4G LTE is incredibly fast, but it does suck up battery life, so I mostly just use wi-fi. (I'm on a college campus, so there isn't anywhere without wi-fi) There are a ton of features on this phone that you could miss, so I would definitely recommend going onto the HTC website or YouTube and exploring a bit. I've had my phone for about a month and am still learning something new about it every day!

..

38401651 I was looking for a phone with a bigger screen for my big hands. I have owned iphones, htc and blackberries before. That being said, I was waiting around for the new iphone but when my 2 year old blackberry started failing me on a daily basis I went in to check the current options. The HTC popped out at me right away-specifically its smooth basic design, durability feel. I started playing with it and everything just seemed to fall in place. The layout is intuitively placed. I checked the iphone 4s, the new samsung s3 and note and while they had their own pros here and there I just couldn't connect with them. The first was too small and the latter ones had a flimsy cheap quality feel to them. As with any other smartphone, I had my fears that the batterly quality was going to be poor but I have been pleasantly surprised. I disconnect my phone in the morning at 7:00 am in the morning and start texting, checking emails, making phone calls, getting on conference calls, take pictures of the kids running wild around me, play some music for an hour or two while I am crunching numbers and preparing for meetings and by 9 pm I finish with my last conference calls and make my last calls and texts and find that the battery is down to 30%. Over the weekend, I charge it Friday night and given that I slow considerably on my work I do not charge my phone again until Monday afternoon. Bottom line, battery, which is a smartphone's Achilles heel, is better than advertised-simply put-it's tony the tiger GREAT!
Trust me, this phone is a BEAST for texting, playing music, taking pictures, surfing the web, making calls and anything else not mentioned. You will not be disappointed in this phone.

..

38401651 I have owned an iPhone 4 and most recently a Samsung Galaxy S 2 (both on AT&T). While I didnt care for the small screen of the iPhone or the Apple control freaks, I really grew to detest the Galaxy. In the year that I owned it, it was plagued with hardware and software problems which Samsung and AT&T were unable to fix. After AT&T replaced the Android Gingerbread OS with Ice Cream Sandwich OS things got worse. Sometimes I couldnt even make or receive calls. Since the Galaxy was under warranty, AT&T was willing to replace it with a HTC One X. I have used the One X for a week now and can report that it is a vast improvement over the Galaxy and even the iPhone. Basically, it operates flawlessly. Speed of operations is excellent. Applications operate reliably without crashing.
The screen is big and provides beautiful color rendering and, while it doesnt have the high contrast of the Galaxy, it doesnt oversaturate colors like the Galaxy did. Conversation audio quality is great. Unfortunately, the speaker is on the flat surface of the rear panel, so both audio quality and volume decrease when the phone is placed on its back. The volume and power buttons are almost flush mounted so activating either is a bit challenging. Based on other reviews I had concerns about battery life but, even with moderate use, it lasts two days between charges. Finally, the HTC Sync Manager makes synchronizing files and information with your PC a real pleasure and a vast improvement over iTunes.
Overall, this is the best smartphone I have ever used.

..

38401651 Perhaps the best Android phone in the market. The ICS + HTC Sense combination is great - the interface is smooth. The screen is gorgeous. Battery life is good too - goes upto 2 days on a single charge. Sound quality is great. Camera quality is superb.

..

38401651 The "Smart" part of the phone is excellent! The screen is nice and bright. Moving from screen to screen is fast. All apps I have loaded seem to work well. With Android 4.x, you can disable most of the useless memory hog apps AT&T bundles with the phone. Battery life for me is approx 48 hours per charge. Better than any smart phone I've owned.
Now the bad... As a phone, it's awful! My most recent issue was last night. I dropped a call 4 times and had at least 2 bars at all times. If I go from no signal area (such as in a steel structured warehouse) to signal area, sometimes the phone needs to be rebooted before it will start working again. Going from from regular 3G/4G to 4G LTE locks the phone up. Has to be rebooted. On my second ONE X with a new SIM card. No improvement!
If you want the phone for a camera, email, games and for use as an e-reader, this is a great device. As a phone, IMO, it's not dependable...

..

38401651 this is a good phone. I am enjoying it.
Good camera. watch netflix often.

..

38401651 I've had this tablet for about 3 weeks now and love it! I use it for reading books (pre-installed Kindle was nice) and newspapers, as well as a portable design/business PC, and have awatched a few Netflix shows on it too. The built-in speakers are surprisingly good; I haven't tried the headphone jack yet, but it is located in a logical place.
The fact that it has a full Windows 8.1 pre-installed is great, though it'd be even better if it were 64-bit. No matter. I've been using Windows 8 for over a year so nothing was new for me on that count, but I'll just say it's well-implemented on this tablet and everything runs smooth and quick. Wake-up to home screen is under 10 seconds easily. A hugely useful but small feature: a hardware button to turn off/on screen rotate. I have had other tablets and it's generally really a pain to go into device settings to access this feature; having a button next to the volume toggle is perfect.
I installed Adobe Production Suite on it and it runs Photoshop and other design apps just fine, and having a dedicated pen (which sits in a little, almost invisible side slot) is the main reason I bought it. Now I can do sketches for clients and bring them right into my other applications without scanning or anything else.
I especially like how light it is, and I never get tired reading with it. The screen is just right for size and very clear and has yet to pick up even the smallest scratch (I don't generally use a cover).
It does a solid job of picking up wireless connections and has decent down/up-load speeds.
Lenovo support is good, and about a week after purchase it downloaded a range of hardware related updates (not just junk apps being pushed by Lenovo).
The exterior overall doesn't have that really nice, super-thin metal finish that something like the Surface does, but it has so much going for it, (and is HALF the price of a Surface Pro with a pen), it's pretty hard to complain. In every respect this device is a bargain, and honestly, they have to be loosing money on it to sell it for $300.
It DID come with maybe 4-5 apps of bloatware, but they uninstalled easily and I haven't had one issue since. One minor nit is that though the wall-wart charger looks like nothing special, it's the only thing that can charge it up and still have the tablet "on". Anything else and you'll need to do a full Shut down- again not a big deal.

..

38401651 Really easy to set up on network, and the app navigation is good.
I've noticed that the picture quality seems to be better at night, because there's a large window in the room giving a lot of sunlight on the screen. Tempted to rearrange the room to cut down on the light interference.
One of the connections (I think the component cables) is on the side instead of the back where all the other USB/HDMI inputs are, and it took me FOREVER to find. I don't understand why they didn't just put everything in the same area.

..

38401651 After careful review of all TV brands I am very happy with the LG product. One thing you have to know when buying any new flat screen, the manufacturer puts the speakers in the back and you must buy a sound bar to get the full affect of your home theater system. I went with the wireless LG sound bar and its the best gift I could have bought for myself and my family.

..

38401651 Great set, sales associate Damian at copperfield store was a huge help!

..

38401651 This is a really great TV for my bedroom. It's the perfect size, the picture is really good and I really like the smart TV features. It's great to connect to the internet and watch free People On Receiving eNd.

..

38401651 I was looking to upgrade to a "smart" TV. It was only after 4 TVs later that I found this TV. I tried Vizio and Samsung and while these TVs were nice, they seemed to be lacking in the features dept. I was trying to stay away from Best Buy because I felt their prices would be to high. Ironically, they had the exact size and features at a price that was better than anywhere else I had been.

..

38401651 Bought the floor model as Best Buy did not have it in stock. Took it home and set it up. It has a great picture and sound and works with my cable remote.

..

38401651 What we like: excellent picture quality/resolution, easy to use.
What we don't like:
- still some bugs in the Internet feature's movie playing ability (we saw some Star Trek fan fiction movie blips, such as video stopping without warning while the audio continues.
- if you have old, composite A/V gear, this is not a friendly TV. We were forced to buy a replacement for our old DVD player and found it difficult to connect our WII. We also ended up acquiring a sound bar because we could not connect our elderly stereo and we were not entirely happy with the speakers installed in the TV.

..

38401651 Did lots of reading and research (in-stor) before purchase. Largely stuck with LG / Samsung. Wanted at least 3 HDMI, 3 USB, Internet ready, quality picture and good reviews across wide audience... on a budget under $700 out the door.
This tv hit all the checkmarks since the store was out of inventory, I purchased the display model... and a top-shelf Sony Blu-ray... home uner budget...
I would recomment this tv to anyone that has the same checklist as I did.
The Best-Buy in North Irving has a bright, friendly, knowledgable team that will work with you to your satisfaction --- GO Grant and team!!!

..

38401651 It was time to upgrade our eleven-year old 32" Std-Def television and I wanted to take full advantage of our Dish Network HD capabilities. This is our main "family viewing" TV so it gets a lot of use. There's a lot of info here some for the "geeks" and some to give a "heads-up" as to how this TV will interface with your existing audio, video and game equipment or not and some general considerations when looking at any flat screen TV.
I had one limiting parameter to meet: any new television had to fit our existing TV cabinet. The largest screen I could fit was 42 inches. Because of this restriction I was thankfully limited to a relative handful of makes and models. I have good experiences with both LG and Samsung so I looked at those manufacturers first. I did a lot of research in making my decision, read a lot of reviews both professional and customer and quickly weeded out the lesser models. The choice came down to a 42"LG or Samsung no surprise there.
In a nutshell: the 42" Samsung has the "best" picture. The 42" LG has the "best" viewing angles. I use "best" in quotes because everyone is different with regard to their visual perceptions. By the book the technical aspects the performance numbers and professional reviews the Samsung has the better picture. It has a truer, darker black level than the LG and this gives a greater range of contrast and a richer picture. The cost? The Samsung has a *very* narrow viewing angle. As long as you're sitting straight on, things look great. However, move off center very much and picture quality degrades quickly; I got to see this with the in-store display. The LG, on the other hand, does not have the deep black level capability and so its contrast is not as great as the Samsung. Outside of the contrast differences the two 42 inch TV's are neck and neck picture-wise. Where the LG shines is in how wide its viewing area is. With the LG you can be sitting at a significant angle from front and center and still enjoy a high quality picture. Again, I saw this with the in-store display. With the LG, it's almost akin to watching a CRT (tube) type screen. In short the LG, with its wide viewing angles, makes a much better family room TV than the Samsung. Viewing angle was the primary reason I chose the LG over the Samsung.
Don't get hung up on the the black level and contrast differences. Unless you have side by side comparison of the two TV's being fed video test signals or scene-specific movies showing the differences of the two sets, you're going to be very happy with the LG. I am. The picture quality of the LG is super and I'm amazed at how far off-center one can sit and still enjoy a great picture. IMHO viewing angle can be just as important, if not more so, as "best picture" status. All flat screens will have a degradation in viewing quality, LCD's and LED's in particular, when viewing at other than straight on. Consideration of how you're going to be viewing your flat screen is an important assessment in choosing a make or model.
Something else to look at when considering these televisions are inputs: what kind and how many. HDMI is the standard Hi-Def interface these days. It's often used to connect your Satellite/Cable box and DVD player; it can also be used for the latest game systems. Make sure you assess what you have and what you need for Hi-Def connections. The LG has FOUR HDMI sockets. The other Hi-Def connection is via component video which uses the three-cable connection, one each for the primary colors (Red, Green, Blue). Analog audio input is handled via a standard stereo cable. The LG has *ONE* component video/stereo audio connection. This was the secondary reason I chose the LG; the number of Hi-Def inputs meant I had enough for my needs plus a few spare.
Equally important is addressing older equipment. We have an older Sony Wii (standard def) and it uses a composite video connection (a single cable with a yellow RCA plug). You might have a VCR or other video equipment using a composite video connection. You might also have older equipment using an S-video connection. With respect to std-def video connections, the LG is *very limited*. The component video connection will work with *either* composite or component video connections but not both; it's one or the other. There are NO S-video connections. Also realize std-def signals look absoutely awful on flat screen TV's of any ilk (LCD, LED, Plasma) especially larger screens. Ergo the manufacturers decision not to provide many, if any, std-def video inputs.
The LG has ONE *optical* digital audio output; there is *no* analog (stereo) output. The optical output can be used to send digital audio to a stand-alone receiver/amp with a surround sound decoder or to a separate "sound bar" speaker system equipped for optical input (The LG sound bar speaker system uses an optical connection). This optical connection is the *only way* to get "off-air", "off-internet" or "streaming" surround sound encoded audio from the TV. If you only have coax digital audio connections on your receiver/amp then you will need a converter (optical to coax) to make the connection. Likewise, if all you have are analog stereo inputs then you will also need a converter (optical to analog stereo).
Miscelleaneous inputs: there are THREE USB ports to connect external hard drives, thumb drives and card readers.
Headset: one incredibly inconvenient mini-jack located in the middle *back* of the set. In a pinch, this could be used to supply a stereo analog signal to a stand alone stereo receiver using appropriate cables. Obviously this is not a "line level" signal so any adjustment to TV volume will effect the audio level of the headset output.
To get the most utility from this LG "smart TV" you should have it connected to the internet. Our wireless router sits atop our TV cabinet and so running the cable was easy. You can by a wireless LAN module if your set is not located near your router (and it has wireless capabilities). Once you have internet connection you enable the ability to stream video from any number of subscription services included with the TV's software, watch YouTube and access the internet. You have the ability to easily update the installed software (which you should do). This model does not have Blue Tooth capability so using a Blue-Tooth keyboard for surfing the web is a no-go. An optional, extra cost "Magic Remote" is available from LG that supposedly makes surfing the web easier and has other programming functions for the TV not available on the standard remote.
After living with this TV for the past month or so the only downside I can report has to do with the sound from the bult-in speakers; it's awful. I have yet to find the magic "tweak" to get the audio on this set to anything approaching listenable. I'm not expecting it to sound like my full-on surround system but certainly better than the tinny, transister radio sound it has. For news or talk it's passable but for handling the wide dynamic ranges of DVD movie sound tracks forget it. I regard myself as fairly tech savvy and knowledgeable; I've tried every sound option/combination available to make this set listenable but to no avail so far. I may just break down and buy a sound bar. In it's defense, the audio quality (or lack thereof) is no worse than most flat screen TVs. Given the tight quarters of most LCD/LED TVs there's little room to install speakers of any significant size nor does the small casing create much of an enclosure for the speakers.
Overall I've been very happy with the 42" LG. The picture is great and the online features are plentiful. The size is large enough for our family room needs while fitting nicely into the existing cabinet. Setup of the set and the "remote familiarization" process went off without a hitch. Due to it's very wide (for a flat screen LED TV) viewing angle, the LG is an excellent TV to use in a room with a wide-spread seating arrangement; this is it's strongest asset. Also a big plus, for its size, the LG has a wealth of Hi-Def connections and USB inputs. It's drawbacks? Limited standard def connections (just the one composite video) and lack of analog (stereo) outputs. The digital audio output is via optical; no coax connection. I don't consider the audio quality of the set to be a drawback; it is the nature of all but maybe the largest screens to have less than stellar audio; the LG is no better or worse than other comparably sized flat screens and you may not think it sounds all that bad anyway. I highly recommend you consider the LG 42LN5700 Smart TV.

38401651 Purchased at BestBuy.com, this process was easy and arrived on time. However, the first TV had a cracked screen right out of the box. Called Best Buy customer service and they made it easy. They scheduled a pick up from my house and sent a replacement which arrived only 2 days after damaged TV went out. Anyway, on to the TV. Picture is very clear and no blurring watching March Madness. Picture is better than my Sanyo LCD (which was pretty good). Easy to set up. You have to assemble the stand, then attach the stand to the TV, then just plug it in. The stand is plastic, but was sturdier than I expected after reading the reviews. I'm not worried about it falling over.
We placed this TV in an entertainment center in a 18'X18' living room. The 42" is a little small for that size room but was the absolute largest we could fit. I initially had the TV in the very front of the enclosed entertainment center. However, the sound was not sufficient. After playing around with it a little I found that pushing the TV in a couple inches allowed the sound to fill the room and made a big difference. Hope that tip helps. Smart TV pretty cool too. Just put your wifi password in and your ready to go. Even synchs with my iphone which makes searching more efficient. Overall, very positive experience.

This Lightwedge Versailles Damask cover features a canvas exterior and microfiber interior to protect your e-reader or tablet against bumps and scratches while you're on the go. The elastic closure ensures the case stays securely closed.


..

38401651 I needed something to provide somme protection for my Kindle.
It does that nicely and yet allows easy access and use without having to remove the cover.

..

38401651 Bought it for the Samsung galaxy tax 7.0, it did fit right and was convenient to hold. Felt great. But noticed that it didn't have an opening in the back for the camera, so that means I would have to take the tab out every time I would like to click a pic.

..

38401651 Great cover for the Kindle 1. Liked the design of the cover and the pocket on the inside.

..

38401651 The elastic straps are not strong enough to keep my reader in

..

38401651 This case is great for the price. It looks really nice and protects my Kindle perfectly. I'm glad I purchased this and would definitely recommend it.

..

38401651 We got this for my 9 year old to put her Kindle in. It works well and keeps her from dropping& damaging it on the floor. My only complaint is that it gets grime & dirt on it easily. Probably not able to clean off due to the texture. Good case otherwise!

..

38401651 it was the wrong kind of case for my tablet, I went and got something else that fit better.

..

38401651 I had a case before this where my tab did not feel secure. I love how tightly it's held and how fashionable it looks! I get compliments all the time.

..

38401651 The cover is very classy and fits the tablet great

..

38401651 It slim easy to use and durable. Looks nice from the outside.

Keep in touch with loved ones with this Logitech C170 webcam that features video resolution up to 640x480 and still image capture up to 5.0MP for crisp visuals. The built-in microphone with RightSound technology ensures clear conversations.


..

38401651 A great camera for a reasonable price. picture qulity is good.

..

38401651 The software and camera were very easy to install - instructions were very short but understandable. The cam is very light weight and has a great depth of field and angle of view. Gets a decent picture in simple table lamp light; great picture for the size and money in bright light.
Biggest complaint is that it will not clip to a laptop lid. If you set it on the laptop surface or on a table top nearby, the slightest movement of the laptop will of course move the camera cord and the camera gets pulled off from where you had it pointed. To get around that, I've had to tape it to whatever location I want it to stay in place. That makes movement more than just a foot or so pretty difficult. Not enough negative to not buy but be ready for this.

..

38401651 This is a great little webcam. Worked as plug and play without installing any special software. The USB connector makes it convenient to use with desktop or laptop computers. Very good value for the money. Very functional built-in stand that works on the desktop, over a monitor or off the laptop display. Built-in microphone is of good sound quality. Great engineering.
I liked it so much I bought a second one for my sister in Portland Oregon at a local Best Buy so we can video Skype when I returned home. When setting her new desktop system up we Skyped from one bedroom to another. Ain't the internet wonderful.

Learn more about the New WindowsWith a 23" 10-point multitouch-screen display, this Acer Aspire A5600U-UR11 all-in-one computer simplifies navigation of Web sites, e-mail, menus and more. The 1TB hard drive provides plenty of storage space for your media.


..

41534996 I purched the A5600U All-in-one, one month ago. Since that time, I have had to reset the computer to factory 7 times. The first time, I had to order the recovery discs from Acer at a cost of $20.00, and wait a week for delivery. Since then, I have had to perform a 3 hour system restore/rest 7 times since it was delivered to me brand new just over a month ago. The problem? This computer can not successfully update Windows 8. It fails every single time. The advice I received from Acer technical support was to TURN OFF all Windows updates. This is a horrible solution. It is important to keep the OS updated always. With this computer, for whatever reason...it is impossible. So it is a great computer, yes. Would I ever buy from Acer again? NO! Not until they can sell a product that works well right out of the box. Buyer Beware!

Safeguard your electronics with this surge protector that features 7 outlets with 3-line AC protection and phone line protection. The large, recessed power switch helps prevent accidental shutdowns.


..

41534996 I bought this to create a "charging station" for my phones and electronic devices in a cabinet and keep them off the counter. It does the trick. I affixed this to the wall with the holes in the back of the unit but it was harder to do than it should have been mostly attributable to the shape of the unit.

Warning! Belkin Surge Protector Failed!
We experienced a lighting hit in my son's dorm. He followed all of their documentation request, and included a letter from the university verifying that the building was hit by lighting. Belkin deemed the surge protector working correctly. How can that be? The surge projector failed and all the equipment was fried. Belkin products can NOT be trusted. Save yourself money and buy a different brand.
Our Belkin claim #224223

..

41534996 worked ok but could not plug it into the wall- I have a desk next to the plug and needed a flat plug instead.

..

41534996 So far, this seems like a great surge protector. I haven't had the chance to really test it yet, so I can't comment on its ability to protect sensitive equipment, although their warranty really makes it seem good. I would like to hold Belkin up to their $750,000 replacement guarantee some day.
My only real nag about this strip is that the power switch feels very loose. You can shake the unit and hear the switch shaking in its socket, which doesn't seem to indicate very good craftsmanship on Belkin's part.
Otherwise, fast shipping as usual from Bestbuy.

41534996 I looked for 2 of these for my house and for the price I couldn't find it cheaper anywhere else.

..

41534996 Like other strip surge protectors, there is only 1 outlet available for a large power adapter. There may also be some difficulty with 3 prong plugs next to larger horizontal adapters. Other than that, the price was good for a 7 outlet 2000J surge protector (~14 dollars on sale).

..

41534996 It does what it's supposed to do. I've had no problems.

..

41534996 We looked around for a really good surge protector and this one is very high quality for the price! We plugged in our tV, dvr, Xbox 360, sound bar, woofer, audio player, blu-ray player and still have outlets to spare if we add more components to our system! It's a great design that fits very nicely behind our tv stand. The arrangement of the outlets helps fit larger ones without blocking off the outlets for regular size cord plugs. I feel that our components are very secure with the amount of surge protection it provides. We've had ours for over a year now with no problems. I would definitely purchase another one of these if we need one in the future.

..

41534996 This protector is great. I'm able to put bigger plugs on opposite sides.

..

41534996 This is a great surge protecter mostly for the small thin design and that it still accommodates a good amount of outlets. What I did not like was that it was very hard to screw since only two screws can be used and because of that it falls off the wall therefore I added a tape to the back to keep it up.

..

41534996 I'm use to the Belkin name, but have not purchased their surge protectors until now. I bought this for my parents and they are happy with it. I also purchased the black/charcoal gray for my own use.

..

41534996 Not much to say. It's a surge protector and it's doing what it's supposed to do. We needed it to handle our electronics and so far so good. I also bought one in white for my parents.

..

41534996 The surge protector looks pretty decent. For less than 20 bucks, you get 8 outlets with a 6 feet cord.

..

41534996 It's an affordable adapter for home entertainment center.
Cable modem, router, TV, DVD, TV box, sound bar,.. need to be connected with each other, so you need this powerful adapter, and protect them.

..

41534996 This is the second one of these we bought. We have had no problems with the first one after several years of use. The plugs have not come loose like other cheaper ones.

..

41534996 This is an useful outlet. Every outlet can be used.

41534996 Love the color , really protect my I pad mini , good price.

..

41534996 easy to use and super light. Very stylist as well.

..

41534996 This mini ipad cover offers excellent protection, plus it is stylish...plain cute, in fact.

..

41534996 Highly recommend and great value. ipad branded accessories are often over priced

..

41534996 securely fits mini ipad. also sylish and made of quality.

..

41534996 product fits nice, looks good and fits my needs perfectly.

..

41534996 This is the best case I have owned. Even though it is a little heavy, I know that my device is well protected. I almost didn't buy it because there weren't any color choice (just black/gray) and I was looking for something bright and cute but I couldn't deny the quality of the case verses "cute" and I am glad I made this selection. I think this case will last forever.

..

41534996 Love the case. The magnetic tab holds it closed and a stylus stays nicely inside. The stand feature works great. Protective corners hold the I-Pad inside very securely and protects well.

..

41534996 good product i used it everyday........................................

..

41534996 When I purchased my iPad mini I was traveling so I knew I needed a case. I looked at about a dozen different cases but my main concerns were price and protection. I looked at the keyboard case combo but it was bulky and expensive. I also looked at the Apple smart case but I felt that there just wasn't enough protection around the entire iPad. I also looked at the swivel kind but I didn't want it moving around on me while I tried typing or reading while laying in bed. That's when I saw the Belkin cover. It was exactly what I was looking for. I bought the sleek black & grey one and I really like all the padding around it. I also like how it has a magnetic strap that keeps it closed, which is great for traveling. You can also stand it up horizontally or vertically with this cover. Great choice!

The Belkin Coiled Telephone Handset Cord is the ideal replacement for your telephone's handset cord. This extended length coiled cord gives you more line while working in the office or at home, and the PVC cable jacket construction retains spring and durability despite repeated pulling or stretching.


..

41534996 It is surprisingly difficult to find the right cord between the phone and handset. Many cords will say they work, but when you look at the specs it shows it's the cord between the phone and the wall - not the cord between the phone and handset!

Charge your iPhone or iPod even in crowded outlets with this compact charger that rotates for ease of use. Folding prongs make it simple to stick in a bag for charging on the go. The 4-foot ChargeSync cable lets you connect to your desktop or laptop computer too.


..

41534996 I tend to be less than gentle with my cords. This cord is thicker and seems sturdier than other cords

..

41534996 This charger charges my iPod relatively fast and without any problems. I like that the cable is detachable.

..

41534996 Best Buy has incredible prices online and competitive shipping prices. I love my AC adapter.

..

41534996 Great charger for the price. Although it is not recommended for charging an I Pad it will charge one at a reduced charging rate. It works really well for charging both I Pods and I Phones. The cord is detachable from the wall socket so the cord can also be plugged into a USB port to charge your device. One great feature of this charger is the rotating socket which allows you to plug the charger into a wall outlet in several different orientations and avoid blocking other wall sockets from use.

..

41534996 This works great as a quick charger. This way you don't have to plug in the iPod to the computer. Also works for charging MP3 players etc.

..

41534996 Built sturdy and a good value. I like that the USB can be removed and used on the computer or the wall adapter.

..

41534996 what a bargain! Great price, quality product, thick cord my cat won't even be able to chew threw this one! I just bought another one for my son.

..

41534996 inexpensive charger. can't be the price. My kids are always losing one so this was a good deal.

..

41534996 I bought this specifically because if the cord length. I have also taken this with me to travel, I works both on 110 and 220 current.

..

41534996 Yes I would recommend this product for a replacement for your charger

This iPad 2 stand features 4 adjustable positions for a variety of viewing angles, including a low angle for comfortable typing. The lightweight design offers convenient portability.


..

41534996 Consumer friendly package easy to open. Product set up was a snap. Adjusts to several angles with ease using positive-setting squeeze adjusters built into the base. Stable base with nice no slide coating on the base, bottom channel rest and back rest. Easy to fold up to small portable unit.

..

41534996 Perfect iPad / iPhone / Android tablet holder. I use it in the kitchen to cook and at the dinner table to read. The adjustments are nice although be careful as I almost broke it because I didn't realize I had to press the two tabs in to adjust tilt.
I also own the prior version of this that has one fixed angle. The base is solid and heavy and doesn't fill cheap, you won't be disappointed.

..

41534996 Stand works great. Simple design, plenty of flexibility with several positions (Including almost standing straight up which I saw lacking in other models). Padded nicely to protect the tablet or phone. Works on virtually any tablet or phone.

..

41534996 I bought this for my daughter to use with her IPAD 2. She has some disabilities and the stand makes it much easier for her to sit at the table and use her IPAD for hours.

..

41534996 Bought this for my IPad 2. I use it to read, hold manuals while I build models and tying up documents with the wireless keyboard

..

41534996 This stand folds neatly to be carried in my bag, It has multiple view angles in portrait or landscape that make it great for watching movies or typing. It has a wide enough groove to hold my ipad 2 with my case on it. This is a great all around stand. The price seems about right for this stand and as long as it lasts a long time, I'll be very satisfied with this purchase.

..

41534996 After a thorough search for a table top iPad stand, I found the Belkin FlipBlade stand to be the best due to its ideal size, appearance and most importantly, utility. It has a small footprint, adjustable angles and rubber padding to protect the iPad from scratches in use. The iPad sits sturdy in the wide slot which allows for easy removal even with the smart cover attached. Set an Apple keyboard in front and you have a mini desktop for email and web browsing. Highly recommended.

..

41534996 Works well with my Ipad. Different angles are perfect for watching Netflix or typing. Solid construction.

..

41534996 The flipblade stand accomodates both my iPad and PlayBook. Viewing angles are adjustable and the stand folds flat for travel. Bestbuy had the best price during the past xmas season plus free shipping

..

41534996 I bought this for my son's ipad2. The design and material are high quality; definitely worth the price I paid for it ($14). Our ipad 2 also has the apple oem smart cover. However, this stand enables the ipad to be used in many additional positions. The stand appears to be compatible with all other tablets too.

..

41534996 Covers all of the back, and protects the screen somewhat

..

41534996 I think this case is worth price. I own an otterbox, and I love it, but I wanted something that was lightweight, so I bought this case. I think the case serves its purpose.

..

41534996 Easy to fit, nice looking and protected phone from shocks

..

41534996 A little pricey but a nice case. It's not bulky when on the phone which is really nice.

..

41534996 I like the thin profile and nice fit of this case. Not sure how much protection it offers, but that's the trade off between bulk and security. The belt clip and exterior case work very well and it's easy to grab the phone fast.

..

41534996 This case fits great, feels great, and looks great. It was well worth the money. I like it better than the Speck case I had previously which cracked. This is TPU only in thinner areas which will keep those places from cracking. It is not as sheer as in the photo.

..

41534996 Just bought this for my new iPhone 5s. I had a Belkin case for my last iPhone and loved it so my wife grabbed this one for me. Unfortunately it does not fit the iPhone 5s properly.
It's labeled as "For iPhone 5". The problem is, which iPhone 5? The 5S and 5C are different, a case from one will not properly fit the other. I don't know what Belkin was thinking here, that people would just put up with a badly fitting case and made one that kind of fits both? And I don't know how it got all these positive reviews considering the bad fit I experienced. Try before you buy.

..

41534996 If you spend the money for an IPhone You must invest in one of these to protect your device. It is extremely durable. I like these colors because they don't look grimy like the lighter colors seem to.

..

41534996 Great product! Very durable and good low profile for those that don't like big bulky covers. Has protected the phone several times when i've dropped it.

..

41534996 The case has a nice feel to it but is so soft, the sides don't grip tightly. Works well in your pocket and will protect if flipped on it's face.

..

The patent-pending Airflow Wing allows the fan to pull more air in, so you get better cooling and quieter operation than two-fan designs.Designed for ComfortThe Laptop Cooling Pad's unique design elements help ensure your comfort. The fan is positioned directly under the CPU to pull heat away at the source, while the patented wave shape and Smart Convection design optimize circulation to let hot air flow up and away from your laptop.


..

41534996 This is my 3rd purchase on this cooling pad. The first 2, I thought I was reckless with, so it made me buy it again. It keeps the laptop cool, and does a great job blowing strong air, but does this thing break so fast. Poor quality definitely not worth the money.

..

41534996 Since I purchased this as a deal with buying a laptop, I only used it twice and no more than that. It does not cool off my laptop when it is overheat.

41534996 I purchased two of these laptop fans. One of them has quit after 3 months. The other is still working, but it is not pluged in all the time, because the user says it too loud. The first one has done as all the others have said. It starts making noise, it gets louder, then it stops. The bearings have failed in them and the fan blades have broken. The cooling pad never leaves the desk, so I don't know why they would break. Tonight I have filed a claim with belkin to replace the cooling fan. It seems like a simple return, however, you do have to give credit card info. They will send you the replacement product first, then you send them back you defective one. We'll see how it works out..

..

41534996 this Belkin product was just what we were looking for - it gets our laptop off of the desk and gives it a boost. the fairly quiet fan keeps it cool. We are very pleased with this purchase.

..

41534996 I thought I was the only one who had this fan to break on them. I was looking for a replacement and decided to read the reviews on it. This is when I found out that lots of people were having problems. It does work well for a few months, but if you put any pressure on it in the wrong place it will lock up and the fan becomes useless. It has turned into and ugly lap desk since the fan is broken now. BUYER BEWARE
Don't try to put it in your laptop bag either!

..

41534996 This worked for about 2 days and then then fan stopped working. It works to keep my lap cool but probably does not do much for the laptop without the fan.

..

41534996 I picked this little number up to go with my 11" MBA. It gets the job done, keeps the laptop, and my lap, at a cool temp. The noise is not bad at all from a single fan. Don't be confused, it does make noise though. Don't complain because it isn't silent, it is a fan moving air, after all. And it's not heavy/bulky whether it's on a desk or on my lap on a couch. The only complaint is that there isn't an on/off switch, and it does take up half of my USB ports. But really, that was my choice when I got a laptop with only two ports, no? Decent price and it gets the job done.

..

41534996 This product is really good to cool your laptop--on a table. My laptop has a USB port in the back so when I use it on a table the cord doesn't get in the way. Also, the stand that comes up in the back makes it easier to type.
Now for the big NO that lost it two stars. It is impossible to use while it sits on your lap. Since the intake fan is on the bottom, your legs block the fan while your sitting and it doesn't work. I wish there was one with the intake on the back or with something between the fan and your legs.
Overall, I'm glad I bought it because my laptop has huge heat issues, but anyone whose laptop only gets kind of hot should buy something else.

..

41534996 My laptop has air flow issues where I have it set up so the extra flow from underneath really helps. Cut core temp by about ten degrees. Also puts the laptop on a slight tilt which in my case makes it more comfortable to type.

..

41534996 I purchased my unit just over a year ago to cool my wife's laptop. It did the job spectacularly well but as others have noted, it does not have the ability to adjust the rake, so sometimes the laptop can slide down and this can make cooling less effective. Also, the stand doesn't lock in place, so the unit can end up being placed "flat" and this essentially seals the air inlet for the fan. This, of course, reduces the cooling ability immensely and puts a strain on the fan.
About 2 months ago, the fan began making horrible noises, which I figured meant that the motor or bearings were about to go... and a couple days ago, it finally failed.
I got it on sale, so the price was not too bad, actually. Would I get another one? Yes. Would I pay $30-ish for it? No.
Given where these cooling pads can be put, I'm surprised they last as long as they do. I didn't expect this unit to last this long...
I would recommend this... but I'd explain that a replacement in about a year (or within 2 months when the grinding starts) will be necessary.
At the price I got it for, it's almost cheap enough to be disposable.

Show Off Your New iPhoneA Pop of Color Designed with a fully transparent polycarbonate back that shows off your iPhone and an impact-resistant TPU band around the edges that protects against scratches and dings. The TPU has a bit of flex that feels comfortable in hand and adds a pop of candy-coated color.


..

41534996 I generally like Belkin products but was surprised with the quality of this product. Immediately after 2 days I could see scratches that made my phone look ugly and damaged.
I liked the concept of the case as it shows off the beauty of an iPhone but the quality of this product made me return it in 2 days. Instead bought a Case-Mate Naked Tough case.

..

41534996 This was a disappointing purchase, although it was very inexpensive. I was looking for a clear case, but this one had cloudy patches. The biggest issue, though, was that the rubber edge did not give much and did not have a nice feel. So, all in all, neither attractive nor comfortable. My daughter bought me a glass screen protector, and I'm using that instead.

..

41534996 It offers a great protection. It did get scratches over a period but c'mon it is supposed to do that and save my phone from scratches. No change in color still transparent as ever. I like it !!

..

41534996 I have Iphone 5s n gold so of course I want everyone to see it. I purchased this case recently I like it but...the outter side gets dirty due to usage.

..

41534996 I love the fit, grip and the clear back. Shows off the beauty of my iPhone 5s gold. Serves it's purpose to keep my phone safe from scratches. Definitely recommend this product!

..

41534996 Great case for the price. The case is very sturdy but doesn't add too much weight to the phone. The only two downfalls of the case are that the screen is exposed to possible scratches and the On/Off button takes a little more force to push it due to the stability of the case.

..

41534996 It's a very slim and stylish case that will protect your iPhone from small drops, and normal wear and tear. I love the fact that I can show off the gold back of my iPhone while protecting it from everyday drops.

..

41534996 Fits well. Everything lines up correctly and buttons work easily. Clear back shows off new phone design. Skin just tacky enough so a light grip allows easy control of phone.

..

41534996 Excellent and awesome phone case. Very reliable. It works fine.

..

41534996 I bought the case for my iPhone 5S gold as the case has the transparent part at the back to show the gold color of the iPhone. The case is perfect fit and I love it.

..

41534996 If you need to transfer data fast and easily, this cable is what you need.

..

41534996 i received my item and didn't use it for a while but when i did, i found it very easy to use and hook up

..

41534996 This transfer cable works as advertised. Read the booklet first! I had no trouble with this item.

..

41534996 I used to use the network to transfer data between computers, that took 20 hours or more, purchased this and it was done in less than 2 hours.

..

41534996 I was migrating Windows 7 to Windows 7. It would not let me. Was only for migrating Vista or XP to Win 7. If you need to migrate info to a new computer, it shouldn't matter if it is the same OS!!

..

41534996 Could not get files transfered using this - spent hours trying various suggestions offered by the internet to no avail.

..

41534996 My biggest dread when I got a new computer was all the 'stuff' that needed to be transferred from one tower to another. My husband found this cable and without hurting even a little bit, everything from my Windows XP tower was transferred to my new Windows 7 tower.
Just load the cable software, hook it up and walk away. Easy. We would certainly recommend this to others. Thanks.

..

41534996 it is an excellent tool and makes transfers easy to perform

..

41534996 No more than a day after purchasing this cable, I tried to use it as it was intended to be used: to transfer files. I had Windows XP and the other computer had Windows 7. About 30 minutes into the process, I received numerous error messages which forced me to cancel. Numerous re-attempts were made with no success. Trying to return this cable for a new one prompted a BB employee to tell me it was not returnable, due to some agreement with the manufacturer. Terribly frustating (not even an even exchange could be done). Avoid these cables and buy one from a manufacturer who will actually allow returns if their merchandise is faulty!

..

41534996 I was messing around to get the new computer cloned and finally just went and bought the kit.
Smooth without one glitch. Pretty much never happened with any computer issue. Thank you.

..

41534996 I used this cable as a debug connection to my smartphone and it's the only one that never drop the connection.

..

41534996 The usb cable works great. It was a reasonable price, easy to use, and was more than enough length. I purchased the cable as a replacement. I was very pleased with what I received.

..

41534996 Chap cable used for charging galaxy S3 phone works great. Extra length a plus. Have not tried using it to connect phone to my PC yet so don't know how it works as data cable.

..

41534996 Perfect Cable. Purchased to replace the cable that came with my Galaxy S-II because that cable was only 2-3feet. This cable was double the length and cheap...could not find a cable in my local best buy store with the correct ends. USB to micro is what you need for this phone. So much better to play on phone while charging now because of length. Connects with a "snap". Easy.

..

41534996 This was a perfect replacement to the 3' charging cord that came with the Epic 4G phone. The added length gives me sufficient reach for plug locations on the job and when traveling. The micro USB connector fits snug in the phone and holds tight with no play. Getting this product on sale made it even a bigger bargain.

..

41534996 Horrible. I got this the other day and I plugged my phone in. It worked for about 20 minutes, then I noticed my phone was no longer charging. The only way to get it to work now is to have the phone propped up against something so that the cord is being lifted up slightly.

41534996 I searched for weeks to find a case for the 10.1" Coby tablet which I had received as a gift. I was pleased to find this one. It is sturdy, looks nice, and is priced below similar styles. However, the easel does not have a pivot feature to allow for portrait orientation, which is not of great concern for my purposes. I am very happy with it overall.

Get professional quality results from virtually any photographic original with the Epson Perfection V700 Photo scanner. With ground breaking 6400 dpi resolution, this powerful scanner consistently delivers precision color and detail, whether scanning slides, negatives or medium format film.The Epson Perfection V700 Photo goes one step further. With its Dual Lens System, this innovative product automatically selects from two lenses for the desired scan resolution. Plus, with Digital ICE Technologies, you can easily remove dust and scratches from film, and many types of surface defects from prints, minimizing costly retouching. And, with the convenient film holders included, you can even batch scan multiple slides and negatives to increase productivity.


..

41534996 The SilveFast software is very unfriendly in Windows but is Fantastic on a Mac. BUT! When you get the hang of it it is great for advanced scanning.
The Epson software is the best for automated conversions where pinpoint perfection is not needed.
The scan quality is the absolute best at 9600 giving a 350mb file from a slide! This is TRUE OPTICAL. The detail must be seen to be believed.

..

41534996 This is a great scanner that can handle negatives, slides, as well as general scanning of documents.

..

41534996 I am able to lay x-rays on the screen and outline them and then they scan automatically. I can lay multiple x-rays as many as 20 and they will be captured as individual images. The area is large enough to capture a 8X10 x-ray in good quality. This has solved my problem of archiving older x-rays digitally. I am using the basic Epson software and then importing the images into my office imaging program.

..

41534996 I purchased this to scan my collection of over 4,000 35 mm slides and several thousand photos. Do not use the provided driver software but down load the proper drivers from the company web page. If you do this it will operate just fine. I have scanned 700 slides so far and I am pleased. All the files are in TIF format so that they can be manipulated in the future.

..

41534996 I've used one of these scanners in college multiple times and was very satisfied with the quality of the scans. I scanned 35mm, Medium Format and Large Format film in it and all came out very nice. I used Photoshop to do any necessary post processing but the quality was amazing, was able to print at very very large sizes with all the scans, up to 3 feet with one 35mm scan I believe.
Flatbed scanners will have dust issues of course, keep a microfiber cloth handy to clean everything off but other than that I was very impressed with the quality.
I am ordering mine today from a local Best Buy as I've got about a year worth of film that needs to be scanned!

41534996 Halo combat is an awesome game for pc. the only issue I have with it right now is I can't play. I just bought it 2 weeks ago and after downloading the game it said I can't play cause of it being in safe mode. and even when continuing in safe mode the game will still not play. I need help with this. I know I have a very fast alienware computer and have all the requirements for the game but having issues with it. if anybody can help me please tell me what to do since I can't take it back. overall when I could play it a few years ago it was an awesome game. but I'm guessing windows did something with a security update and now it won't work.

..

41534996 Over all a good game. I mean the graphics weren't very good but this game is older now. Campaign inst as involved as the other Halo's. not as detailled.
Over all though its a great game. I think its worth getting if your going to play the other Halo's.
only thing that really annoyed me was when I got a Wide screen monitor it made the guns and the game look skinny and kinda odd. I don't know if this was just a problem for me. but I don't think this game supports widescreen monitors very well. I mean it runs fine but it looks all skinny. Master chief looks sickly xD.

..

41534996 I bought this game 3 years ago from best buy, and i still play it every chance i get! I have beaten the campaign dozens of times and I'm not sick of it! The graphics are pretty old but still look really good.i think it looks better than Halo 2. Multiplayer is the best Multiplayer I have ever played and NEVER gets old. And it is really easy to run. I have integrated graphics by Intel that cant run anything really, but i get upward of 30 fps with this game. Awesome game! Buy it! Its well worth the $20.
P.S. The Grunts are Hilarious.

..

41534996 There is nothing bad about this game it is incredible the graphics everything and its available for a low price.

..

41534996 Story Line : 5 Stars

41534996 The story is a bit on the short side, lots of maps to see and explore though.
Multiplayer has tons of features from capture the flag to team death match.

..

41534996 One of the best games for the pc but a little too short like a couple levels longer would have made this game even better than it is.The guns,and ai propel this game and got it a 4.9 if it was a tiny bit longer it would have been top dog right with cod4.

..

41534996 best PC game i've ever played!!!! the online is so much fun and tons of people play it!!!!

41534996 I got the printer and set it up. Installed the Drivers off the CD and then plugged in the cable. Turned the printer on and it came up with Error 50.2 Fuser Error. Called HP and they quickly determined that the printer I have is 220 Volt. Called Best Buy and they don't actually sell the printer, but allow other companies to sell on their website. The printer actually came from Buy.com. I looked again at Best Buy's website and did a search on the CP4025, Again two identical printers come up. The SKU is different and so is the price. Other than those two items the listings are identical. I had choose the cheaper one. I am having to return the printer because I don't want to rewire the office just so it can have 220V. Probably ought to have choosen the more expensive one.

..

41534996 Unable to charge phone well with this case on, and I barely use it because of this. I also don't believe it provides
Icy protection. Like the look of it-

..

41534996 Great product. This case fits nice and snug around the iPhone 4S. It was easily installed and provides a fantastic look and feel to the iPhone. Every port is exposed for access. I am able to charge the device without having to take off the case. The only issue I have is that with the case on the sleep/power button is not as easy to push as I would like. I was actually expecting a silicone type material and discovered it is a harder material, which I think provides a little more protection. The holes provide a great grip on the device. The device slides easily in and out of my pocket. Highly recommend if you are looking for a slim case and moderate protection for your iPhone.

..

41534996 Purchase this because the iphone is very slick. This keeps it from sliding around in a vechicle or on a table top or desk. Also provides a good grip when you're holding it.

..

41534996 Great design and lots of grip. It offers better than average protection for the price. Case pricing can be absurd nowadays. I am very rough with it and I have had no problems with the phone being damaged. It feels really good too. Easy to get on and off fast. Mine is starting to flex a little at the top and bottom because I remove it constantly (I only use it when I do outdoor activities).

..

41534996 There are others on the market that fit better, but this is a good one

..

41534996 The case is a very slim and lightweight addition to the phone that does not get in the way of anything, except during charging. The Cut out for the Car Charger to connect is not big enough, so it frequently disconnects, but if you flip off that end, it is fine. An Annoyance, not a biggie.

..

41534996 Bought the case for my 15 year old son and he is very particular, Kudos to the manufacturer, My son loves it. The case itself is light but strong, looks awesome too

..

41534996 I got this because it was on special when I bought my phone. I like the texture and that it is not bulky at all. I also like the non-slip feel of it. This was the most basic color I could find at the Best Buy store I was at. The other options were few and not my style. But I am pretty gentle with my phones and so I went to Amazon and got a pretty case more my style. And also, not black so my phone now stands out more on a table full of smartphones.
I like the case and still have it. I am sure I will switch back when the new one gets beat up.

This iFrogz IP4BRZ-PNK/BLK breeze case features an aerated design for a sleek look and textured feel. Shock-absorbent TPU material helps protect your device while on the go.


..

41534996 I love it!!!,wish the store had more covers for the 4s iPhone

..

41534996 Replaced a cover she got for free and far and away better than the previous. Also it breathes so the phone stays cool

..

41534996 I really like this case!!! Before I had this case, I had a blue otterbox defender case for my iPhone 4 and I like this case better than the otterbox because it is not as thick and bulky. It slides out of pockets very well. I have a white iCarbon skin and a screen protector for my phone and this case fits great. The only problem I have with this case is that the cutouts for the speaker and the mic at the bottom is just a little off but that is probably because of the skin and screen protector. It also has a very cool design. I use this case all the time and it protects my phone very well. I have dropped my iPhone many times and this case protected it. I would mainly recommend this product to somebody who doesn't want to pay much for a case or would not like a big and bulky case.

..

41534996 Got a great deal on this case, and I love the PINK cause I can find it easily in my bag. The only things I don't like are the fact that the pink is only on the back and front of the case but the sides are black (wish it was just pink through and through) and I am not sure that it would protect my phone if I dropped it from any sort of distance.

..

41534996 Like everything about it except I have now gone back to my old case as the case has to be removed to plug the charge cord in completely. So what's the point if you have to remove it to get a reliable charge? Great look, great feel.....poor design

..

41534996 great case to protect phone from dings and scratches

..

41534996 Nice looking case, but will not stay plugged in while charging in the car. It comes unhooked very easily

..

41534996 Another good ifrogz case. I got the pink and black one for my wife. She's not a "pink" kind of girl, but shee is more than happy with it.

..

41534996 This is a good sturdy cover. Needed a temp case for my phone. This is great.

..

41534996 The product is great when you drop your phone it is well protected!

Keep your Apple iPhone 4 or iPhone 4S within reach with this iFrogz ClipStand mobile phone case that features a slip-in belt clip attachment and doubles as a 5-angle stand. The soft-touch coating offers a luxurious feel.


..

41534996 I love this combination case and clip stand. I've tried so many of these that I am confident in saying that for the price, this is the best. Whereas others can be way too tight, making it difficult to extract from the clip stand on the go, this has just the right fit. It does not let go when you don't want it to, but you need not take the whole clip off to get it out. The clip stand works perfectly and accommodates different angles as well as a landscape as well as portrait stance. Very good quality.

..

41534996 I was looking for this for a long time ago, I used to protect my iphone with apples bumpers and carry it in my pocket which was a problem to get the phone when im sitting, I had to stand to get the phone out of my pocket. Also i couldnt carry coins or hard things on that same pocket because of the risk of damaging the iphone.
I was looking for something like a case but not bulky to hold the phone on my belt and free my pocket. This works like a charm. Its lightweight the case is very sleek and good looking.
I would recommend to use a screen protector with this case, however, the iphone screen is made with gorilla glass, which is a lot more resistant to scratches than common glass so maybe the screen protectors are just for peace of mind rather than being useful.

..

41534996 I had been looking awhile for a sleek, slim, lightweight case to carry my IPhone 4 after breaking the one that I had previously, which was discontinued at the AT&T Store.. The case is not cheap, but works really well and is definitely worth the cost. IPhones are a little larger than many other cell phones. This case and holster minimizes the bulk or size, by being lightweight and thin, but very durable and has a very pleasant rubbery smooth finish on both the case and holster. I have only had it for a month, but so far I am very pleased with the case. This type is hard to find; I know because I had been looking for weeks before finding this one at Best Buy.

..

41534996 Love this case and clip because it keeps the phone very close to my body and it is the best I have found.

..

41534996 I prefer to have hard cases for my Apple devices, so I went with a brand I have come to trust in protecting my devices, iFrogz. With the case/holster combination, you get a good snap-on case and a holster that doesn't make the phone too large. I like that you can slide the phone in to either leave the face exposed or protected.
The only drawback of the design is not being able to easily access the dock connector. So when I use my phone in the car or go to charge it at home, I have to remove it from the holster. A better design would have been to go with smaller braces on the sides, but they would have to be strong or possibly cover the speakers in one position and the headphone jack in the other position. Oh, and the belt clip only rotates 180 degrees, also preventing you from taking advantage of every option for positioning the phone to leave the dock connector exposed but still access most features.

..

41534996 Let's consider this case in two parts: the cradle into which the phone installs, and the cover.
The cradle is great, nice feeling texture, not very bulky. For my use, I like it.
Now, the cover. It goes on hard, comes off hard. The first time I withdrew the phone from it, it left a scratch on the screen protector. A few minutes later I took it out again, and there was a circular mark on the screen that lined up with the clip's pivot point.
Really a terrible product. The idea is good, but it really needs work. If you decide to try one, BE SURE YOU HAVE A SCREEN PROTECTOR ON YOUR PHONE!

..

41534996 The Frogz is too tight case and may need to break-in time before it is comfortable to fit and Stand is very flimsy for iPhone to be secure on the hip or belt

..

41534996 Multifunction Case looks good and keeps my iPhone secure. I have received many compliments from co-workers.

Jam to your favorite songs from your mobile phone with these earbud headphones that feature a microphone for clear communication.


..

41534996 These earbuds are AMAZING for the price that i got them for. The moment i put them on i realized how much it feels like im in the concert alone listening to them play. they are comfortable enough to sleep with also. they also include a button that work with my ipod touch 4. literally the best ifrogs product ive ever listened to.

..

41534996 Earphones lasted only two months. The connection where the wire meets the plug shorted out. Poorly designed. Minor wear and tear at that point frays the wire. Avoid.

..

41534996 Considering the price for these earphones, I expected stellar, outstanding performance..NOT the case. My primary phone is an iPhone with a 1st generation DROID as back-up. These plugs rarely work without a lot of jiggling the connection around, pulling it partially out of the jack, and finally resorting to a live, amplified call or listen to movie/music. This is where I should have committed to buying a new Apple set of headphones. For me, it was an unfortunate waste of my 'dosh' (cash in Brit speak). Other than looking 'cool'..they're no good with an iPhone. :')~

..

41534996 for around $20, these can't be beat. Comfortable, and effectively block out noise. I own three pairs.

..

41534996 These headphones constantly fell out of my ear, and when I would put the headphones in my ear; they would make your ears feel if you were miles above the earth on an airplane

..

41534996 First, Best Buy has priced these higher than the $25 I discovered that these really should be. Not good. I bought 2 sets and I returned a pair due to that and the glitch reason posted below.
They are cute and stylish and have decent sound for the most part. You must burn them in to get good sound, it seems. They sound better than the Ozone line I also reviewed. They stay put fine in my small ears. The mic works on phones other than the iPhone.
Now for the bad. These caused glitches on my phones when using Google Voice, ALL of them except I think the iPhone. I verified it was the headset, not the phones. This set dials into Google Voice's voice mail, and/or locks or glitches up the phone after you end a call that went through Google Voice. I even returned a perfectly good phone due to this until I plugged in the headset on a new phone and had the SAME problem. NO OTHER headset has ever done that but these.
I only kept the one pair because it's cute, light and I can use it as a back-up set in case another set breaks. But that glitch is bad. I recommend these, but not if you're using GV.

..

41534996 They may sound OK for phone voice usage, But for music they sound like being in a tin can. Worst earbuds I ever heard.

..

41534996 I've been using them for a while, and the ear pads are not very good. They slide and don't seat the speakers very well.

..

41534996 For me, the ear phones are uncomfortable in my ears. However, if you don't have a problem with the earphones being in your ear, you'll like these.

Plugz are a terrific entry-level ear bud. The powerful 9 mm speaker driver provides above average performance, and is excellent for popular music.

..

41534996 I bought these for my teenage son! He loves the design and the red color on the buds!

..

41534996 for the we price paid, well worth it. very comfortable to wear for periods of time

..

41534996 I love the color and fit of these buds. I was able to get them at a great price as well.

..

41534996 These headphones were not terrible until I started using them daily. Whenever the remote part would run against anything, the song volume would change, or the song would skip/start over/pause. Very frustrating in the gym as well.

..

41534996 This is a great beginner headset for phones. The earbuds are comfortable for the ears and microphone is accessible without distortion.

..

41534996 I thought they'd be comparable to Skullcandy, but so far, it's just not so

..

41534996 Music, phone, movies, games everything sounds great

..

41534996 I liked the sound quality of these headphones and for earbuds, they are semi-comfortable. I've used them daily with my Android phone and everything was great until today. The connection near the headphone jack is very poorly made and they won't last. The audio now cuts in and out. You can't RMA the darn things through the manufacturer anymore because they are no longer listed on their site. Also, the mic on these is very bad and no one can hear you. Don't buy these headphones.

..

41534996 I could have go the more expensive headphones, but for what these are used for I have no real complaint about them at all. They work and that is good enough for me...

..

41534996 Great bass and balanced sound for in ear buds at this price range. Unfortunately the control switch doesn't work very well, and I'm not able to skip forwards/backwards nor reliably control the volume. What ends up happening is I keep pausing the music or it will occasionally skip forward. Perhaps there is a trick to it that I haven't learned, but the controls are not as good as say the Ultimate Ears which I also own.
The sound is actually pretty comparable to the more expensive Ultimate Ears, but the controls are a big negative.

..

41534996 After many months of frustrating research and troubleshooting over sporadic wi-fil loss, this card has been a life-saver. With the original card that my Dell laptop came with, I would have no connectivity at least 1/3 of the time after a startup. The card was fine for maybe a year, but then it kept running into conflicts on boot. I would have to reboot at least 3 times to get it to start. Finally I watched a video on how to replace the card (pretty easy), and then I bought this one. It's been perfect, and I like that it makes use of all 3 wires my laptop has. Just make sure you have a hard-wire availble or some other means to get the drivers.

..

41534996 Overall a great display for the cost. Would buy again for sure.

..

41534996 This monitor has all the features I was looking for. It has a thin bezel with a matte black finish, including the stand. The stand is sturdy, the swivel works well with a turntable built into the base that rotates all the way around. The height adjustment is effortless and works smooth. Tilt has good range and pivot works fine if needed. Buttons have a solid feel and the on light illuminates around the perimeter of the on switch and can be set to shut off during operation. Menu is intuitive and easy to use, and offers a wide range of adjustability. There is no included dvi cable, just a vga cable. It also has no external power brick, rather an internal power supply. It takes about 7 seconds for it to turn on, a little slower than my older monitor. Text is crisp and clear when set to the native resolution of 1680x1050 @ 60hz. Viewing angles are real good both side to side and up and down, however there is some substantial light bleed from the bottom up. Something unique about this monitor is the aspect ratio. Its 16x10, and has a bit more viewing area than another 22 monitor at 16x9. Also, this monitor is a Canadian model, as it is not listed on the LG site for U.S., but it can be found at LG/Canada. I looked around for a monitor for a long time before I decided on this one. Considering the price and all the features, it still seems like a good monitor to me.

6006840500004 The item is poorly made and over priced. The best thing was best buys shipping. I had to exchange it once and they sent me a new one right away but the second one was the same.

..

6006840500004 The case is beautiful and unique. Adds no bulkiness to my phone. Just remove the back cover to the phone and add this piece in it's place. Unfortunately, the front cover has a shiny, mirror-like coating on it that scratches easily and also shows dirt. Also, you must fold this cover back to take a phone call. This isn't a problem except the case isn't meant to be bent in this way. The front and back cover are only connected by a thin piece of foam. The foam began to separate from the front cover quickly and now I am afraid to use the case because I feel like it will just fall apart. For such an expensive case I'd expect better quality.

6006840500004 I bought this on sale and am really happy with it. The back of the case fits very well without adding bulk and it has a great overall look. I am able to take pictures through the clear front very easily when it is opened and folded to the back. I've dropped the phone a few times with the case on it and it has protected the screen well, but the interior of the case has sustained a scratch due to one fall. The clear case is easily cleaned. It is a very nice case.

6006839540003 I chose this case for my new iPad as it mimics the shape and functionality of the original iPad black rubber case I have on our old one. Well, it's a bit subpar for the price.

It's weak and when placed in the back holder to sit the iPad as an easel, it just doesn't hold it up sturdy or stay in the back clasp well.
Pretty to look at but not as functional as I expected.

6006839540003 I purchased this case because I wanted something inexpensive to protect my kid's ipad. I was mainly focused on price and wanted the feature that would allow them to prop up the ipad at an angle to watch movies or play games. Great purchase. They love the elephants too!

..

6006839540003 I liked it because it's pretty and fit perfectly on my iPad

..

6006839540003 The cover is cute and offers good protection to my ipad, but is very stiff, which makes it difficult to use as a stand. I'm hoping that as I use it, it will loosen up a bit. Overall - I'm happy with the purchase.

..

6006839540003 Love the cover for what it is, but if you want to be able to fold the front cover back I don't recommend it.

..

6006839540003 I gave this as a Christmas gift to accompany the iPad that I gave my granddaughter. Reports from her parents are positive.

..

6006839540003 This is easy to put on and remove as necessary, provides excellent protection and holds the tablet securely, wearing very well

..

6006839540003 When something is light colored it gets dirty easily.

..

6006839540003 This is just the cutest case! Everyone that I work with just loves it. The only thing that I don't like is the light color shows all the dirt.

..

6006839540003 Bought this for my sons IPAD and it is protecting it and working perfectly

..

6006839540003 Offers great protection and very well made not from china.

..

6006839540003 I was skeptical about ordering this online because of the reviews but I just got it today and I love it!!! It's cute, it fits like a glove and it gives good protection! Very happy with my decision to purchase this :)

..

6006839540003 Ignore the negative review before mine because i have no clue what that person was talking about. I was actually skeptical of buying this product after reading their review but I went ahead and purchased the case anyways and it absolutely fits the ipad mini perfectly. I have had NO issues with it being difficult to get to buttons. Also it sits up perfectly fine with no hassle. All around its a great product and I am very pleased with it. And on the plus side its on sale!

..

6006839540003 I thought this case was cute but after trying to use it I decided to return it to Best Buy. It seemed like it just didn't fit very well, it was very stiff and the buttons were hard to get to with it on. Also, when I tried to stand it up like its supposed to, the entire case and Ipad would just flip over so I didn't feel comfortable using it. I was scared the Ipad would just fall off if it was sitting on a table or counter. I didn't think it was worth the fourty dollars i spent on it.

Protect your iPad on the go with this Griffin Technology Moxy Python GB35486 folio case that features a microsuede lining to guard against damage. The case converts into a 3-position stand for comfortable viewing in an upright or inclined position.


..

6006839540003 I like the color combo. Its definitely easy to spot in a room.

..

6006839540003 Loved the color and durability of the cover. Great buy for the price!

..

6006839540003 Bought this for my little girl (18) to protect her iPad.
She loves the texture and colors. Red outside and gold inside.
The cover offers the usual two position options: upright for watching videos or laying at an angle to allow for easy typing.
The iPad fits very snugly and most of the buttons, switches and ports are easily accessible. I use a third party cable that apparently is slightly larger at the 30 pin end so it does not seat in all the way, but still charges the iPad.
Like the touch of adding a loop where you can secure a pen to the cover.
Overall a very good cover with good finishes. The stitching is well done and it feels solid.
Another small note: the corners are not covered, but does protrude a bit, so if you drop it on a corner the iPad may suffer some damage.

..

6006839540003 Great looking case same color as my cell phone and other business items,but it holds everything in place securely.

..

6006839540003 I've had it a couple months. I take it EVERYWHERE. Plane, car, work. It still looks brand new, plus it's easy to get the iPad in and out for cleaning. Being a seamstress, I look for things like stitching. it is made very well, and I expect it to hold up for quite some time.

..

6006839540003 We have a case with a keyboard built in but sometimes do not need to take it where we are going so we bought this case for its light weight. It was only after we used it to take photos that we noticed the problem. We have and iPad 3rd generation which it says the case will accommodate.

..

6006839540003 My review is rated excellent. I love it.
5 stars, I have 2 other ipad cases and really wanted to buy another one of those but decided to get this one. I am so glad I did and the price is very affordable.

..

6006839540003 This case of the iPad has a luxury look. Has a leather texture on the outside. Even the teenage group have given compliments on its appearance. Seems durable.

..

6006839540003 We used up our first cover ( a basic ) and needed something more substantial. This is light weight, sturdy and my wife likes the looks.
Reasonably priced for a cover of this quality.

..

6006839540003 I like using my IPad inside my case . Feels secure and easier to handle.

Safeguard your iPad mini with this Griffin Technology Moxy Python GB36129 folio case that holds your device in place for secure protection. The case converts into a 2-position stand for comfortable upright or inclined landscape viewing.


..

6006839540003 Got this when I bought the iPad mini. I had bought just a screen cover earlier, but that does not protect the back of the iPad from scratches. This cover protects both the front and back and has a holder for a stylus (which I have found is easier for me to use than just finger touch). The workmanship is good. I believe this will be very durable. The only drawback is that it adds weight to the iPad mini, making it tiresome to hold for long periods, but the back side cover can me folded into a convenient stand, so that helps.

..

6006839540003 This was one of the few cases available at Best Buy on the day I bought my iPad mini. I will most likely look for a different case that is lighter weight and easier to use to prop up the iPad for reading, etc.

..

6006839540003 I wish I had checked for reviews on the site before purchasing this item in store, because the previous reviewer is absolutely correct that this case covers too much of the screen and it is difficult to type or select any buttons near the left or right edge. I will be returning this case to the store immediately.

..

6006839540003 I picked this up the first morning I got my ipad mini from best buy. I will be returning it.
It does not fit the screen face, overlapping on the edges, so if you have any icons that are close to the edge, you can't get to them.
It does not fit properly and buldges at the bottom and top.
No magnetic latch, so it will not turn off your ipad.

The No. 2 Pencil: you grew up with it. It was your colleague-in-learning during some of the brightest (and perhaps most trying) moments of your academic career. Now, in the age of smartphones, tablets, and touchscreens, the No. 2 Pencil is still there for you. As a stylus. Like any good stylus, Griffin's No. 2 Pencil Stylus gives you more than just fingertip control as you write, sketch, tap and gesture on your iPad, iPhone, or other touchscreen. The soft rubber tip is designed to mimic your finger, but, unlike your finger, it keeps your touchscreen free of fingerprints and smudges. As a faithful reproduction of the classic yellow pencil, Griffin's No. 2 Pencil Stylus confers unexpected benefits: Its shape, length, and weight provide natural balance and a familiar writing feel not found in shorter, lighter styluses. (And the hexagonal cross-section won't roll off your desk.) You'll find this newfound old faithful friend perfect for sketching, drawing, editing photography, flight simulator apps and games (or, dare we say it... taking exams?) ...any use for which you need a finer degree of control than your fingertip. And it looks right at home in your pocket protector.

6006839540003 I think they should sell them in a 12 pack, so when it breaks you have spares.

Protector: Stealthy protection for your iPhone 5. And everything in it.Like a velvet glove wrapped around a gold brick.Which we think is a pretty apt description.

A rich matte finish on the exterior is easy to grip. Protector is custom molded for a precise fit, with cutouts for access to controls, headphone jack and Lightning connector.

Let (almost) nothing come between you and your iPhone.Reveal's sleek, one-piece design lets the beauty of your iPhone shine through, even as it shields your iPhone from the indignities of the outside world.

Remember the slap bracelet? Remember how much fun it was? We've brought it back. We've wrapped a memory-metal wristband with soft silky silicone. Slap's flexible, spring-steel band lies flat and rigid until you slap! it onto your arm. Snap Slap open, then snap Slap shut around your wrist. (Say that 10 times real fast.) The Slap band self-adjusts to a comfortable fit, exactly your size.For your iPod, we've equipped Slap with a generous frame of silicone that holds your iPod securely and shrugs off bumps and jolts. Slap protects the dock connector and volume controls but leaves the headphone port open so you can plug in and listen any time. Speaking of time, you can press the Sleep/Wake button through the frame to check the time or control iTunes. The watch face display of your iPod nano turns Slap into a fun, handy classic timepiece. Your iPod nano plus our Slap wristband case-together they create the most useful and entertaining wristwatch your arm has ever seen.


..

6006839540003 I was really looking forward to my purchase but have been disappointed in the challenge to place the nano in the case and then the frequency of the music getting dropped. I'm guessing it is because of the rubber covering the operating selection and volume buttons.

..

6006839540003 I returned this wristband. It was extremely difficult to get the nano into it (felt like I was going to damage the nano in the process), and you have to remove the nano from band in order to charge it. I did not want to struggle with this every time I needed to charge. I bought the Belkin Flexware Sport watchband which is easy to use. The Belkin doesn't provide as much protection as this Griffin style, but its ease of use makes it preferable to me. I have been using the Belkin band when I go to the gym and am very happy with it.

..

6006839540003 Couldn't insert my I-pod. Went back to the store and salesperson couldn't either. If, by chance, you can get your I-pod into the darn thing, you have to remove it to charge the battery. POOR IDEA FOR SOMETHING THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A GOOD THING.

..

6006839540003 Much more comfortable than the typical wrist band. I have a small wrist and this is a perfect fit! Similar to the old slap band.

..

6006839540003 I've had this product for 2 days and I am planning to return it tomorrow. It felt a bit like the Best Buy Associate rushed me into purchasing this product. I had already decided to purchase an 16G ipod nano and this accessory was like an afterthought.
It's hurts my wrist, it makes my ipod shut off, which is especially irritating because I'm using it to track my steps. And to top it all off, someone joked it looks like a house arrest bracelet, haha. Also, it is tricky trying to take it out and put it back to charge it.
I wish I read the reviews first before purchasing this product. Maybe if it was around $11-15, I wouldn't complain that much; but for nearly $30 the quality could be a lot better.

..

6006839540003 I like the idea of the slap band, however, for some reason, when I move my arm, the band causes the i-pod to shut off, so I can't use it for any type of activity. Also, I have a hard time getting my Bose head pones to stay in the hole because the rubber is so thick.

..

6006839540003 It is a pretty good product. Only reason I did not give it a five is the look. It can be a littke bulky, but it grows on you. It is also pretty good during exercise doesn't get real wet and stays put.

..

6006839540003 I would definitely not recommend this product, ESPECIALLY for the price. While I was initially drawn to it because it protected the ENTIRE iPod (metal exterior included), it is extremely difficult and awkward to get the iPod in and out of the case (which leads to wear and tear of the product) without pressing a ton of buttons.
And this is a more subjective complaint, but the wristband is very uncomfortable to wear (especially if you have bony wrists) - I usually just keep the entire case around a belt loop or in my purse instead of wearing it because of this reason.
I intend to write to the company and request a refund, because I am extremely dissatisfied with this product and would pick up a different one in a heartbeat.

..

6006839540003 This band looks great, but is not functional. My wife tried 4 different head phones and none would stay in the Ipod due to the thickness of the band and size at the headphone hole. I finally tried cutting the hole bigger, but it still would not allow the headset plugs to stay. In addition, you have to remove the Ipod every time you need to recharge.
My wife threw the band away after 4 days of trying.

..

6006839540003 I think it is a pretty good product...... first it looks a little bulky but that's okay........ second it will leave some of your ipods paint color showing so only get this one if your ipod is blue. Lasty it will start to rip on the edeges after about a month of use......I lied this is last.......overall its a good product and not bad for the price and its a little hard to get in and out of the case.

My wife threw the band away after 4 days of trying.

..

6006839540003 I think it is a pretty good product...... first it looks a little bulky but that's okay........ second it will leave some of your ipods paint color showing so only get this one if your ipod is blue. Lasty it will start to rip on the edeges after about a month of use......I lied this is last.......overall its a good product and not bad for the price and its a little hard to get in and out of the case.

Remember the slap bracelet? Remember how much fun it was? We've brought it back. We've wrapped a memory-metal wristband with soft silky silicone. Slap's flexible, spring-steel band lies flat and rigid until you slap! it onto your arm. Snap Slap open, then snap Slap shut around your wrist. (Say that 10 times real fast.) The Slap band self-adjusts to a comfortable fit, exactly your size.For your iPod, we've equipped Slap with a generous frame of silicone that holds your iPod securely and shrugs off bumps and jolts. Slap protects the dock connector and volume controls but leaves the headphone port open so you can plug in and listen any time. Speaking of time, you can press the Sleep/Wake button through the frame to check the time or control iTunes. The watch face display of your iPod nano turns Slap into a fun, handy classic timepiece. Your iPod nano plus our Slap wristband case-together they create the most useful and entertaining wristwatch your arm has ever seen.


..

6006839540003 I was really looking forward to my purchase but have been disappointed in the challenge to place the nano in the case and then the frequency of the music getting dropped. I'm guessing it is because of the rubber covering the operating selection and volume buttons.

..

6006839540003 I returned this wristband. It was extremely difficult to get the nano into it (felt like I was going to damage the nano in the process), and you have to remove the nano from band in order to charge it. I did not want to struggle with this every time I needed to charge. I bought the Belkin Flexware Sport watchband which is easy to use. The Belkin doesn't provide as much protection as this Griffin style, but its ease of use makes it preferable to me. I have been using the Belkin band when I go to the gym and am very happy with it.

..

6006839540003 Couldn't insert my I-pod. Went back to the store and salesperson couldn't either. If, by chance, you can get your I-pod into the darn thing, you have to remove it to charge the battery. POOR IDEA FOR SOMETHING THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A GOOD THING.

..

6006839540003 Much more comfortable than the typical wrist band. I have a small wrist and this is a perfect fit! Similar to the old slap band.

..

6006839540003 I've had this product for 2 days and I am planning to return it tomorrow. It felt a bit like the Best Buy Associate rushed me into purchasing this product. I had already decided to purchase an 16G ipod nano and this accessory was like an afterthought.
It's hurts my wrist, it makes my ipod shut off, which is especially irritating because I'm using it to track my steps. And to top it all off, someone joked it looks like a house arrest bracelet, haha. Also, it is tricky trying to take it out and put it back to charge it.
I wish I read the reviews first before purchasing this product. Maybe if it was around $11-15, I wouldn't complain that much; but for nearly $30 the quality could be a lot better.

..

6006839540003 I like the idea of the slap band, however, for some reason, when I move my arm, the band causes the i-pod to shut off, so I can't use it for any type of activity. Also, I have a hard time getting my Bose head pones to stay in the hole because the rubber is so thick.

..

6006839540003 It is a pretty good product. Only reason I did not give it a five is the look. It can be a littke bulky, but it grows on you. It is also pretty good during exercise doesn't get real wet and stays put.

..

6006839540003 I would definitely not recommend this product, ESPECIALLY for the price. While I was initially drawn to it because it protected the ENTIRE iPod (metal exterior included), it is extremely difficult and awkward to get the iPod in and out of the case (which leads to wear and tear of the product) without pressing a ton of buttons.
And this is a more subjective complaint, but the wristband is very uncomfortable to wear (especially if you have bony wrists) - I usually just keep the entire case around a belt loop or in my purse instead of wearing it because of this reason.
I intend to write to the company and request a refund, because I am extremely dissatisfied with this product and would pick up a different one in a heartbeat.

One of the more hands-down useful inventions for athletes, or, indeed, for active people everywhere, is the absorbent terrycloth wristband. Griffin's found a way to improve on it, by having it include a snap-in holder for your iPod nano (7th generation). Clip your iPod nano into the molded polycarbonate holder on Griffin's SportCuff. Plug in your earphone and you're ready to hit the track with your favorite portable media player; FM radio; pedometer; the most versatile wristwatch, ever; and even Nike fitness options. All in a sweat-absorbent wristband that keeps your iPod nano securely in place and always handy.


..

6006839540003 Lightweight and holds the Nano very well. Your able to wipe the sweat from your face. Washing is difficult (hand wash) and is starting to look tattered. But it still holds the Nano well, which is the most important thing, right?

..

6006839540003 This product solved my problem of having to hold my ipod while exercising with a slip on comfortable holder that i put on my forearm. It is also very comfortable, affordable, and i can now enjoy my ipod and exercise.

..

6006839540003 It's is good but easily to loose if you keep stretch

..

6006839540003 I like the sport cuff for my iPod Nano because it's definitely convenient for when I go to the gym to work out. It's easy to use, but does get a little tight around the wrist after a while wearing it.

..

6006839540003 Good wristband for anyone who is active and on the go.

..

6006839540003 Great iPod holder for active people, really everyone!

..

6006839540003 I like this product for the mere fact that I can exercise and not worry about what to do with my iPod. At the same time, I hate how it irritates my skin when I get sweaty, etc. Still, it gets the job done.

..

6006839540003 On clearance when bought, so value was great. Holds iPod nano with no problems. A little tight at first, but after use, it fit fine.

..

6006839540003 I bough this to go along with my Bluetooth headphones when I exercise. It's great! It holds on tightly to my iPod so i don't have to worry about. The band stays in place. Yes, it gets sweaty, but it is a SportCuff! It's better than an armband in my opinion. I can access my iPod a lot easier from my wrist than from my upper arm.

..

6006839540003 When I bought this, I thought it would be a convenient way to have both a sweat band (while working out) and a holder for my Nano. The sweat band is kind of tight, so I don't use it very much. I don't know how well it would have lasted thru frequent washings.

Ridiculously over-engineered? Or the perfect case for your iPhone 3G no matter where you're headed?We think it's a little bit of both.Simply put, the Griffin Extreme Duty Case is the most protective case we've ever built.Tested to meet or exceed US Department of Defense Standard 810F and UK Department of Defense Standard 00-35, Griffin's Survivor Extreme-Duty Case is designed from the inside out to protect your iPhone from extreme conditions ... dirt, sand, rain, shock, vibration and a host of other environmental factors.Survivor is built on a shatter-resistant polycarbonate frame clad in rugged, shock absorbing silicone. A built-in screen protector seals your Multi-Touch display from the outside environment, with hinged plugs that seal the dock connector, headphone port, hold switch and volume controls. A detachable heavy-duty clip secures your iPhone to a belt or bag strap.


..

6006839540003 It is a little bulky, but that's ok as long as it protects the phone. Its an otterbox so its a good product. Bought from best buy of course. I would recommend this item. Especially if you drop your phone as much I have in the past.

..

6006839540003 My wife uses the phone case daily. It's kind of bulky but very durable and protects the phone well.

..

6006839540003 Really the only thing I have to say that I do not like is the flap for the camera lense is a pain to open. If your in a rush to take a picture you will miss it.

..

6006839540003 the best case i ever had, i droped my phone several times and nothing hapen to it

..

6006839540003 This case is a good case to protect your phone. The belt clip though tends to lock open. But overall, this is the best case that i have had for my phone.

..

6006839540003 It is a great case and is wonderful to protect against accidental drops and falls.

..

6006839540003 Well, what can one say about a cell phone case? This case does what it is meant to do. Protects from impact, rain/spills, and 2-year olds.
The only complaint would be that it is too bulky to fit in a pocket most times. This means you will need those protective qualities because there is an increase in the probability that you will drop it/get it wet/taken by a 2-year old.
Is it pricey? Yes, but you don't mind missing a meal or two, do you?

..

6006839540003 Great case. It's just a bit too chunky and bulky for pockets.

..

6006839540003 I would buy again and encourage others to purchase.

..

6006839540003 Excellent protection for the phone, hard to get access to various ports and switches on phone.

..

..

6006839540003 I really like this case because it is very durable and has a built in screen. However as a result it's much heavier and bulkier, harder to fit in a pocket. I must stress that it is not waterproof!

..

6006839540003 Purchased on sale at Best Buy. Offers GREAT protection. I would definitely buy another. Ports and camera are relatively easy to access.

..

6006839540003 Very good product and great value! I especially like that it's waterproof.

..

6006839540003 Was cheap, should have let me know from the start it wasn't for me. When on the belt clip, it leaves the phone screen facing the front. That is a stupid design. Then it makes you sound muffled when you are talking to someone.

..

6006839540003 Good case,but it makes the phone too big to fit in your pocket

..

6006839540003 its durable, keeps phone safe, but hard to use the added features on the iPhone5s with its attached camera cover, the covered thumb-button and hard to open volume control.

..

6006839540003 don't like the moisture that gathers between the zagg shield on my phone and the shield that comes with the case

..

6006839540003 If you don't work in an office and do a lot of walking this is the one for you. Not good in pocket but in its clip it's secure.

..

6006839540003 Great product. Works fantastic. Would purchase again.

..

6006839540003 Great protection for my iPhone. It was very reasonably priced which made it even more appealing. It has a built in screen saver as well. My wife has a LifeProof case but I think this one is almost as good; just a bit bulkier...

6006839540003 I really like this case because it is very durable and has a built in screen. However as a result it's much heavier and bulkier, harder to fit in a pocket. I must stress that it is not waterproof!

..

6006839540003 Purchased on sale at Best Buy. Offers GREAT protection. I would definitely buy another. Ports and camera are relatively easy to access.

..

6006839540003 Very good product and great value! I especially like that it's waterproof.

..

6006839540003 Was cheap, should have let me know from the start it wasn't for me. When on the belt clip, it leaves the phone screen facing the front. That is a stupid design. Then it makes you sound muffled when you are talking to someone.

..

6006839540003 Good case,but it makes the phone too big to fit in your pocket

..

6006839540003 its durable, keeps phone safe, but hard to use the added features on the iPhone5s with its attached camera cover, the covered thumb-button and hard to open volume control.

..

6006839540003 don't like the moisture that gathers between the zagg shield on my phone and the shield that comes with the case

..

6006839540003 If you don't work in an office and do a lot of walking this is the one for you. Not good in pocket but in its clip it's secure.

..

6006839540003 Great product. Works fantastic. Would purchase again.

..

6006839540003 Great protection for my iPhone. It was very reasonably priced which made it even more appealing. It has a built in screen saver as well. My wife has a LifeProof case but I think this one is almost as good; just a bit bulkier...

..

6006839540003 At first, I wasn't a fan of this product. I didn't like how it covered the color of my iPod, and how it wasn't easy to put on my iPod. It has grown on me since it has done a really good job of protecting my iPod from my 2 small children. I have dropped it and so have they, and it has not gotten scratched or broken. I don't keep the screen protector on, because it made the iPod more difficult to use, but I will use the screen protector when I take my iPod to the beach. I would tell someone that buys this product to remember to take the camera cover off before taking pics. Sometimes I forget that there is a protective cover on it and think that my iPod's camera is broken.

..

6006839540003 Sturdy and pretty. I highly recommend this product.

Outfit your Apple iPad mini in rugged protection with this Griffin Technology Survivor GB36291 case that features a rigid internal frame to guard against bumps and drops and an integral display shield that deflects wind and rain.


..

6006839540003 helps protect the i pad especially when small children use it

..

6006839540003 Great protection for my daughter ipad. Durable and with stand drops.

..

6006839540003 Purchased his along with an iPad mini; seems to be well constructed.

..

6006839540003 We bought this cover for my son's Ipad mini. It is very durable and offers great protection providing piece of mind in the event of a drop th Ipad is safe.

..

6006839540003 Love this product have it in blu and black for my kids devices

..

6006839540003 Overall, this is a good product. It provides great protection and is a great fit for the iPad Mini. My only complaint is that the sound is muffled slightly when playing music.

..

6006839540003 This is perfect for our two year old. Very durable!

..

6006839540003 This is a good substitute for a otterbox at half the price. Could use a full frontal cover like otterbox for maximum coverage.

..

6006839540003 not crazy about the plastic lens over the screen, but it is durable and does its job

..

6006839540003 provides great protection to my ipad, love the snap in screen protector. All in all a great purchase. Highly recommended.

..

6006839540003 
Safeguard your Apple iPhone 4 or 4S with this Griffin Technology Survivor GB35357-2 case that features an integrated screen shield to protect your phone's display. The removable clip attaches to your belt for secure device transportation.


..

6006839540003 It is a little bulky, but that's ok as long as it protects the phone. Its an otterbox so its a good product. Bought from best buy of course. I would recommend this item. Especially if you drop your phone as much I have in the past.

..

6006839540003 My wife uses the phone case daily. It's kind of bulky but very durable and protects the phone well.

..

6006839540003 Really the only thing I have to say that I do not like is the flap for the camera lense is a pain to open. If your in a rush to take a picture you will miss it.

..

6006839540003 the best case i ever had, i droped my phone several times and nothing hapen to it

..

6006839540003 This case is a good case to protect your phone. The belt clip though tends to lock open. But overall, this is the best case that i have had for my phone.

..

6006839540003 It is a great case and is wonderful to protect against accidental drops and falls.

..

6006839540003 Well, what can one say about a cell phone case? This case does what it is meant to do. Protects from impact, rain/spills, and 2-year olds.
The only complaint would be that it is too bulky to fit in a pocket most times. This means you will need those protective qualities because there is an increase in the probability that you will drop it/get it wet/taken by a 2-year old.
Is it pricey? Yes, but you don't mind missing a meal or two, do you?

..

6006839540003 Great case. It's just a bit too chunky and bulky for pockets.

..

6006839540003 I would buy again and encourage others to purchase.

..

6006839540003 Excellent protection for the phone, hard to get access to various ports and switches on phone.

..

Easily carry your Apple iPhone 5 with this Griffin Technology Survivor GB37511 case that features a detachable clip for attachment to a belt or pack strap. The hinged plugs seal your device's ports to help keep out dust and dirt.


..

6006839540003 Had an Otterbox cover on my old phone, but came across this case at a discounted price. Cover is very durable, and the belt clip is nice. However, to get to the charging port on the phone or the camera lens, the belt clip needs to be removed. Not a big deal, but inconvenient at times.

..

6006839540003 we like it - i would buy it again. we bought 4 survivor products that day!

..

6006839540003 cover didnt let the power button work at all!
not good

..

6006839540003 
Shield your Apple iPhone 5 from impact-based shock with this Griffin Technology Survivor GB37470 case that features a play-through design for full access to your device's features. The molded edges fit comfortably in your hand for a secure grip.


..

6006839540003 This item is probably only LIGHT DUTY protection. TOO easy to get on and off. I like the color - the blue is awesome!

..

6006839540003 This is a fairly cut and dry issue. Do you drop your phone? Does it shatter around the corner? If cracking your phone around the corner is an issue for you, this will really help.
It's a bit big and bulky and uncomfortable in your pocket (although, great in a purse) . However, it does an outstanding job of protecting the corners of your phone. If that's an issue for you, this could be very helpful.
As with all mobile cases, this product is ridiculously overpriced for what's essentially a sheet of plastic with some rubber around the corners, but that's kind of par for the course with cases for mobile devices.

..

6006839540003 Don't buy it. It looks good but, the case design is off especially on Volume buttons.

..

6006839540003 The helpful young man at Best Buy originally gave me this case in error and exchanged it for one that fit my device.

..

6006839540003 I needed a new case to keep my phone safe, this one has been by far the best case i have ever owned.

..

6006839540003 Love the case. Durable. Cute. Perfect if you are like me and drop things. Great protection for my expensive phone.

How protective is Survivor Clear? We asked the Military. It looks like your iPod touch is wearing nothing at all. But, in a Survivor Clear case, you'll know your iPod is protected from drops - even on hard pavement. Survivor Clear is crystal-clear polycarbonate married to tough, resilient TPE rubber at edges and corners, to give your iPod impact protection where it needs it most. And holding it feels great, thanks to a slightly curved silhouette.  And is it tough? Oh yeah.  Shock/Drop Test: We repeatedly dropped a Survivor Clear-clad iPOd touch on a concrete floor from a height of 6 ft (that's higher than you will probably ever drop it from while standing) Vibration: We subjected Survivor and iPod touch to 18 hoursrs of bone-shaking vibration, from 20 to 2000 cycles per second (imagine leaving your iPod on the floor of your car all day while you negotiate under-construction roads at top speed)  In both tests, Survivor Clear delivered. Will your iPod in a Survivor Clear case ever have to withstand the conditions in our tests? Probably not. But, if Survivor performs this well in our tests, imagine your peace of mind every time you accidentally drop your iPod.


..

6006839540003 This skin is easier to hold than some others that I have tried. Protects my iPod from scratches and dings nicely.

6006839540003 Fits and protects well. Good case for the money. Would recommend

6006839540003 Works great easy to use and comes with a protective shield

..

6006839540003 Really liked this cover. Selected it because my son has gone through three different iTouch covers and the plastic ones black and the gorilla ones are hard to press the surface with my large fingers. This one does the job!

..

6006839540003 I just need something to cover my device. It offers everything I need in a cover for and easily screen cracking device. So far I have sat it in my lap in the car and forgot went to step out and it fell and my device in still in tact.

..

6006839540003 Bought it for my son, it def protects the iPod which I love, however it doesn't fit perfectly.

Designed and tested to meet or exceed US Department of Defense Standard 810F, Griffin's Survivor Extreme-Duty Case is designed from the inside out to protect your iPad from extreme conditions ... dirt, sand, rain, shock, vibration, and a host of other environmental factors. Survivor is built on a shatter-resistant polycarbonate frame clad in rugged, shock absorbing silicone. A built-in screen protector seals your Multi-Touch display from the outside environment, while hinged plugs seal the dock connector, headphone port, hold switch, camera, and volume controls.


..

6006839540003 I usually don't give bad reviews, but this product was a waste of money. It didn't fit on my ipad correctly and it just seemed flimsy. Wasn't made well either. Dissapointed.

..

6006839540003 This is a good sturdy product. The iPad is well protected and safe from any drops,etc. it has a nice smooth front for the touch screen and works well thru the layers, no problems. Would recommend this.

..

6006839540003 A good product. Just didn't work for us to thick ..took back and purchased another product

..

6006839540003 The black case is very durable but doesn't look clunky. I can take it to work and then let my kids use it without fear the will crack the screen or spill something on it. It protects the screen and body keeping it as nice as the first day you bought it!

..

6006839540003 I purchased this on sale and it's holding up very well. The stand is a little hard to open sometimes but it works well. The screen cover isn't as clear as I'd like it to be. Overall, it's a good purchase if you're looking for a basic protective cover for your iPad.

..

6006839540003 I bought this for my mom when she upgraded to the iPad Air. It's ok. Offers great protection!! Only downfalls are weight, as with any good case, and where the charger plugs in is always loose when the charger is not plugged in. I guess you could call it flimsy.

..

6006839540003 So the case itself is five star excellent. The rubber cushioned corners are a cut above the Otterbox case, which does not seem to have the same level of cushioning for falls that the Survivor has (and which I had in my hand the other day for comparison). The buttons are easy to press with the built-in buttons in the case. This is not a sissy case made for people obsessed with having their slim, 1 pound iPad Airs still be slim and weighing 1 pound. It doubles the thickness and almost the weight (I believe the case weighs 0.7 lbs). It is, however, a very tough case with a clever stand that you can leave on or take off. The rubber also makes it considerably easy to grip (a step up from the Otterbox in this regard). The stand can be used in the more vertical or more horizontal angled position, determined by how you lay it. I didn't realize this until after I bought it (and was glad to discover it could do the ~30 degree angle as well as the ~60 degree angled position). There is nothing in the case to protect the screen from a direct hit - just a screen protector that keeps your screen from getting scuffed up (the Otterbox has a hefty, removable lid that doubles as a stand). But, please don't be like one of the reviewers I read online that whined about the screen protector scratching up their screen. The only thing that can scratch your screen is the dirt you leave on it before putting the Survivor's screen protector against the glass. Clean the glass perfectly (shelter it from dust until it's in the case) and you will have no problems with it. My only complaint is that the built-in screen protector has the appearance of a faint oil slick on the screen (with faint rainbow-colored swirls all over). Since water protection is not all that important to me, I plan to just cut off the built-in screen protector and replace it with a regular one that attaches directly to the screen. As for water protection, this case covers everything quite well, including the speakers, microphones, and camera, though the speakers are quite loud, the microphones don't seem limited, and the camera is still accessible. While I wouldn't submerge the case on purpose or take a shower with it, I wouldn't be worried about using the iPad in the rain. The only part of the iPad that isn't fully covered is the camera on the screen side of the device, and the case is so tight up against the face of the iPad around the camera that I'd be very surprised if water would be able to squeeze in there. The ear phone jack and power / USB port and side switch are all covered with easily flipped open flaps (that seem water tight). The main camera flap is the only awkward flap on the case. It doesn't seem quite natural pulling it then rotating it out of the way of the camera to use, but that is the way it is made. The Otterbox, on the other hand, offers no meaningful water protection, but the camera is never covered, either. Decide for yourself which features are most important to you and buy accordingly. The Survivor and Otterbox are both excellent, protective cases.
One last thing: For whatever reason, they stick the directions for the case inside of the sealed case in the box. You need the directions to open it. So, just do a Youtube search and you can find a couple of videos that show you how to open it.

..

6006839540003 This was easy to use and install in on the iPad! It was expensive but well worth it for the protection.

..

6006839540003 sales man showed me what exactally what I needed and it was right

..

6006839540003 The survivor case has always been the top quality brand for people who live a rough life, the case meets military standards, it can withstand a lot of natures elements.

No case can protect your iPod if you can't carry it with you. That's why Griffin made Survivor Skin. Survivor Skin is extra-thick silicone cladding that wraps protectively around your iPod, yet is slim enough in profile to fit easily in and out of your pocket. Survivor Skin's durable silicone protects the back, sides and edges of your iPod from impacts and vibration. The smooth, matte textured exterior is easy to grip, and custom molded for a precise fit. A molded interior provides extra shock absorption. Edge cutouts provide access to controls, headphone jack and dock connector, and raised button covers keep grit and moisture away from buttons and controls. Front and back camera ports keep your iPod ready for action. How protective is Survivor Skin? An independent testing agency applied standards for impact resistance due to drops set by the U.S. Department of Defense (MIL-STD-810G) and tested Survivor Skin for Shock/Drop and Vibration. They gave its silicone and savvy engineering tougher tests than you will ever subject it to. It performed. Spectacularly. The Tests: Shock/Drop: An independent testing agency repeatedly dropped a Survivor Skin-clad iPod onto a concrete floor from a height of 6 ft. (That's higher than you will ever drop it from while standing.) Vibration: The test subjected Survivor Skin and iPod to 18 hrs of bone-shaking vibration, from 20 to 2000 cycles per second. (Imagine leaving your iPod on the floor of your car all day while you negotiate under-construction roads at top speed.)

..

6006839540003 This case is really cute looking but it scratched some of the paint off of my blue ipod. It looks good on the case though. If you are trying to take it off the ipod it takes at least five minutes. But this still is a good cases if you will be okay with dealing with some tiny scratches

6006839540003 Looks great and will protect your device on the back, I used a stick on face protector with it to cover the front.

6006839540003 It's a decent cover at a great price but the purple color isn't to appealing.

..

6006839540003 Good case that fits well. My daughter likes the owls and it was on sale.

..

6006839540003 I love this cover its small and compact. works great and has a great fit.

..

6006839540003 Cute and well made but I thought it made my mini too bulky. When I folded the front cover back, it didn't lay flat, making it difficult to hold in portrait mode. Also no Smart Cover feature. Overpriced for what it offers.

..

6006839540003 I love this case for the ipad mini. Its not bulky or too big. Fits nicely in my purse, and i feel like it still offers a good amount of protection for the ipad (although i havent dropped it yet so i cant say for sure). it has a stylus holder on the side which is pretty good. My only complaints are that on the sides. If you have a stylus in the holder it makes it hard to get to the volume buttons. Also, the sides of the screen get covered 1/16- 1/8in so sometimes if you need to do something at the very edge of the screen it can be a bit tricky. Overall though I would buy this case again in a heart beat. Very easy to hold and if you need it the front cover bends around the back and makes a stand.

..

6006839540003 Fits great on my mini people always comment on it camera and everything works fine with it on

6006839860005 This is my second drawing tablet and for the price it is awesome. The only real drawback I see on this is that it is laggy.

I have only had it for a week but will keep using it until I am very comfortable with it and will write another review at a later time

6006839860005 I recently bought one of these thinking that yea its a low cost mount cant be that bad. Shoulda listened to the rep at bestbuy.... said you get what you pay for. which is just that. the mount works. holds my 39" westinghouse led tv up on the wall. Unfortunately the 360 degree rotation that this mount offers is very loose. the tv will not stay level. no matter what we do. the tv will rotate to the left and wont sit straight. So sure the cheap mount was a good idea, holds the tv on the wall great; now if only i could tilt the rest of the room so when i look at the tv its not crooked... at least its holding up my 17 pound tv for 5 days now no issues. hasnt fallen off the wall :P. O well gonna go to the store and get a real mount now. Id say it was 20 bucks well spent to learn a lesson at least. got a good laugh. but i would stay away from this mount and listen to the reps in a bestbuy store.

6006839860005 
One of the great things about the new HDTVs is that they can be easily mounted to a wall, which frees the top of your furniture from a big heavy television and provides theater-like viewing angles, all in the comfort of your own home.When purchasing a wall mount there are several basic considerations. The first is the weight of your display versus the weight limit of the mount. You should look for a mount with a weight capacity that exceeds the weight of your TV by at least 50%. The reason for this is that the rated weight capacity of a mount is the absolute maximum weight it can withstand without incurring a structural failure of some kind. Also, the weight of the mount itself is included in the maximum capacity.The second thing to look for is a mount that can accommodate the mounting holes on the back of your TV. The actual size of the display itself (e.g., 42") is of almost no concern. The owner's manual of your TV should show the VESA size required, which is measured in millimeters.The third thing to look for is the type of mount. In general, there are three basic types: fixed, tilting, and fully articulating with tilt, swivel, and extension. Which you should choose depends entirely on your needs and your budget.This mount has the following features:Mount Type: Fixed Low ProfileWall Type: anyMinimum VESA: 200x200Maximum VESA: 800x500Weight Capacity: 200 lbsTypical Display Size: 37~63"Minimum Extension: 1.2"Maximum Extension: N/ATilt Range: N/ASwivel Range: N/AMaterial: SteelWall Plate Dimensions: 33.6" x 8.5"Front Plate Dimensions: N/AFeatures: fits VESA 100x100~800x500, includes security brackets, black color, hardware included*** 30-day easy returns. No restocking fee. Free lifetime technical support. Limited lifetime warranty. ***

6006839860005 I bought two of these and mounted both tv's without much trouble. I mounted a 42" and a 46" LCD. I wasn't expecting much but the mount seems very sturdy. They did exactly what I wanted for a great price! Its a basic mount and doesnt swivel up/down or side to side. I had to cover up cable/electrical outlets behind the tv so I had to use the provided spacers to make it stick out from the wall an extra inch or so. I liked the looks better without the spacers but there wasn't enough room to plug in the power cord. Both TV's had different size screws but there were plenty of screws in many sizes to fit many different tv's. Included were screws, spacers, washers, lag bolts, anchors, everything I needed to hang the tv's properly. I would recommend this mount if someone is looking for a no frills inexpensive mount for a larger television. I personally don't know if it would work for a 37" tv because I measured the mount and it was 37" wide and usually tv's are measured diagonally so it might stick out on the sides. No problems with the 42" tho.

DJs can put in some long hours as they spin the tunes and they need equipment that is both comfortable and rugged enough to withstand heavy use. These Monoprice Pro Headphones are designed for the professional sound spinner and the casual listener that wants the best quality sound and best durability available. The earpieces on these 'phones are equipped with thick, comfortable padding that keeps the music inside and the noise outside. They swivel up to 90 degrees so they can double as a makeshift set of speakers. The headphones can extend up to 1.5" on each side and are wide enough to fit over a cap, while maintaining good contact over the ears. The headpiece is also padded on the inside and is made of flexible rubber, ensuring that it won't break. The headsets do not have a fixed wire. Instead, there is a 3.5 mm jack in the bottom of the left earpiece, which allows a standard 3.5 mm audio patch cable to be inserted. This means that if you break a wire, you don't have to throw away the headphones or make a messy repair; just get a new cable and you're ready to rock again! The 50 mm drivers and 100 dB sensitivity ensure that these 'phones produce good volume and premium sound clarity at all frequencies. The kit comes with two 3.5 mm male-to-male, gold-plated audio cables and a 3.5 mm to 1/4" gold-plated adapter plug. The thicker cable is over 11.5 ft long and is well suited for professional work and for laying back on your couch to enjoy the tunes. A thinner, lightweight cable is also included, which measures about 50" in length and is better suited for more portable operations. High-quality sound, supreme durability, and maximum comfort. These ARE the 'phones you've been looking for!

6006839860005 I received the product in the mail today and sound comes out of only one ear cup. The customer service is also horrible. I am not able to speak with anyone regarding the defective product. I am upset and will never purchase from this seller again.

Pair a Bluetooth-enabled mobile phone or other device to this BRAVEN BZ570PBP portable wireless speaker to enjoy your music almost anywhere. The built-in microphone enables speakerphone functionality for hands-free calling.


..

34458735 This little Braven 570 is a great buy for the money, especially if you get it on sale like I did. I think it compares pretty favorably to most of the bigger names at 2-3X the price.
The sound is crisp and pretty clean. It's not going to blow you away with volume, but it's loud enough for most in reasonable proximity of it. The max volume is probably limited to the point of distortion, because while other BT speakers may be louder, they distort at those higher volumes. So what's the point? The mid-bass is decent, but low deep-bass is understandably weak to nonexistent. The Baven 570 is pretty small, about the size of US paper money and about 1.75" thick.
I especially love the inputs, outputs and controls. The on/off switch is a physical slide up/on down/off, so you always know if it is on or off, along with a sound it makes when you switch it on/off. It will also auto-shutoff if no BT signal is present after about 30 minutes. The +/- volume buttons give physical feedback (click) as you use them. They also function as Skip Track or Back Track if you hold them in. The BT pairing isn't a mystery, because it has it's own button with a phone handset symbol molded into it (I paired it without ever looking at the instructions). There is a standard 3.5mm input on the end with the switches and even one on the other end for output! Which is great if you want to supplement the sound with other speakers that don't have BT capability. I'm using the 3.5mm output jack to drive a powered speaker system with a subwoofer designed for computers to give the low deep-bass a punch and spread sound all over my workshop.
The 1200 mAh battery inside is charged via a standard female microUSB. There is a standard female full size USB for charging other devices with the build-in battery. A sweet option when your phone or MP3 player runs out of juice (up to 1A, no tablets) and another thing that "blows" away the big name BT speaker. And there is a separate button switch for checking the battery status via a small LED next to it, not some cryptic combination of button presses to perform.
The package includes one male 3.5mm to male 3.5mm cable, and one male USB to male microUSB cable. No separate charger is included. A standard cell phone microUSB charger works just fine.
The case design (looks like metal but is actually plastic) has dual speakers on one side with dual passive radiators on the reverse side. This little speaker functions as a speaker phone too, that's another thing one of the biggest names in speakers (that never go on sale) at 2-3X the price doesn't do.
I haven't tested the limits of the BT range, the expected battery life of 10 hours, or tried pairing it with other Braven BT speakers which are claimed by Braven, but I would expect it could.
I actually got three of these for less than the price of the big name BT speakers so I'm able to have one for the road, put one in my workshop, and keep one on my sun porch. BOOOM!

The Brother TD-4100N desktop barcode and label printers represent a great value at an affordable price. They feature a four-inch wide print head, high resolution printing, fast throughput, and a built-in auto cutter, all of which make these printers an excellent choice for many vertical market applications. Brother TD-4100N desktop barcode and label printers are optimized for Windows printing and combine fast, professional output with the ease of use and low maintenance requirements of direct thermal printing.


..

34458735 Nice and good pcs of printer.
Can not connect to network if you wish to use computer that are connected wireless - only wired connection are working.
Fast printing from any apps or programs.
But only one issue i have that USPS label for international shipping's are not readable at USPS office.

With 4-in-1 functionality, this Brother MFC-J4710DW all-in-one printer lets you print, copy, scan and fax to enhance the efficiency of your office. Built-in Ethernet and 802.11b/g/n wireless networking make it easy to connect to the Internet.


..

34458735 Should have known to stay away when this was on sale. This is without a doubt the worst printer I have ever owned and I have owned at least 6 for business and home use. First, if it is color quality you are looking for, run away! The colors, even when you choose "vivid" are flat and dull. Second if it is speed of 1st copy delivery you want, run away again! This thing has to "contort" for a few seconds until it decides whether or not it will oblige you by printing your document. Finally, don't EVEN try to use the "straight-through" function by using the back door for card-stock. This printer, when the card-stock is inserted just takes off and runs the blank stock through before you can even push print. And, if it is good color pictures you want, really run away for sure. You will be VERY disappointed when you see the results. As an additional note, you can use either wired or wireless, but not both as you can with a zillion other printers out there.......Wish I could have a "do-over", but it's not in the cards... The only thing left to do is to try to help you understand that you should avoid this printer unless you are into exercise and enjoy running-away....
Can only laugh and make fun of myself for this very bad decision.

34458735 When my old printer died I needed a fast printer, with color print, copier, scanner and paper capacity. It also needed to be small enough to put beside my computer and cost below $200.oo. I found it with The Brother 4-in-1.

..

34458735 Took quite a while to set up with wireless. Had to use Brother Solution Center and still had to try several different download options. The copies are crisp and fast but haven't printed photos as yet. Am hopeful they will be good also. I will try to review again when I have used this option. This all in one printer would be enough for a small home office use.

..

34458735 This a great value for a small footprint wifi double sided ADF scanner and auto duplex printing. The ability to print on ledger size paper is a bonus. You need to have a portable CD/DVD drive to install software on ultrabooks. It would be nice to download full software package from website.

..

34458735 So far this printer works fine and prints pretty good. Still getting familiar with it and have not yet tried different papers or envelopes. Double sided printing is fast and works great. As for the losing wifi connection, I think I've figured out the problem, it was me not the printer. Seems that the noise issue mentioned by some reviewers is not a big issue with me as I have had other brand printers that were noisier and it is no louder than my last printer. As for paper jams, so far I've not had any. Once you get familiar with the scanning features, scanning is a snap. Overall this is a great printer but I've only had it for about 2 weeks so time will tell and if anything comes up, I'll write another review.

..

34458735 To setup the printer initially, I tried to install the software that came on the provided CD-ROM. I have a MacBook Pro running OS-X 10.8.4 Mountain Lion and the software on the CD-ROM was outdated and wouldn't install out of the box. The setup instructions that came with the printer said to install the software before connecting the printer. I had to go to the Brother website to manually download the software and that too was confusing as it didn't exactly spell out what software was needed and what wasn't. After installing the software manually, I kept having print issues sporadically and the printer would disconnect whenever it felt like it.
To fix the issue, I had to uninstall all of the software and start from scratch. I connected the printer to my computer before installing anything and let Apple decide what software I needed and after it automatically downloaded all the software, I haven't had an issue since.
The CD-ROM should've had the latest software on it, or at the very least should've been capable of automatically finding the newest software online and updating itself for you instead of making the customer figure it out by yourself.
After all the software issues have been fixed, I love this printer! It does any and everything that you would need it to, and is very easy to use! I would definitely recommend this product to everyone. The only caveat is: connect the printer without installing anything and let your computer automatically figure out what software you need so maybe you won't go through the same headaches I have.

..

34458735 Better than HP 8660. We use it alot for scanning, and the HP automatic document feeder was light duty with one smaller driver wheel. The Brother is heavy duty with three good sized driver wheels.

..

34458735 I got a great deal and it was so much more solid than the one I returned from Epsom

..

34458735 I purchased the printer on May 29 2014, I called Canon for help setting the printer while I was talking to them the printers fax machine cut the call off, They sent me a new printer overnight. The new printer cut my calls off, but I could not get it to cut off the calls while I was talking to them, so they said it was nothing they could do. Today is June 27,2014 I decided to cut my losses and buy a different make printer.

..

34458735 This printer offers ability for document printing as well as card making and photo printing. It has the capacity for varying papers (types and sizes).

..

34458735 Very good printer
Used it every day
Prints real good photos

..

34458735 So far all is good with this printer. If you need a wireless and need a good deal as well as quality and quantity prints, this printer is great. Plus the ink refills are cheaper than Brother....

..

34458735 Best home printer I ever owned. I have owned at least six HPs in the last ten years. No no HPs for me.

..

34458735 This printer does everything it promises. Everyone will tell you it has a big footprint. They're right. Measure your desk before you buy.

..

34458735 I think I need the GEEK SQUAD because my computer person has been here 6 x trying to hook it up so that the fax can come in but not when I'm talking, my phone cuts off.

..

34458735 After going online to find out about TWO paper trays, during set=up, the printer works great. Had no trouble printing pix from iPhone and two different computers. Great printer for price.

..

34458735 Some features too complex. Canon representatives pleasant but only partially helpful.

ClearSounds CS-A55 Cordless Phone - Silver - Cordless - Caller ID - Backlight


..

34458735 This product is just marketing hype. Sound quality soon degraded, when it did recharge batteries they didn't last long, and it died completely at 18 months. A complete waste of money.

..

34458735 She can hear fairly good on the phone even with the amplication turned off. Ringer is very loud. All in all this is the phone I was looking for.

Want even more outrageous cooling flexibility? Step up to the 500R. It adds a 200mm fan mounted on the side panel's mesh screen for extra GPU cooling, a multi-channel fan controller, and removable and relocateable hard drive cages. Estimated availability: September 2011.


..

34458735 Great case with plenty of room and future proof upgrades. The cable management is awesome and the stock fans keep everything cool. I have a z77 chipset atx in it with a gtx 760 a 850 w power supply with 16 gb of ram and it still looks empty. Overall very sturdy case that will not dissapoint.

..

34458735 I am an architect student who decided to build my own comp instead of following the trend of purchasing expensive Apple Macs... I find the design of the Corsair very modern and the functionality of the case is all there. The 200mm side fan is quite and ventilates the comp well. The side compartment hides all the wires and the top of the case leaves space for 2x120mm fans or even a Corsair H100i water cooler. I really do like this case and the price is well worth it!

..

34458735 I received a used computer case. Inside of the case was dusty and cat hairs on the dust filters. I purchased multiple cases before and always preffered Corsair because of the design. I had to use the case since I had to build it for a client and made sure the case was cleaned prior to transaction. I would recommend to check online purchased items at the store first before leaving.

..

34458735 This case was exactly what I wanted for my latest creation. the color is absolutely perfect and with the other options available from Corsair my latest machine is amazing.

..

34458735 The Corsair 500R is one of the best cases Ive used.
Highlights:
Scalability
Clean lines
Perfect cable management
Plenty of room to maneuver around with lots of options
This case is currently housing the following components and was by far the easiest case Ive ever worked with
ASUS P8Z77-V PRO
i7 2600K 3.4Ghz Quad Core CPU
MSI Twin Frozer II GTX 560 TI 2gig DDR5 (OC)
8gig Corsair Vengeance RAM 1600Mhz
Corsair 500R Gaming Case Arctic White edition
Corsair 650 Enthusiast Edition (semi Modular) Power Supply
Extremely pleased with the entire build and would recommend this case to anyone looking for a great case with plenty of style.

..

34458735 Large case with plenty of room to expand. Both sides of case easily removed to access motherboard and wires. Total of 4 fans included, 2 in front, one in back and large on side. Dust filter on bottom for power unit. Could have used dust filter on largest fan on side.
Comes with USB adapter if your motherboard does not support the USB 3.0 so front USB ports are usable...BIG PLUS
Combined with Corsair Power unit,. holes lined up and installed in less than a minute
Black paint coated inside. no sharp edges to cut self while installing motherboard.
Top removeable dust cover perfect place to mount a water cooler if so inclined or add more fans.

..

34458735 Had to buy a wall mount plate. My other wall phone just had to use 2 wall anchor screws. Ring is nauseating bell. No way to change it. It does work though so I guess that's a good thing. Took almost a week to be delivered to the store and there was inadequate notification of its arrival at store.

..

34458735 A very good phone. It will work even whenever power goes out.

Creative takes your music to a new level of excellence with the GigaWorks T40 series II speaker system. Designed and tuned to bring acoustic fidelity to your desktop, this two-piece system with its gloss black finish combines the best components and real power with the famous GigaWorks tradition to deliver pure music at its finest. This high-quality component is arranged in MTM (midrange-tweeter-midrange) configuration to achieve audiophile standards, supported by Creative's BasXPort technology for responsive bass. With front-mounted controls and two inputs for simultaneous connection to different sources, this is the system for those who demand the best.


..

34458735 this speakers have a nice bass, without the overwelming thump bass you can get with a dedicated bass box. Also, you save space ( this set do not have a bas box)
Still you can enjoy nice bass and crisp mids, an excelent tweeter and a vere good looking speaker. I have them connected to a 2014 iMac and they work great.

..

34458735 My old Creative 650s finally bit the dust and I bought these to replace them. The 650s were a 6.1 system with a large subwoofer and were great for gaming, though they were not so great for listening to music. Nowadays I only occasionally game on my PC, but I do sample a lot of music tracks before buying and downloading them. The T40s do a much better job at music playback. When playing games though, it sounds like the game is being played inside an echo chamber. Sometimes these speakers can sound very boxy as well, especially when the volume is turned up. In spite of my complaints I am keeping them, as they are adequate to my current needs. For the money I doubt there is much out there that is going to sound a lot better and my current usage doesn't justify spending two or three times as much to get a set of speakers that would sound significantly better.

..

34458735 These speakers go in standby mode if no sound is detected in a few minutes, and they take about 3 to 4 seconds to come out of standby. This makes you miss any audio in that 3 to 4 seconds and any alerts if you have them connected to a computer. And no way to disable that feature. And the Power supply for the speakers remains on, so there is no power savings. What's the point of the standby mode? Sound quality is not good enough to overlook the annoyance of the standby feature.

..

34458735 freakin' great sound, okay? good higher range. good bass. okay?

..

34458735 Sounds not bad. Like the auto power on feature.
..........

..

34458735 I wanted to improve the sound I was getting from my desktops. I am a musician so I am pretty picky about what my ears are hearing. These were on sale and had good reviews so I gave them a shot. My PC is hooked up to my stereo, so these are not meant to replace my stereo speakers, but to give some decent sound while at my desk. They do just that. They have a nice well rounded balanced frequency response. The bass is decent. However, you need a sub-woofer if you want booming bass, but that is not what these are built for. The two extra features I like are the external input for an mp3 player and the auto power down.
As said these are not meant to fill a room to replace a stereo. However they are really good desktops that I would recommend.

..

34458735 I needed a new sound system for my computer and I also wanted to add sound to my TV while watching movies. These speakers make it so easy to do this.

..

34458735 I bought these speakers to enhance the volume on my laptop which I use for downloaded guitar lessons. There is enough volume to play along with the "instructor" and the associated backing tracks sound out bright and clear. Actually......enought to crank up the amp a bit. Good buy from BEST BUY!

..

34458735 Great sound, great appearance, easy set up, all for a great price!

..

34458735 I gave up a massive 20 year old $1500 component stereo system with large walnut speakers, receiver, turntable, five CD changer, and dual tape drive. For easy listening in a living room while reading, these speakers are great. I can hear all of the instruments in a symphonic orchestra. I ripped 200 CDs to a small tablet and can also listen to worldwide stations with my TuneInRadio app.
I tried a 2.1 system and hated the booming of the subwoofer. This system has adequate sound in high, mid, and deep range. I will stick to 2.0 speakers. I like the replaceable (not hardwired into the speaker) audio cable just in cased it breaks like my Dell computer speaker did.

DGB-900BC Brewer is a fully programmable coffeemaker with a burr grinder for superior coffee. Its special burr grinder grinds the coffee without influencing the integrity of the bean, so the true flavor is maintained. The strength selector and the grind control functions fine-tune intensity and volume, and the thermal carafe seals in heat and freshness so the last cup is as good as the first.


..

34458735 This is the 2nd maker we have purchased. The first one lasted several years, but guess just wore out. Had trouble getting the the water to all go through. But, we haven't found another maker that grinds fresh beans first thing in the a.m. and is ready when our alarm goes off!
You do need to clean the bean shoot every time you fill up the bean holder as it does tend to cake a bit, but not that bad really!
I guess if it was such an issue we wouldn't have bought a 2nd unit! Set the timer and wake up to freshly brewed coffee....enjoy!

..

34458735 Fresh coffee fresh water the rest the coffee maker does by itself. Makes great coffee. Please use a good coffee. You will be well rewarded.

..

34458735 Expensive, but well worth it! I set to have coffee ready at 4am, and at 9PM (yes, PM), it is still hot enough to drink! I have not found any negatives in this product, and I will definately buy Cuisinart appliances from now on!

..

34458735 We tried this coffee maker for 2 weeks and it never once made steaming hot coffee. Hot for a few minutes but within a few minutes was warm. My wife likes adding cream and sugar and after that, the coffee was just warm at best.
The machine is beautiful and looked great on our counter.
Another somewhat of a con is that there are quite a few steps to complete between each brewing - 3 or 4 pieces to clean, brush out bean chute, etc. The dvd that comes with it is 20 minutes long to explain what needs to be done.
The burr grinder is a plus but luke warm coffee and lots of steps. I had high hopes for this machine but didn't quite deliver.
The last issue that I had was that I contacted Cuisinart customer support to see if they could help remedy the temperature issue I had but never heard back from them.

..

34458735 Press the button, walk away, return and pour a fresh cup of coffee. This unit grinds the coffee quickly and then brews it quickly. Very nice. You must clean the ground coffee shoot after 4 or 5 pots or it will clog. But, that is not hard to do.

..

34458735 I just love this coffeemaker...it is the best ever.

..

34458735 I really like the coffee maker. Having the grinder and maker in one device is a huge convenience. I like that I can make 2 cups or 12, and the coffee is great. I don't find the cleaning procedures to be a hassle as I clean all cooking appliances, tools and such after each use except for my oven.
On the downside, the stailnless steel carafe is frustrating to pour coffee out of. Apparently it is designed to keep the coffee hot, which it does, but I've resinged myself to taking the lid off to pour the coffee and them putting it back on to keep the coffee at temperature.
I do recommend this for those looking for a good top end appliance.

..

34458735 For less than the cost of a decent burr grinder and a decent thermal coffee maker, this combo does both well. Easy to clean, non-drip carafe, good grinder, good coffee.

..

34458735 I absolutely love this coffee maker. It makes the best coffee I have ever had. It is also beautiful on the counter top. The other reviewer here must have gotten a bad machine, every company has it's lemons. I know a few people who have this machine due to me recommending it and have had no problems. Mine is a couple of years old. I bought it when Cuisinart first came out with this model. I had the original grind N Brew maker but bought this one when it came out because you don't have to clean out the grinder and fill it with beans with every pot. The older one made great coffee too but too much cleaning. When the coffee maker I have now finally dies I am going to buy another one just like it.

..

34458735 Very excited to use this machine. Husband ran recommended pots of water thru for initial use. Used it yesterday morning and again last night. Programmed it to brew this morning. Daughter tells me smoke is coming from it. I tell her it must be steam. Come down to kitchen to a very bad smell of burnt plastic and something on the surface of my granite counter tops. Dumped coffee, cleaned everything up, dried everything (components) and decided to try again. Poured water into the resavoire and watched the water all pour OUT of the bottom of the machine and all over the counter top!! Am now going to return it (did not buy it here).

Speed up your cooking process with this easy-to-use food processor that features a 14-cup work bowl, a mixing/chopping blade and a dough blade for cutting through various foods with ease. The extra large feed tube holds whole fruits and vegetables.


..

34458735 I've only had this food processor for a few weeks, but it's pretty amazing.
Chopping: It's like lightning! Chops and purees even a small amount of food in its large bowl.
Slicing: Slices veggies and fruits very thin, very fast. If you're looking for picture-perfect slices you have to go one piece at a time, but if you just want some slices for say, pizza, this baby'll slice it up in no time.
Grating: Used it to grate some hard cheese for pizza -- no fuss, no muss.
Dough: The dough blade is great! I always dreaded trying to mix pizza dough and other doughs by hand but the dough blade makes smooth, well-blended doughs in no time.
Yes, it's a pricey machine but so far, I think it's worth it. It seems to be very sturdy and well-made and I plan on having this food processor for a long time.

Browse Web pages on the go using this Ematic EGD170BU tablet's built-in Wi-Fi, which facilitates wireless Web connection, so you can access your e-mail, stream online media and more. The 7" capacitive multitouch screen enables accurate navigation.


..

34458735 I selected this tablet based on price and features. Reviews from other sites helped in this decision and the negative reviews didn't dissuade me as they seemed petty.
I should have paid attention.
1. Shuts down suddenly in the middle of app or book and is difficult to restart without resetting the tablet. Power down and up doesn't help.
2. Touch screen is overly sensitive or not reacting at all
3. The more apps loaded, the slower it gets
4. Charges rapidly, the discharges just as rapidly.
There are other things but you get the gist of it from the above.

34458735 can't believe the low price of this tablet which out performs my Samsung Galaxy for less money. just wow.....

..

34458735 I am very happy with the purchase overall. The tablet has a very good screen resolution and it is great for watching movies, listnening to music and reading books. It is a great value for the price.

..

34458735 I bought this for my boyfriend to take on business trips to stay connected without having to take his laptop. It works great for its intended purpose. It's lightweight and included the google play store which is great for the price. I would def recommend!

..

34458735 So far all is going well. It would have been helpful if when I checked out, if a cover or case would have been suggested.

..

34458735 Item is great, low cost tablet. No reason to jump and get an iPad for 2x - 3x the cost. Get one like this first!

..

34458735 So after reading a bunch of "you get what you pay for" reviews on the various cheaper tablets available this Thanksgiving, I decided to pay 2-3 times as much and get a more powerful one. With an advertised quad core 1.5 GHz processor, 8 GB of memory instead of the typical 4, a higher resolution touch screen, etc. how could I go wrong? Unfortunately this unit doesn't live up to its specs. The tablet is slow, easily bogging down completely. It takes several seconds just to show the display when you hit the power button after it goes blank. The touch screen is very unresponsive, with certain points in applications completely inaccessible due to bad calibration and interactions with the system menus. For example, the control and search menus on the Amazon app store are generally unusable. Attempting to hit them brings the system menu from the top of the screen. Basic Android features like clearing the notification list are missing from this implementation. Certain apps and games will have controls that don't respond, some even hanging, presumably because controls won't respond to the touch screen.
The worst part, however, is the memory implementation. With 8 GB onboard, I expected to be able to use the remaining memory after the OS plus the supported 32 GB of external storage to put all my apps, etc. on the device. After downloading just a handful of apps I started getting out of memory warnings and system failures, including reboots. I discovered that there was only 1 GB of free internal memory after the OS and factory installed apps. I then noticed that there was a second block of internal storage listed with 4 GB of free space, but I was still running out of memory. I put in a new 32 GB SD card and started transferring my apps to the SD card to free up the 1 GB of space that was running out, and after I downloaded a few more apps and repeated the process, I started getting warnings that my SD card was running out of memory! It turns out that they've configured the additional 4 GB of memory on this device as an "internal" SD card that's hiding the external card from the Android's "Move to SD card" feature. Thus, you're limited to a maximum of about 5 GB of apps using all the internal memory only. And given that there is always a certain amount of data and application that never gets moved to the SD card, you're limited by that as well. If they'd truly provided a single 8 GB of internal storage you'd be able to have 32 GB of apps plus approximately 5 GB of storage for the pieces that don't move, as well as those apps that won't run from an SD card at all. Extremely disappointing!
I've attempted to contact the Ematic tech support on this, and after waiting a week they finally responded with directions on how to move applications to the "convenient internal SD card", totally ignoring my original request. At this point, it looks like it's going back!
So it looks like sometimes you get less than you pay for.

..

34458735 Great Tablet for the price. Fast and easy to use. However, this low price means it lacks some features that some tablet users would expect a standard tablet to have. First, it lacks a back facing camera and the quality of the camera is quite low. Second, it has a single speaker on the back, meaning that headphones are basically essential. Lastly, the placement of the buttons and camera makes have awkward handling at times.
Though it's weak in these aspects, it is still strong in the others. This tablet gives you a plethora of options that you can access from the home menu, a micro sd slot, HD resolution, and many more. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who needs a budget tablet.

34458735 Item is great, low cost tablet. No reason to jump and get an iPad for 2x - 3x the cost. Get one like this first!

..

34458735 So after reading a bunch of "you get what you pay for" reviews on the various cheaper tablets available this Thanksgiving, I decided to pay 2-3 times as much and get a more powerful one. With an advertised quad core 1.5 GHz processor, 8 GB of memory instead of the typical 4, a higher resolution touch screen, etc. how could I go wrong? Unfortunately this unit doesn't live up to its specs. The tablet is slow, easily bogging down completely. It takes several seconds just to show the display when you hit the power button after it goes blank. The touch screen is very unresponsive, with certain points in applications completely inaccessible due to bad calibration and interactions with the system menus. For example, the control and search menus on the Amazon app store are generally unusable. Attempting to hit them brings the system menu from the top of the screen. Basic Android features like clearing the notification list are missing from this implementation. Certain apps and games will have controls that don't respond, some even hanging, presumably because controls won't respond to the touch screen.
The worst part, however, is the memory implementation. With 8 GB onboard, I expected to be able to use the remaining memory after the OS plus the supported 32 GB of external storage to put all my apps, etc. on the device. After downloading just a handful of apps I started getting out of memory warnings and system failures, including reboots. I discovered that there was only 1 GB of free internal memory after the OS and factory installed apps. I then noticed that there was a second block of internal storage listed with 4 GB of free space, but I was still running out of memory. I put in a new 32 GB SD card and started transferring my apps to the SD card to free up the 1 GB of space that was running out, and after I downloaded a few more apps and repeated the process, I started getting warnings that my SD card was running out of memory! It turns out that they've configured the additional 4 GB of memory on this device as an "internal" SD card that's hiding the external card from the Android's "Move to SD card" feature. Thus, you're limited to a maximum of about 5 GB of apps using all the internal memory only. And given that there is always a certain amount of data and application that never gets moved to the SD card, you're limited by that as well. If they'd truly provided a single 8 GB of internal storage you'd be able to have 32 GB of apps plus approximately 5 GB of storage for the pieces that don't move, as well as those apps that won't run from an SD card at all. Extremely disappointing!
I've attempted to contact the Ematic tech support on this, and after waiting a week they finally responded with directions on how to move applications to the "convenient internal SD card", totally ignoring my original request. At this point, it looks like it's going back!
So it looks like sometimes you get less than you pay for.

34458735 Great Tablet for the price. Fast and easy to use. However, this low price means it lacks some features that some tablet users would expect a standard tablet to have. First, it lacks a back facing camera and the quality of the camera is quite low. Second, it has a single speaker on the back, meaning that headphones are basically essential. Lastly, the placement of the buttons and camera makes have awkward handling at times.
Though it's weak in these aspects, it is still strong in the others. This tablet gives you a plethora of options that you can access from the home menu, a micro sd slot, HD resolution, and many more. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who needs a budget tablet.

34458735 Very nice tablet for the price. I really like the ease of use and setup was quick. Synced all my android apps from my phone flawlessly. Web use is excellent.

..

34458735 I am very happy with the purchase overall. The tablet has a very good screen resolution and it is great for watching movies, listnening to music and reading books. It is a great value for the price.

..

34458735 I bought this for my boyfriend to take on business trips to stay connected without having to take his laptop. It works great for its intended purpose. It's lightweight and included the google play store which is great for the price. I would def recommend!

Enjoy media and games with this Ematic Genesis Prime EGS004BU tablet, which features a 7" capacitive multitouch display for a responsive touch interface and crisp visuals. The Android 4.1 Jelly Bean operating system ensures ease of use.


..

34458735 Dropped 2 feet onto wood floor. Device did not work after that.
It is too fragile for use in the home.

..

34458735 bought as a gift for my sister, this is her first tablet, so her requirements and familiarity are minimal, this is fine for a casual user.

..

34458735 Not the greatest of tablet. I can't say that of all of them. I must of gotten a dud.

..

34458735 Gave this to my son for his Birthday and it broke within 30 days. smh

..

34458735 Worse item I have ever purchase from best buy ....this should be sold at dollar general.....junk !

..

34458735 I bought this for my nephew and he complains about not being able to load games.

..

34458735 If you want a basic tablet for say young children or older adults starting to learn then this is a good tablet for the price. It is easy to use, a good size screen,etc. I added Aldiko and it also became a very good e-reader. The internet connection is good but keep in mind the further you get from your router/modem/hotspot the slower its gonna get. The battery power seems to be pretty good...started with a full charge and went a few hours before having to recharge.
For the more experienced user this tablet maybe a bit too basic for you. It comes with Google play and I added amazon app store. I tried to download several apps such as WWE, Ibotta, Iheartradio and was told this device is incompatible.
Another downside is the charger. The USB cord is interchangeable between computer & ac/dc charging options but the cord is on the short side if you want to use it while its plugged into a wall socket.
If you open the box there is a paper stating that if you do a review for the product and send them the requested info you can get a car charger and headphones for free.
It also only comes with the tablet, a usb cord & a plug in wall charger. So expect to be dishing out extra for everything else.

..

34458735 bought this for my son for Christmas. had it for less than a week and it would no longer take a charge. best buy wouldn't take it back. disappointed kid and customer.

..

34458735 Good tablet for the price. Wish it came with a more detailed users guide to show me how to operate it.

..

34458735 I bought this tablet for my son. I shopped around for a few days comparing prices, functionality, & of course price. I read the reviews on a few & when i read the ones for this tablet i was convinced. It arrived the very next day. (Kudos to Best buy!). It worked perfectly right out of the box. Play store pre-installed for apps. It's just like having an android phone so if you are familiar with them you will have no problems. I set him up a g-mail account & was able to download apps while searching the internet & doing other things during initial set up. My son has been using it since & no problems. He downloads free games & apps & loves it. He is even able to do school projects & transfer to mini-usb card so i can print it for him. Really glad i bought it & would definitely recommend. Hope this helps & GBY :)

..

34458735 My 15 year old son wanted a small tablet (in addition to his laptop, desktop, mp3 player etc. - a real technophile!). He likes the small size of this tablet. I dropped his Lenovo 7" and it broke the screen immediately so I decided to try this brand. He had a little trouble connecting to our wireless router, but once he solved that, he says it works great.

34458735 I was super excited till I nurned it on. Went to put in a micro sd and it couldnt read anything. Then all the programs become corrupt this was with in 12 hours of recieving it. Now even when I factory reset the device it wont clear any of my info. I kept it in the case and let it be next day it was covered in scratches. I even contacted the company and they never got back to me on how to fix it. Dont buy unless you want to suffer

..

34458735 Unless you're buying this for a small child, dont buy it. Its so slow I was frustrated within 5 minutes of taking it out of the box. Unable to run apps like skype and netflix. Comes preloaded with junk so you inly get about 1 gb of storage. I wasnt even able to perform a factory reset on mine. Better off spending more money on something that will work.

American Red Cross TurboDyne AXIS Weather & Alert Radio - with Weather Disaster - FM, AM - 7 Weather


..

34458735 It works really well Like that it is small easy to use and easy to store

..

34458735 I got it basically for emergency use, but it works for everyday use around the house also. can use on ac or crank power.

..

34458735 I use this radio around the house when doing chores. I don't know how long the battery lasts when you crank it, but the triple A batteries last a while and it has a nice flashlight although not as bright as it could be. Overall a very nice radio and would be great in an emergency. I haven't used the battery charger for my phone but it comes with a usb cord to charge phones as well.

..

34458735 My Daughter loves it! I borrow it all the time. Great personal radio. I love the USB Charger.

..

34458735 Love that I can charge my phone with this when the electric is out. Also love the crank so no batteries are necessary. My son love the fact that it has a flashlight so he can see when the lights go out. And of course it is great knowing that we always have a radio to listen to the weather when the storms have knocked out the electric.

..

34458735 If you purchase this emergency radio be sure to purchase more AAA size batteries than you think you will need -- trust me, you will need them! Since there is no AC adapter feature (other than to charge it using your car battery) you cannot charge the radio in your home in anticipation of an emergency. I found myself in the position of having to use it as my primary radio for a couple of weeks as my old radio broke, and eventually I came to the realization that using it for more than 3-4 hours a day was costing me more than I anticipated. The reception was adequate for FM and the weather station, but I wasn't too pleased with AM reception -- I had to move it around the house to get clear reception. The audio quality is excellent and it is easy to use. The instruction manual is very clear.

..

34458735 I will have to use it a bit longer to see if it suits my needs.

..

34458735 I just love my radio....I take it in the car with me. It's so dependable and built strong. Nice antenna and I get a good variety of stations on both AM and FM.

..

34458735 Great product. Works as advertised. No problems. xxxxxxxxxx

..

34458735 I purchased this item as emergency gear. The 7 weather stations are preset and in a suburb of Minneapolis I can receive only one of them and the reception is good. The case is mostly plastic with a metal crank and flashlight. An all metal case would hold up better but since this is an emergency radio I won't be using it much.
Pros:
Flashlight is bright
USB port for recharging cell phone works great
Battery status indicator and battery holds charge well
AM/FM great reception
Cons:
Red emergency light is not very bright or useful
Does not come with an AC adapter

Your evenings in the kitchen will be easier when this microwave's one-touch sensor cooking automates the heating process, ensuring your meals are cooked to your liking. The Cook-A-Round automatic turntable keeps your food in motion for even heating.


..

34458735 I'm on my 2nd one of these. The first i thought was just a bad unit. 4 months then the inside light would never go out. this latest one went out after 2 1/2 months. It runs continuously. thats right. once the cook cycle is done it keeps on runnin' you can unplug it and plug it back in and it picks up where it left off. you can keep hitting the stop button but it wont stop. These microwaves look like theyre top notch and their priced higher than better quality microwaves. ( i replaced my 6 yr old Sharp microwave with this one...yeah the $80 sharp is still running at my place of business) Dont call Panasonic for help without a receipt because they wont help you. Theyll ask you to pay for repairs to their faulty product. learned my lesson. the old fool me once , fool me twice deal. Makes me a fool but they wont get me again..ever. glad it didnt burn my house down or something.

..

34458735 I bought this to replace a smaller capacity microwave. I wasn't aware of some of the special features it offered and they are fantastic. I just wish I would have waited a week and then it was on sale.

..

34458735 This Panasonic is worth for the money. Its' convenient for daily use. I like the quiet of microwave. I be back home by 1 ro 2 am. I can warm up food & drink and thanks to its quietness. It doesn't bother sleeping just a few feet away from the microwave.

..

34458735 I like this machine and will probably like it more as i continue to use it. The only thing I have a problem with is the power level settings. One my old machine if you wanted to use power level 6 all you did it punch "Power level", then punch "6"... on this machine you have to "Power level" 4 times until it reaches the number 6. This annoys me to no end.. but i will get used to it.

..

34458735 Overall this microwave has been great. Easy to use, easy to program and a nice upgrade to the 13 year old Panasonic I had that finally died. Just wish there was a handle on the door to open the microwave rather than a separate button. All in all it was a great buy at affordable price from bestbuy.com with 6 month financing

..

34458735 This replaces our panasonic that died after 15 years. I am very pleased with the updates. I had to order it online, because the store didn't carry it. I got it within 3 days. It is well worth the wait.

..

34458735 I read many reviews on this and competing manufacturers/models. From what I read, this model's rating suffered mainly from factory defects. My unit arrived free of any apparent defects and has been operating well for about 2 weeks.
Having used a Kenmore model for nearly 20 years, I wanted something of similar reliability. This unit is much lighter than my old Kenmore, with plastic having replaced metal on exterior surfaces. Also, the brochure claims that inverter technology components are lighter and more energy efficient than the older-style magnetrons. We'll have to see how long it lasts, but I can say that for right now, it does an EXCELLENT JOB of reheating/defrosting food quickly and evenly.
Yeah, it could have a few more bells and whistles, but I'm happy without a button for every imaginable use. I rate its performance to date as 5 stars, and will upgrade its overall rating to 5 stars if that continues That is if I can remember to...

..

34458735 love it and would recommend it to all! Heats quickly and will accommodate a large casserole dish. 2nd one we have owned...we use it till it dies and purchase another.

..

34458735 We have had this microwave for a couple of months and are pleased so far. We used to have a very small and simple microwave and have had no problem using the easy shortcut features such as the defroster, sensor cooking and popcorn. Our old microwave was an Emerson and lasted us for about 6 years. We are hoping this Panasonic lasts at least that much or more.

..

34458735 I purchased this Panasonic Microwave the end of MAY 2011 (this year) (It is now ONLY Aug Of 2011) It Looked Great out of the box, as It should be when purchasing a microwave from a higher end Manufacturer or so I thought..... Let me just start by saying The issues I had was through NO fault of AMAZON, they delivered it just fine. The issue is with the PANASONIC CORPORATION AND THE LACK OF CUSTOMER SERVICE PROVIDED.
The Microwave started to display an error code 2 days ago. I called Panasonic Directly. I was Told in no uncertain terms that Panasonic WILL NOT REPLACE the unit even though it is less than 90 days old, regardless of defect! I tried to explain to the "Customer Service" specialist that this unit has a 1 year warranty, to which I was Informed by said specialist: that, It is "MY responsibility" to pay to ship the unit to one of Panasonics "Certified Panasonic service / Repair Companies" (that is 2 hours away.) And.... after the unit is received, The repair company will decide if it is infact "in need of repair or If it was damaged by me" ?!@ Really??
Then she had the nerve to tell me that the error code displayed on My broken microwave is interpreted as an " electrical current issue on my end". And , that she Recommends that I Pay to have an electrician come to my home and instal a designated circut for just this microwave alone. Excuse me??? I explained again, that this was not my FIRST Microwave, and that I have NEVER heard of a "Non Specialty" microwave needing to have its own circut breaker and that My home was built less than 5 years ago, and that it was Ludicris to insinuate the failure was on my end!!
I am more than upset, I did a lot of searching to find a worthy Microwave unit. In today's economy, It is shameful for Big Business to take the money I paid for this Microwave unit, I expected more from a well known company but found out that both my MONEY and the "Panasonic company name" were both worthless!!!. I will NEVER purchase another product from a company that puts out defective merchandise and in turn, tries to blame the Customer for it!! Terrible!! Shame on you Panasonic!!

34458735 It's a nice case for the price. Does what its supposed to which is a plus!

..

34458735 This is a grest phone case to showcase your love for retro gaming. It fits perfectly on my iPhone 5. Most "cosmestic" cases are difficult to assmble; this case snapped on with ease.
Since this is a "cosmetic" or "look at me" case it isn't made for heavy use and doesn't provide elit protection from your phone.

..

34458735 Very good price, a good protector, i will recommend to nuy this

..

34458735 After purchasing the green and black version of this case I went back to purchase another and also bought this case to give as a gift. The colors gave the case more of a vintage theme than I would prefer but for less than $3 each I would recommend getting all colors available.

..

34458735 I love this case!!! The price and quality of the product is great! I would definitely recommend this case to anyone that has an iPhone 5.

Dress up your iPad 2 with style and functionality.Carry your iPad like a personal notebook with Elan Folio. The case flips open for quick access to your Multi-Touch display, and closes like a book for privacy and protection.Elan Folio doesn't stop working when you put it down. Flip the cover around and tuck it in back to turn the folio into an adjustable easel. Elan Folio holds your iPad upright in landscape position for viewing documents, pictures, and video. For drawing, tapping, and typing, turn it over and lay it down in a comfortable inclined position.Elan Folio protects your Multi-Touch display with a microsuede lining, and strategically-placed cutouts provide unhindered access to ports, cameras, and controls. Elan Folio is easy to use, easy to carry, and easy to keep clean.


..

34458735 This is an ok cover for the iPad 2 and beyond. My only problem is with the front cover, because it has no support; it's constantly opening by itself. The cover needs support, and you can't adjust to use as a stand

..

34458735 I chose this case for my new iPad as it mimics the shape and functionality of the original iPad black rubber case I have on our old one. Well, it's a bit subpar for the price. The white poly material looks like leather, which I love, and it's also easy to clean. However, the front flap is flimsy. It feels like an afterthought. It's weak and when placed in the back holder to sit the iPad as an easel, it just doesn't hold it up sturdy or stay in the back clasp well.
Pretty to look at but not as functional as I expected.

..

34458735 I like the overall design of this cover. It does a good job of protecting the iPad without looking like a teenager fashion accessory. The inside fabric has a nice feel, and the skin itself is soft. It looks like a notepad you would carry ten years ago with a pad of paper in it.
But the cover is too stiff to be used with the iPad auto off feature of the screen. Just walking will make the screen turn on and off a bunch. I finally turned that feature off on the iPad and only turn it on manually.
I am not so crazy about the "stand" feature on the back. My wife's cover has three little bumps that let you adjust the angle pretty easy. This is one little pocket to put the cover flap in. It makes the iPad almost straight up and down, not very useful. So I end up watching using a pillow propped under the iPad instead, not that big of a deal.

..

34458735 The case is great except that the case don't really fit the iPad 2. To plug in to the bottom you have to always adjust the case so it fits.

34458735 This is an ok cover for the iPad 2 and beyond. My only problem is with the front cover, because it has no support; it's constantly opening by itself. The cover needs support, and you can't adjust to use as a stand

..

34458735 I chose this case for my new iPad as it mimics the shape and functionality of the original iPad black rubber case I have on our old one. Well, it's a bit subpar for the price. The white poly material looks like leather, which I love, and it's also easy to clean. However, the front flap is flimsy. It feels like an afterthought. It's weak and when placed in the back holder to sit the iPad as an easel, it just doesn't hold it up sturdy or stay in the back clasp well.
Pretty to look at but not as functional as I expected.

Play your favorite songs while traveling with this FM transmitter that allows you to listen to music selections from your iPod or iPhone through your car stereo.


..

34458735 The unit connected right up to my iPhone 3G but then came up with an error on the phone that it was not a supported device. After downloading the App it was recognized and supported. However, the transmitter was so weak that the phone had to be held within an inch of the radio to be heard at all otherwise all the radio had was static on any selected channel. Don't waste your money

..

34458735 I purchased the iPhone 3gs and was told this would be perfect for me to play my iPod feature in my car. No matter what station it set to I would have to turn my radio full blast just to barely hear music. Definitely returning!

..

34458735 I'm a commuter college student and I wanted to listen to my iPod Classic in my car while driving to and from school (which can be a good 30 minute drive from my house, depending on traffic). I looked into FM Transmitters for the easy set-up and I personally wanted a cordless one where I can put in my backpack when I got to school so it wouldn't get stolen out of my car. This device was perfect for what I needed/wanted. I've never had a problem with it and I frequently use it. It's great for road trips (I drive to Kenosha, WI and Champaign-Urbana occasionally) and the sound quality is amazing. I accidentally lost mine last night due to the fact it was dark and I was tired, so I plan on going to buy another one tomorrow.

..

34458735 I'm not sure why all the reviewers below are complaining so much. I think this product works really well. Yes, occasionally, it will get static-y and I usually can only keep my iPod/iPhone sitting in my cupholder or else the static will begin. However, I read a review which advised to keep the transmitter on the lowest FM reading possible, so I keep it either at 88.1 or 88.3 and it works perfectly! I just recently made a 6.5-hour trip through major cities and never encountered any problems/static except for once and it only lasted for maybe 15 seconds. I think it's a great investment!

..

34458735 I thought it was trash at first because it cut out and stations had lots of static. I did some online research and found out that in US it is unallowable to broadcast on station below 88 so you can change the country code which will allow you to set station at 87.9 which is very clear, also in order to make it not cut out while using Pandora you have to first play an iTune song and pause it then open pandora app and choose station. With all that done it is a great value for the price and works fine.

..

34458735 I returned very quickly because it failed to work at all. When i did get a signal it was very staticy. I'm one that is always unsure of these reviews but trust me the people that rated bad are 100% right on this one.

..

34458735 The only radio it works good on is the WAVE radio you can actually walk across the room with this device , but as far as our car is not recommended to my enemy.

..

34458735 For a passive powered, no cables, FM-Transmitter this is a good product. It's not perfect, but good. I was skeptical from the reviews here, took the dive anyway and was pleasantly surprised. Don't expect full-volume hi-fidelity. Its FM stereo and the volume is normalized. From my iPhone4, adjusting the volume has no effect. Auto-scan is good -seems to find the same 3 channels, but you can manually override. This is a tiny (almost flimsy) plug-in (ipod port) device that uses the local ipod/iphone power. There is a micro USB port available (for power?).
Three sound modes (SmartSound, Stereo, Mono). Radio txt display is hit or miss, often juggling letters across my radio display -sometimes it works.
All FM-Transmitters operate at the same wattage - again don't expect stellar sound. Direct connect of factory Bluetooth is the best, this is two notches below. This device is compact and does the job nicely if your looking for an ipod/iphone car audio option.

..

34458735 It cuts out frequently. Horrible. Don't buy. Worst FM transmitter EVER made!

..

34458735 I really like this because I can use it anywhere not just in my car. I also really like that it auto tunes to avaialable stations so you don't ahve to do a lot of hunting along the radio dial.

The number-one-selling car charger for iPod and iPhone, PowerJolt charges your iPod from your car's 12 volt power outlet while you use it. Its low-profile design takes up little room on your console or dash.  PowerJolt works for iPhone and all charge-by-USB iPod models. Got a 1st-generation iPod shuffle? Plug it directly into PowerJolt's USB outlet. Got a 2nd-generation iPod shuffle? Plug in the dock adapter that came with it. For other iPod models and iPhone, PowerJolt ships with a detachable USB Type-A to 30-pin dock connector cable, which can be used separately to connect your iPod or iPhone to your computer.  PowerJolt also works as a charger for many other devices that charge via USB, using the USB charging cable that shipped with your device. Just plug your device's cable into PowerJolt's USB port. 


..

34458735 bought this 2 years ago and it works great. can plug in 2 usb devices to charge or use and most usb cables will fit side by side (have found a couple that are bigger than standard that dont fit well). going to get more of these for each car

..

34458735 Can you use this with a USB connected item and play/charge your ipod at the same time?

Ridiculously over-engineered? Or the perfect case no matter where you're headed?We think it's a little bit of both.Simply put, Survivor is the most protective case we've ever built. Designed and tested to meet or exceed US Department of Defense Standard 810F, Griffin's Survivor Extreme-Duty Case is built from the inside out to protect your iPhone from extreme conditions ... dirt, sand, rain, shock, vibration and a host of other environmental factors.Survivor is built on a shatter-resistant polycarbonate frame clad in rugged, shock-absorbing silicone. A built-in screen protector seals your Multi-Touch display from the outside environment, while hinged plugs seal the dock connector, headphone port, hold switch and volume controls. A detachable heavy-duty clip secures your iPhone to a belt or bag strap.


..

34458735 I really like this case because it is very durable and has a built in screen. However as a result it's much heavier and bulkier, harder to fit in a pocket. I must stress that it is not waterproof!

..

34458735 Purchased on sale at Best Buy. Offers GREAT protection. I would definitely buy another. Ports and camera are relatively easy to access.

..

34458735 Very good product and great value! I especially like that it's waterproof.

..

34458735 Was cheap, should have let me know from the start it wasn't for me. When on the belt clip, it leaves the phone screen facing the front. That is a stupid design. Then it makes you sound muffled when you are talking to someone.

..

34458735 Good case,but it makes the phone too big to fit in your pocket

..

34458735 its durable, keeps phone safe, but hard to use the added features on the iPhone5s with its attached camera cover, the covered thumb-button and hard to open volume control.

..

34458735 don't like the moisture that gathers between the zagg shield on my phone and the shield that comes with the case

..

34458735 If you don't work in an office and do a lot of walking this is the one for you. Not good in pocket but in its clip it's secure.

..

34458735 Great product. Works fantastic. Would purchase again.

..

34458735 Great protection for my iPhone. It was very reasonably priced which made it even more appealing. It has a built in screen saver as well. My wife has a LifeProof case but I think this one is almost as good; just a bit bulkier...

..

34458735 Got this to replace an old cover. This one is well built, very solid. A bit more pricey but definitely worth the investment.

..

34458735 great protection for the ipod. kids broke two before we decided to upgrade cases. they haven't broke one since.

..

34458735 my daughter loves it its built very well it does the job it protects the ipod

..

34458735 We found this case after trying se others
Loved it and my girls loved it too

..

34458735 This is a great IPOD touch (4th generation) case. It is durable and protective. My only complaint is that it is hard to dis-assemble when it is on the IPOD touch, but it does its job!

..

34458735 So far it seems to be a good case. Luckily I don't think my child has really put it to the test. It comes off much easier than the otterbox so she can switch it out for cute cases sometimes. I have no complaints except for the fact that the only color carried was pink. Not all girls like that color.

..

34458735 My daughter goes through iTouch cases very quickly. They usually wear out due to use and removing and reinstalling them unnecessarily. She has not removed this case since the day it was brought home from Best Buy. Greatest case yet!

..

34458735 It is very rugged and my iPad fits well. It is priced well

..

34458735 Great protection for iPods. We are very happy because even the OtterBox didn't protect it from cracking. Like the colors and feel and it is not too bulky for my child's hands.

..

34458735 Nice price good quality. Used inside and out. Works well for keeping
My iPod safe.

..

34458735 At first, I wasn't a fan of this product. I didn't like how it covered the color of my iPod, and how it wasn't easy to put on my iPod. It has grown on me since it has done a really good job of protecting my iPod from my 2 small children. I have dropped it and so have they, and it has not gotten scratched or broken. I don't keep the screen protector on, because it made the iPod more difficult to use, but I will use the screen protector when I take my iPod to the beach. I would tell someone that buys this product to remember to take the camera cover off before taking pics. Sometimes I forget that there is a protective cover on it and think that my iPod's camera is broken.

..

34458735 Sturdy and pretty. I highly recommend this product.

..

34458735 Bought this to protect my daughters iPod. So far no problems, she is 8 and needed good protection :)

..

34458735 The case is very cool and sleek looking. It is also very sturdy and rugged.

..

34458735 I bought this for my son and it has done a great job of protecting his iPod. He is 12 years old and also thinks it "looks cool"

..

34458735 This case is great for protection for my sons ipod.

..

34458735 This does what you want it to do, protect your iPod.

..

34458735 The Survivor protects your iPod from just about anything.

..

34458735 This case is great for an ipod touch. With young kids it will protect the ipod.

..

34458735 I like the protection that the cover gives me. I would recommend it for guys mostly because they handle gadgets better

Outfit your Apple iPad mini in rugged protection with this Griffin Technology Survivor GB36292 case that features a rigid internal frame to guard against bumps and drops and an integral display shield that deflects wind and rain.


..

34458735 This was my original iPad mini case. I returned it the next day as it made the iPad too heavy, and the outside case was slimey to the touch

..

34458735 I have truly enjoyed the last two weeks with my new case. The color selection was exactly what I was looking for. I expected to pay more, but was pleasantly surprised. The case hugged the iPad mini very snug and tight. The screen protector allowed the the screen to still be sensitive to the lightest touches and gestures. To top it all off, there is a built in kick stand to support the device when watching a movie or reading, etc. I also remember there being a plug to cover the hole for the headphone jack and other parts. This served as a great way to keep dust and moisture out. Overall, a great case. You won't be disappointed. Unfortunately, it doesn't guard against theft. I lost my iPad Mini two weeks after I got the case. I never saw myself as wanting an iPad Mini since I have the iPhone and MacBook, but since it was a gift, I did enjoy it. Rest assured that when I buy another iPad Mini, I will also buy the exact same case. In the mean time, I'll miss you. May God have mercy on the evil person who stole it.

34458735 Purchased his along with an iPad mini; seems to be well constructed.

..

34458735 We bought this cover for my son's Ipad mini. It is very durable and offers great protection providing piece of mind in the event of a drop th Ipad is safe.

..

34458735 Love this product have it in blu and black for my kids devices

..

34458735 Overall, this is a good product. It provides great protection and is a great fit for the iPad Mini. My only complaint is that the sound is muffled slightly when playing music.

..

34458735 This is perfect for our two year old. Very durable!

..

34458735 This is a good substitute for a otterbox at half the price. Could use a full frontal cover like otterbox for maximum coverage.

Easily carry your Apple iPhone 5 with this Griffin Technology Survivor GB35678-2 case that features a detachable clip for attachment to a belt or pack strap. The hinged plugs seal your device's ports to help keep out dust and dirt.


..

34458735 I love the grip on this case. It is comfortable to hold as well.

..

34458735 This case was way to bulky. It was a great looking case

..

34458735 I loved the case in bright pink. It is very durable and looks great. It is tough, but I think the screen cover scratches easily as it was already scratched up when I got it home. I couldn't plug my stereo headsets into it and that is important to me because I listen to tracks that have tones in them that regular headphones or earbuds will not pick up.

Protect your Samsung Galaxy S 4 cell phone from harsh environmental factors with this Griffin Technology Survivor GB37804 case that features a shatter-resistant polycarbonate frame and silicone cladding to prevent damage due to shocks and drops.


..

34458735 fake product. Best Buy retun policy NO GOOD. 15 DAYS ONLY.

..

34458735 This is a nice looking case. Quality construction. waterproof. it is so tight you can not hear your phone when the case is on

..

34458735 Very well built, although I had to return the item after 3 weeks because the Hinge pin for the belt clip came out losing the spring that keeps the tension on the belt clip. I work in a dirty environment, and the Samsung S4 is NOT thick and can be broken easily so I opted for a strong case. I will put a dab of ABS glue on top of the ends of the "hinge pin" to keep it from happening again. Felt bad about returning a perfectly good case just because one lousy spring.

..

34458735 The sizes of cases don't bother me because I love knowing that my phone is protected and if that means a big case then so be it. But even I would say this case is a little big. Its bigger than the Otterbox defender which people complain about because they think that is big. But when it comes to protection this case is amazing. It is very good at keeping your device protected and clean and I love how if it accidentally fell I wouldn't need to worry about it at all. It won't fit in a pocket, but it will fit in a purse or bag and even then you wouldn't need to worry about your keys or anything else scratching it up. The only downside this case has that really bothered me was the sound quality. You will definitely notice the difference. I don't listen to music on my phone so that wasn't the issue but calling or receiving calls was terrible. The person on the other line couldn't hear me at all and i would barely hear them even with the volume all the way up. There is an easy fix to this which is just punching out the black "paper" things covering the ports where your speaker is and everything else. That way it'll all be open and the sound will be just fine but then your case loses the water resistant ability seeing how all the ports would now be open. But if that doesn't bother you then like i said its an easy fix for the sound quality. Your phone fits nice and snug in the case so you wont hear it bouncing around in there and you wont have to worry about it coming out if you were to drop it. I would recommend this case to a friend if they need really good protection and don't mind a big case.

..

34458735 Awesome case! Have used this type of case for other electronics and you can't go wrong with it.

..

34458735 i love this case. its very bulky, but i like that because i have big hands. btw, it basically doubles it size in width, maybe triples. if you like your slim galaxy s4, don't get this. the only thing i am annoyed by is that i have to take the case off to charge my pone. it isn't hard to take the case off, its just annoying to have to do it everyday. besides that it's an excellent case.

34458735 Got the iPod cover for my son for Christmas to go with the new iPod 5th generation. Very durable and a fun character. Has already protected the iPod from getting damaged.

..

34458735 I bought this case as a gift, I actually bought it more for the fun spongebob design rather than durability. The case is actually stronger than I thought and fits around the ipod tightly. Overall, its a better case than I thought for $14.99. It is actually half the price at Best Buy than it was at other retailers!

..

34458735 My daughters both got ipod touches for Christmas. My eldest daughter had requested a spongebob ipod, which of course they don't make. I found these spongebob cases online. Had to get my niece who lives in Colorado to get them for me and send them to England. They absolutely love them and keep the iPods we'll protected. I used the click and collect service with no problems at all. Would definitely buy from best buy again and would recommend this product. Just wish best buy had international delivery and I would probably buy more from them.

..

34458735 Seems to work well. Would just like for it to also have screen protection instead of having to buy the screen protector separately.

Use your car stereo's AUX port to listen to your iPod or listen and talk handsfree on your iPhone while you charge its battery. To charge, set your iPhone or iPod in TuneFlex's adjustable cradle. We've designed the cradle so that you can leave your iPhone or iPod in its case. TuneFlex's flexible steel neck adjusts to keeps your iPhone or iPod just where you want it, always within reach but never in the way. For great-sounding tunes, plug into your car stereo's AUX port with the included AUX/Mic cable. When a call comes in, just tap your iPhone to answer. The call audio plays through your car's speakers, and the cable's high-sensitivity microphone picks up your voice, loud and clear. Meanwhile, you can keep your hands on the wheel and your attention on the road.


..

34458735 I bought this thinking it was a great deal. For the price of an aux cable and car charger is the same price as this which also has a stand and mic. But, after only a few weeks of having it I noticed that sound was only playing out of one speaker. when i played with it, it only worked when I put the cord tight against the stand. Also the casing to the mic. broke off.
Then it tried to take it out and the car charger part got stuck in my outlet, and actually pulled out the casing of the outlet. Needless to say, its poorly made, and not worth it. Just go buy it all separately for a better use of your money.

..

34458735 The Good: The arm is pretty solidly built as is the car plug section. Griffin customer support is GREAT and sent us replacements no questions asked.
The Bad: The replacements were just as bad since the product has an inherently terrible design. The hinge that allows you to turn your iPhone doesn't hold the phone in place. It is COMPLETELY loose. There is no way to tighten it or to even place it like it is in the picture. Your phone just swings around and upside down at the slightest turn. If you have a center console like we do the phone will then smack hard against it. Our iPhone actually shattered from this and had to pay Apple another $150 to get it replaced out of warranty. The little microphone cable is VERY thin and delicate. It lasted about a month.
The Ugly: iPhone glass shattered all over my center console.
The Summary: I like Griffin products. I have many other accessories made by them. It is on this faith that I spent a little extra for this charger which was easily double the price of competing products. I was thoroughly disappointed and my faith in Griffin products has been damaged. Much like my iPhone. Customer support though was FANTASTIC so I hope this was just a one-off design lemon.
Thank you "Bill" from Griffin! YOU were awesome. Whomever designed the TuneFlex though...not so much.

..

34458735 i have had this hands free set for awhile now and when i first bought it i was told that the other person on the line couldn't hear me because it was to loud and they kept on hearing themselves talk as well. on the box it says cancels out road noise which is a lie to say the least. works great though for a holder for charging but that's it. not worth the money at all!

..

34458735 I've gone through 3 of these pieces of garbage. On each one the microphone unit gets damaged within anywhere from 2 weeks to 2 months and becomes unusable as a hands free. Still works great as a charger and a music player - but the microphone is WAY too fragile and breaks in a stiff wind. I bought others when they were still in the return period but now I'm stuck with this one and it's going as well. I'll definitely be replacing it with something of actual quality.

..

34458735 Holds phone tightly but tilts left or right depending on which way car turns, speaker for blue tooth ha big echo.

..

34458735 I had a previous model that used FM radio to play audio from my iPhone. I found it too difficult to find FM frequencies that would work well with it. Finally the goose-neck broke and I got it replaced at Best Buy under the manufacturer's warranty. This new model seems more sturdy and the audio input cable works much better than the FM transmitter (if your car has an AUX IN jack).

..

34458735 This is the 2nd Tune-Flex I have owned. I like the upgrade with the side holders for the iPhone. A little disappointed that they did not fix the problem of easy tipping when turning corners. Other than that, I am very happy with it!

..

34458735 I'm not too happy with this unit, I actually went out and bought the Bluetooth unit from Jabra which is much better. Don't waste your money on this one.

..

34458735 This unit said on the packaging that it would accomodate all iphone covers. I use a Otter box and it would not fit. Also the phone was in the cradle without the cover the flex arm was not strong enough to hold the phone up right. This product is not worth the money. i have already returned it.

..

34458735 Very tight in recepticle and worried about vehicle damage when removed often. Doesn't stay in place as well as I'd hoped. Broke the wire holder the first time I put the wire in.

An essential. Plug into your computer's USB port or a charging dock to recharge or sync your iPod or iPhone.Can be used with Griffin's PowerBlock and PowerJolt power products as an extra charging cable. Keep as a spare in the car, at the office, or anywhere. Coiled cable design saves space, discourages tangles.

34458735 The Best Buy website says that this is a 48" cable.
We ordered it and picked it up in the store and the box says 3' (36") and when the cable is out of the box it is a curly cue design like car chargers. Definitely NOT what I was expecting from the description provided. This will be returned to the store.

..

34458735 I have one of the original generations of iPod, but I lost my original cord. I purchased FOUR different sync cords through Apple at various stores, and they would charge, but NONE of them would sync my iPod. I even called Apple support for help to order an original cord from the back of some warehouse, but all they did was push me towards buying a newer iPod. This product is inexpensive, and syncs my ancient iPod! Thank you for saving me over $200!

..

34458735 This cable is way too short for the car. I thought from the description it would be longer but you cannot have it charging and talk on your phone.

..

34458735 This is a neat way of conecting the IPod to the car system.

..

34458735 This replaces an original iPod charger/sync cable and seems to be better quality on the connector to the cord (doesn't fall apart from the cord), but it's only drawback is that it doesn't extend very far from the usb port while charging and gets pulled back towards the computer because of the coiling of the cord. Just means if has to be within 8 - 10 inches of the usb port.

..

34458735 This accessory is great if you plan to use/charge your iPod right next to you, such as when using a laptop. BUT for any other use where you might have to stretch the cord, this is not a good buy.
I like the color and the spiral design of the cord, but the cord is too short.

..

34458735 Bought the cord to use with Griffin car charger. I like the cord is curled so it doesn't get tangled. It's been working great since I bought it.

..

34458735 I bought this cable to connect my iphone to my car stereo and it worked like a charm and i loved how short it is. I hated using the original cable in my car because it was way too long and it was a hassle untangling it from the dashboard. About 3 weeks after i purchased it i noticed it would sometimes disconnect my iphone from my car while i was driving and i thought nothing of it. Then it did it more frequently and it became more and more irritating but i was working so much i didn't have time to get it replaced. Now the cable is totally dead and it does not charge/sync when it is connected to my car stereo and when i connect it to my laptop i get a warning from windows saying "USB power surge on hub port. One of the USB device has exceeded the power limits". I believe there is a short in the cable and now i need to contact Griffin and get it replaced because its been more than a month since i bought the cable from BestBuy...

..

34458735 This wasn't bad but I had a few issues where the connector felt like it was going in and out and charging. Just this past week while on a call, it kept hanging up if I tried to mute or even dial a number. After unplugging it, the phone worked fine. Happened just that one day.

..

34458735 Very simple... It's a good cheap replacement for the apple sync/charge cables...

Safeguard your Kindle Fire or Kindle Fire 7" with this Hard Candy Cases Print Series case that features durable polycarbonate material for reliable protection. The play-through design allows easy access to your device's features.


..

34458735 I got mine and my sister's had to hsve one too. So I ordered three more. I will say only order from best buy. I tried to order direct from hard candy cases and I never received them. You can't reach the company! Thank gooness for best buy.

..

34458735 The Kindle snaps into a case that protects only the back on the device. There is no cover for the screen making it difficult to transport in a purse or briefcase. Also, the Kindle will only lay flat in this case. There is no support or stand built into the case.

..

34458735 For some odd reason this item would not work with any other Hawking Technology items (specifically the wi-fi Dish thing) The high pitch noise that was made by this item was unbearable, so I had to return it.

..

34458735 I reviewed the product online before I bought it, I saw where other's had a very high pitch noise when ever plugged in. I also found the high pitch sound about the same decible as a computer fan. Not so bad for a computer room but I wouldn't want it in my office or bedroom.
I took it back to BB thinking maybe it was just that one, but the replacement had it too. I tried all three in the store and they all do it, but I kept it because of the increased signal strength.
Hawking support says there should be no noise emitted and offered to replace it. I didn't take the offer, what are the chances another would be different.
I haven't tested the new distance, but it nearly doubled the signal strength of a low signal.

..

34458735 Extended my range from router in the basement to over 600 feet away from the house!

..

34458735 I just purchased this product it works great, i had only two bars now i have between four and five, i really recommend this signal booster, this is the best signal booster i had tried

..

34458735 I live in a 4 story house, with a Verizon DSL wireless router in the basement. Had terrible connection in the upper stories of house, and I did a LOT of research before settling on this product. I purchased it, and the setup couldn't be easier. Disconnect the antenna from your wireless product (I disconnected the antenna from the DSL router), connect the included cable to the router and the device, connect the included antenna to the device, plug it in, and see the results. I went from 1 bar on the top floor to 5 bars instantly.
Before you buy, check your router or other wireless device to see what type of connection it uses. My router uses a RP-SMA connector (if you're not sure what type of connection you have, google "Common Wireless Antenna Connectors" to see pictures of the various types). The included cable is for RP-SMA connections, and if your's is different, you will need an adapter.
The only downside with this product is that the included cable is short (about 2 feet), but that wasn't a problem for me.
I would highly recommend this product if you are experiencing connection problems.

..

34458735 My laptop only had 1 bar on the signal and tried several things before this purchase. With this little device I have 4 -5 bars all the time. Great product.

..

34458735 This product is well worth the money. I had low bars on my computer throughout much of my house till I hooked this up to my wireless router. Now I have full bars no matter where I go. I have a Big house 2 stories with 4 bedrooms 2 living rooms and the usual 2 bath and kitchen. I get signal no matter where i was even at the other end of the house up stairs farthest away from the router.
*BUY THIS PRODUCT*
I gave this product 5 stars because with this great of reception I can handle a little humming

..

34458735 I just purchased a playstation 3 and was getting about a 45% signal from my Linksys wireless router. I kept geeting booted while playing online due to the week signal. The only reason why I'm giving this product 4 stars, is because there is no SMA to TNC adapter. Theis is the adapter that will fit on the back once you remove your router's antenna. The booster comes with a skinny TNC cable, so I had to go to another electronic store searching for this antenna adapter. After completing my quest, I proceeded with the easy installation as directed. My signal increase 90% !!!

..

34458735 Picked it up at a local store. Had a weak signal out on the deck. Hooked it up, full bars! Flawless! Thanks.

..

34458735 Plugged everything in properly and either the booster itself or the power converter was defective. Limited availability in the stores so I might have to go back online to re-order. A pain in the keester all the way around.
Oh, and when I called tech support they just couldn't believe it was defective. So much for Quality Control.

The HWREN1 effectively doubles the operating distance of your entire wireless network. Whether its an area in your home that has limited or no wireless coverage or a warehouse in your office, the Hawking Wireless-300N Range Extender takes the signal from your wireless access point and retransmits it at a higher rate. Simply place the Range Extender halfway between your Wireless Access Point and wireless trouble spot.


..

34458735 Was set up within 10 ft of the gateway and depending on the position it barely detected the gateway signal. Much farther away detection signal would come and go.

..

34458735 This product was very easy to setup and use but lacks the range that was promised and expected. According to CNET's review this was supposed to be the best out there, so much for that. I have my wireless router located in my basement, directly above it I get an excellent connection on my notebook. However, just 30 feet away, down a hall, I get low to very low on a desktop. I placed the hawking extender about 12 feet down that hall and I get at best very good. This thing has less than 20 feet to blast a signal and I only get very good. Based on the reviews from others I expected to place it upstairs and get an excellent signal throughout my upper level. I get as good a signal from the router as I do the Hawking in the rest of my upper level.

..

34458735 Needed extended range for my daughter in the basement of a two story house. The router was on the opposite side of the house, upstairs. Purchase went well, set up was easy, and it extended the range enough that she is now using the Internet in her room. No wires, no hassle, just right.

..

34458735 Plug and Play and worked well for a couple of days. When a connection issue started on day 3, I called their customer support (offshore). The person was rude, unhelpful and after a hour finally said it was a defective system (I think it was more a case of not wanting to spend any time on the phone), and for me to return it. I look at products hollistically. not just the item but the suport of the company, and I can say that HAWKING have a real issue on their hands with their support. Unfortunately this reflects on Best Buy, who need to consider this type of feedback when decidiing on vendors.

..

34458735 Very easy to configure and install. Solved my problem in all the rooms where the wireless signal was weak. Very good cost x benefit ratio.

..

34458735 Okay...
I've had major issues with an old house with dead spots and connectivity issues with my current Linksys N Router. Part of the issue is that imy prime base of operation is on the first floor at one end f the house. My family has a tough time connecting to the internet up in our family room which is the farthest place from the router.
I followed the easy instructions and placed the wireless extender about 50 feet from my N-router... It's great! I have no more deadspots and I couldn't be more thrilled with it.

..

34458735 CAUTION: Remember the following for an easy installation and setup. If you have a dual band wireless N router, meaning that G is transmitted on the 2.4 GHz band and N is transmitted on the 5 GHz band, then you will need to change your mode. Change your dual band wireless N router to operate both G and N signals on 2.4 GHz band. Kind of sucks, but oh well. This product does not read/operate on 5 GHz band. I changed my router mode, it found the signal just fine, and now enjoying 300 MB/s in a much larger area in my home. You might want to consider upgrading the antennas on the device to 7 dbi gain, but the default antennas should work just fine in most all home/small office environments.

..

34458735 I loved this experience....after a quick setup, i plugged it in, and it worked! I was surprised. If you have dead/low reception areas, this is a simple to use, quality solution. Now....if hawking or Best Buy would only pay me for this real-life endorsement!!! :P

..

34458735 When I first set up the Range Extender, it worked with one of my 2 laptops, and it worked great. Then, it stopped working and tech support asked me to download an update to the software. It took tech support to help me install the software update. The update worked and I also had both laptops working. Now, after several months both laptops cannot connect to the signal. I've spent a lengthy about of time on the phone with tech support and I'm returning the product. Overall, it's good when it works, but it doesn't seem to work consistently and there is no good explanation why.

..

34458735 The extender worked great for a couple of months. Then, the power input became irractic, not the power supply, but the power input on the extender. After a frustrating tech support phone call, I sent the extender back to Hawking. I had to pay $10 for another unit to be shipped. After the replacement came in, it will only transmit data for a short period of time, as in 10-15 seconds. This thing has been a big waste of time and money for me.

34458735 Overall, I am happy with my Hello Kitty flash drive. It's cute.

..

34458735 I bought this Hello Kitty USB flash drive for my music storage in my vehicle. All the music is categorized and the music titles are displayed on my vehicle screen. When I use my CD player it doesn't read the music titles like this flash drive. I would definitely recommend this great compact storage to anyone.

..

34458735 I love using it for saving my homework. Its convenient.

..

34458735 Works great and is priced reasonably. My little 9-year-old girl loves it.

..

34458735 Lots of compliments on the design, makes it easy to find and keep track of for use

..

HP W2271d 21.5" LED LCD Monitor - 16:9 - 1920 x 1080 - 600:1 - Full HD


..

34458735 Pros: It is vesa compatible, Came without any failed pixels, and it has a matte finish to both the screen and the frame.
Cons: At it's brightest you get a dull grey color. this monitor CANNOT do a true white at all. Darkest is a deep grey, CANNOT do a true black. I have played with settings on the monitor as well as with my graphics adapter. I am running 2 way sli gtx 770 and neither the nvidia settings nor the onboard intel can do a thing to help it out.
If you have nothing else to compare it to it might be acceptable but because of the lack of range it can create a strain on your eyes even reading text on a document especially if there are other light sources(though still not as bad as if it were a glossy screen.

..

34458735 the print quality is good, it's easy to set up and use.

..

34458735 Great basic printer that works well for what I need! The design is nice and doesn't take up too much space. Seemed to be reasonably priced as well.

..

34458735 This printer is not e-print compatible, hp-printables does not work with this machine.

..

34458735 I bought it for my son, he needed a printer and it was the perfect printer for his home office! It scans and is fun to use!

..

34458735 I've had to reinstall several times, it shows spooling and then goes away without printing. Printing is very slow either usb or wireless installed. I've had several HP printers and have never had this much trouble printing. It works sometimes and then it stops. It seems like it might be a power issue with the printer.

..

34458735 It was easy to set up and to use. It can print from multiple sources which is nice because I have four kids with all different thing they want to print from.

..

34458735 A basic printer compact good for a replacement. Can be a bit complex to know ink levels due to no screen display have to use awkward chart cut to find out how much ink is left.

..

34458735 I don't do much printing but I wanted something reliable. I hope this printer will turn out to be better than the old HP printer I had.

..

34458735 This was a gift for my mother in the nursing home. She enjoys looking at the pictures as they flip and showing her family off to visitors. We were very surprised to see that it also had a digital clock and it is large enough that she can read it from across the room.
We did find it difficult to load the pictures on the memory as different members of the family brought memory sticks to place pictures on it for her. Once loaded it works wonderfully.

..

34458735 It gets annoying that it blows up the pictures that are the vertical with the frame horizontal. I'd prefer to see the whole picture small than only a middle segment. I'd recommend, but with the disclaimer if that would bother you too much.

..

34458735 this item is very unique and classy elegant for a work gift. the only con I have is it has to be plugged in at all times in order for it to work. Other than that this item is definitely worth purchasing. I would definitely recommend a digital photo frame for every household.

..

34458735 The first one of these I received was damaged out of the box. No problem returning to Best Buy at the store, where the promptly ordered me a new one with out an issue. The product is ok. The display is clear and the color is nice, but the order of pictures is dictated by alphabetical order and there is no option to randomize the order. On top of this, the pictures that are in portrait format get cropped to fit the landscape layout of the frame. That is aggrevating as I have a lot of pictures that are in portrait layout. I am planning on keeping it as the price was right and the quality seems ok.

..

34458735 The frame is Easy to set up and use. The screen looks great. The only downfall is it Doesn't auto format pics to fit frame.

..

34458735 I needed to buy a gift for someone who has just about everything. The digital photo frame is a really nice gift because you, or the recipient, can easily personalize it. I got a real deal when I bought it (half price). The quality and appearance are excellent. I had a lot of fun loading pictures of interest to the recipient. One issue I had was that there was no detailed instruction manual in the box. I got an instruction manual online, and I also played around with it, finally figuring out how to use all its features. I think manufacturers assume that consumers are really tech savvy with this type of equipment. At any rate, I was extremely pleased with this purchase, and so was the birthday boy who received it.

..

34458735 Everything works the way I wanted it to. I've got a few different digital frames and they all have been wonderful.

..

34458735 The picture stand isn't all that great and once plugged in it can be a little annoying to have free standing, but considering the price it's not a bad deal if you're looking for a quick and simple gift

..

34458735 Great budget digital picture frame. Looks really good but is a little difficult to setup initially. This was by far the cheapest frame I could find that had internal but still accepted external memory as well.

..

34458735 This is not the item I originally ordered, and after returning it 2x, found out that the version I did want is no longer available. Ordered the correct item but the wrong item was supplied. Customer Service was wonderful in helping out and providing return labels, etc. Absolutely NO complaint about those who helped through the process...just disappointed that we can't get the version of this frame we wanted.

34458735 Very nice printer for my needs. I like that it was easy for me to set up and connect to my Applet products.

..

34458735 We did receive a bad cartridge but after calling HP they shipped a new XL cartridge over night. Prints great quality.

..

34458735 The printer was easy to set up and connects to our laptops and phones.

..

34458735 I LOVE this printer! I've scanned all my bills in and love the printables HP offers like coupons and crosswords. It's very quiet, compact, and prints both sides without having to manually feed the paper back in. The only thing that bothers me sometimes is that the printer doesn't respond occasionally unless you turn it off and back on. Also, it sometimes stops printing in the middle of a document and then I have to wait a minute or two for it to finish. Overall it's great for the price though!

..

34458735 This product is great for basic scanning/printing/copying documents and photos. I would recommend this product. This product is wireless and easy to use.

..

34458735 We love this printer. It frees up a USB port since it supports wireless printing. The auto ink delivery program is quite a deal. And it was very easy to setup.

..

34458735 I love the wireless aspect, love the fact that it is compact and works well with my new computer. I like the print quality, its clear and reliable.

..

34458735 This is an average printer, set up fairly easy, did well printing from ipot\d
had difficulty printing from I phone.
print ink reasonable price
nice feature is that it has a web site to help explain set up

..

34458735 This printer seems only to print in dark tones, regardless of adjustments I make to improve the photo, it comes out dark each time. I've wasted a lot of ink and photo paper because of it. The paper feed for photo paper or any paper that isnt letter size is difficult to align properly.

..

34458735 This replaced my workhorse HP5P that I'd had for about a million years. Has same basic functionality, plus wireless capabilities. It's fast and prints well. I haven't been through my first toner cartridge yet, so I can't say how efficient it is (suppose I could look it up...) but overall I'm very happy with this product. It is a bit large, but it's still smaller than what it replaced.

..

34458735 Only problem is the inability to set-up wireless printing. Must use USB cable to print.

..

34458735 I have only owned this printer for a few weeks, but so far, so good. Had to purchase this printer as my smaller laser was not compatible with an upgrade on our industry-specific software. It interfaced perfectly, and speed of printing is good.

..

..

34458735 This Pro 400 is super fast, really digging that , but software is lame , and second tray doesn't always show up.

..

34458735 Printing is fast with high quality text printing. I have had no problems since set-up no problems.

..

34458735 I have no manual. I am not sure if this printer scans.

..

34458735 Overall very good printer, picture quality is very good, easy to setup and start using.

..

34458735 Overall love the printer. Fourth HP I've had, only one isn't in service anymore. Serves purpose well for my needs, 11x17 and 13x19 size prints of CAD drawings. Helps cut waste of my 36" plotter. Downside is it's a similar machine to rest of HP's all-in-one's but on steroids. Bulky, but doesn't nearly outweigh the use I'm getting from it. Other complaint I have is I'm not a fan of the HP eprint interface, it can be handy I suppose but if you read all their fine print they really overstep your privacy boundaries.

..

34458735 Excellent clarity in printing photos as well as Adobe Illustrator files in color and large format. The scanning of documents to a PDF is quick with the automatic document feeder. The unit can be controlled from the panel on the unit or by the supplied program installed on my desktop. The large surface scanning area was great to scan a very large sketching in two parts that I was able to stitch together in Photoshop. The only negative for this unit is that it does not have the capability to scan 35 mm slides.

..

34458735 I needed a printer for 11" x 17" paper. I originally bought another manufacturers printer from BestBuy - mainly on price, but it only took 11" x 17" paper through a slot at the back, one sheet at a time, and the paper kept jamming. Also the scanner would only scan letter size paper. It was a pile of junk so I returned it.
I next bought the HP 7610 from BestBuy online, the price was $249.99. Between placing my order and picking the printer up at my local BestBuy store the printer had gone on sale for $149.99 - and BestBuy gave me the sale price. A really great bargain. Thank you BestBuy.
Now to the printer. It is big, so you need enough space to accommodate it. And it is a bit heavy.
Set-up was real easy. In fact, the printer connected up automatically to my network - I didn't have to do anything except follow the onscreen instructions.
Print quality is superb - and quick. The scanner glass takes 11" x 17" paper, and the scanning is quick too. You can save the scan as a jpeg, a pdf or to email. Copying is also good as well. I don't use the fax feature, so I cannot comment on that.
I like the automatic document feeder #ADF#, it is very efficient, but it will only take 81/2" wide letter paper, that is a bit of a pain for me, but I can live with it.
There is only one paper tray, so you will have to keep changing the paper, if like me, you use different paper sizes. But again, that is something that I can live with.
I cannot comment on ink consumption as I have only had the printer for a short time, and I am still using the ink cartridges that came with the printer.
Overall, I am really pleased with my HP 7610. It gets the job done with the minimum of fuss, and at the sale price of $149.99 it is a real steal.
I also purchased the 4 year extended warranty
If you are looking for a printer for 11" x 17" paper then this is a great printer - so I would suggest you go and get one, especially while it is on sale.

..

34458735 I bought this because the description says "Digital (DVI-D with HDCP and HDMI with HDCP) and standard analog (VGA) inputs". I assumed this meant VGA, DVI, and HDMI inputs. It only has VGA and DVI inputs. There is no HDMI input.
I will most likely return this product.

..

34458735 I purchaed (2) of these for use with my HP Laptop, so that I could have 3 screens. To set up I had to purchase a VGA to USB adapter (which Best Buy does not sell) for one of the monitors.
Three weeks after getting the monitors I had to replace my laptop. New HP laptop does not have a VGA out so I had to purchase a DVI to HDMI adapter (which Best Buy does not sell).
New monitor really should have a HDMI or USB input.

..

34458735 bought 2 of these for dual screen, awesome picture quality would buy a third if I had the space for one. like the slim design and brushed sliver frame. a little bothered there was no HDMI input since its stated on the specs on the bestbuy website. but I've always used the DVI inputs on my PC.

..

34458735 This is a great monitor. The resolution is really good. It also matches the mac mini I put it on. When I need another monitor I will definitely get another one of these.

34458735 I got a sale price on this 27 inch monitor and it was an excellent choice. Excellent picture.

..

34458735 I upgraded from an HP w2207 22" monitor and couldn't be happier. Actually, I am running dual-monitors now. The 2711x is awesome. The size is great and I got it during a "2-day sale" so I got an excellent price on it. I am a big fan of HP monitors. Their screens seem "brighter" and "shinier" than other brands, and I like that. I mostly play MMO video games, so this upgrade was great for me. The only negative thing about it is the fact that you can't adjust the base like you can on the 2207h, but it's not that big of a deal. Also there are no built-in speakers, but who uses those anyway?

..

34458735 I already had a HP 24 " monitor that worked super. In fact, the frame is even better then the 27" one I just purchased.. But I am growing older and older and I use my computer for many things, I even used my computer to watch the baseball playoffs until they started to broadcast them on antenna tv. Anyway I have a super computer and now I have a large clear monitor to watch with. I have an ATI Graphic Control Center with presets that I created. Yes, I love the whole set up that I purchased at a bargain price from Best Buy with free delivery to my front door.
I am a 5 star pleased customer with this transaction.

34458735 This 27-inch monitor is great for displaying two documents at a time or displaying architectural drawings.

..

34458735 I have had problems with HP monitors in the past being very grainy and poor image quality. This monitor finally meets the mark in picture quality and price.

..

34458735 Very please with my HP 27"monitor, taking me into the two monitor world - I only wish I has purchased two 27" twins -- even better!!

..

34458735 The monitor has beautiful color depth, the price was excellent but the stand lacks any height adjustment.

..

34458735 I replaced my dual 19 inch monitor setup with this monitor and I am glad that I did

..

34458735 I bought this monitor at a great sale price and it has exceeded my expectation but a large margin. It is a very clear monitor, doesn't generate any heat to speak of, and I can read without reading glasses now. It does take up a lot of desk real estate, but that is the nature of large monitors. wish I had bought this monitor a long time ago.

..

34458735 I have been away from Best Buy for the last 2 years as I felt Best Buy was not the best value available in the market. On my recent comparison shopping, however, I discovered that Best Buy became very competitive and I was lured to the site. Great product and great service at great price made me happy to be back.

..

34458735 I am normally an Apply fan, but I wanted to get an Android based tablet just to have one. I will say that I am rather impressed by this tablet. The battery life is great, the stylus is awesome, and the sound is rather decent for its size. My only problem is with the screen. While it does look ok, I can see a difference between say the Nexus 7. I will say that I still prefer my Apple products, but all in all its an enjoyable experience.

..

34458735 What can be said about this tablet other then its one of the best 7" tablets on the market.
only to its clone (The Tegra Note 7) and Google's Nexus 7 2013. for the price, performance and features you cant go wrong.

34458735 This has been a great addition to my tablet and is worth the money.

..

34458735 Couldn't seem to give up my keyboard .. so simply being able to type is a big plus! Also extends the tablets battery life, perfect for when I am on the go!! I absolutely love it .. No complaints.

..

34458735 I really like this transformer concept for the tablet. Increases the ways to use the tablet. Easy to dock and remove.

..

34458735 I purchased the ASUS Transformer tablet for my wife as a Christmas gift, and she loves it, but had difficulty using online forms. Enter keyboard docking station! It is very easy to attach to the tablet, and once fully charged (the keyboard has a separate battery which also powers the tablet), useful combined battery life for the tablet is nearly doubled. If you've been using a tablet exclusively, you get into the habit of touching the screen for certain functions, like going back a page or closing an app. The keyboard has buttons for these which are easier to use, once you break the old habit.
Two drawbacks - though the keyboard and tablet can fold together like a regular laptop, the pivot point on the keyboard is very stiff. Also, the addition of the keyboard means having to get a different sleeve for the tablet; not a big deal if you haven't been using a snug-fitting sleeve to begin with, but can be a pain if you are.

..

34458735 I bought this with the Transformer Infinity Tablet and it was well worth it. Not only do you know have an actual keyboard, but it increases the battery life of the tablet.

..

34458735 works good, i have not had any troubles. helps with the touch screen problems i was haveing. large fingers little spaces.

..

34458735 Awesome product that makes using the tablet more like using a computer

34458735 Great product and an excellent value. This was a gift for my wife and she loves it. Don't over pay for an apple product. This tablet does everything you could possibly want and more. Even or 3 year old cam operate it with ease.

..

34458735 My kids absolutel;y love this tablet. they download alot of games. Very easy to manage.

..

34458735 I had a previous Android tablet that finally failed. While looking through reviews and testing the actual product in the store, I had my heart set on another model tablet when the salesperson asked if I had considered the ASUS MeMO Smart. I was blown away by the crisp graphics and how light the tablet was. SOLD!

..

34458735 I am glad to have gotten this. Would buy it again.

..

34458735 Bought this tablet for my wife as a birthday present. Principle use was to do basic web browsing, and to connect to our tv to watch movies on netflix, youtube,etc. After a few days of working fine, the internet failed to connect. All other devices at our home connected fine. We took it to a few public places to connect to their wi-fi and could not. We took the tablet back to have them look at it, and they said it was fine. We tried again and even asked a few tech savy little brothers, and they both concluded the tablet was the issue. We finally returned it and got a different insignia model that cost less, and has given us no issues.

..

34458735 I purchased this after spending several weeks reading reviews. I didn't want an iPad because I'm Android-oriented. I compared the Asus Memo to the Galaxy Tab 3 and found the benefits to exceed the Tab. The key selling point were the reviews indicating the that the Memo didn't have the root app overload of the Tab, which is a plus.
I haven't had any problems with my screen protector effecting functionality or anything like that. The speakers are great, but I wish that there was an external volume control.
I just discovered the multi-user option so that each user can download his on apps and emails.
I'm quite satisfied with my purchase.

..

34458735 For my first tablet compared to the Samsung galaxy this is just mind blowing. The picture quality is to line, what's even better is the screen has the gorilla glass and my dog has jumped on it several times and not one scratched it. It picks up wifi very easily. The setting features are easy to understand and to use. The camera on this tablet takes very good night time pictures. Over alk this is an easy and user tablet for its price!

..

34458735 This is a good tablet for the money, I like the choice of applications for the Android OS.

34458735 The display was broken right off the bat - everything looks like a cheesy 70's movie or an internet site from 1992. Happens particularly with the color red - almost like it can only show red in 8-bit for some reason - though blue is fine. I updated the graphics driver but that didn't fix it. Returning this first thing in the morning. Very disappointing laptop.

..

34458735 The store help was a little slow in ordering. the product is great. Just had to order and wait about five days for it to be delivered. the stores don't carry the product.

You don't have to wear skinny jeans or be on a ridiculously restricted diet to have a lean look! The Luxe Lean hard-shell, snap-on case will give your iPod an unbelievably sleek exterior (not posterior), without a single trip to the gym! The stunning metallic faade, velvety feel, and lithe frame allow access to all buttons, ports, and sensors.


..

34458735 And the reason I had to purchase a second case, is because my first case took 2 bad falls. That should tell you why I came back for a second. The first impact cracked the case, but my iPod remained intact. The next case, not so bad. Broke my case (where it was already Cracked), and I guess because of the angle, chipped the bottom of my iPod.
My guess is, this little case saved it from more severe damage that could have been done.
It is a beautiful, sleek and modern design. The case has a nice, smooth feel, great for slippery hands. My only complaint is this. The first case I purchaed was a beautiful dark blue color. After handling it so much, the color was starting to fade on the points where my fingers would hold it the most.
Other than that visual distraction, I would say it was well worth the full retail price I paid at the store. This less expensive one online was a bargain for the price.

..

34458735 This is the fourth iPod Touch (gen 4) case I've bought. I was looking for something that offered protection but also was comfortable to carry in a pocket. This is the one! It meets those criteria but also offers a much more secure "hand feel". The chrome iPod back has always felt slippery to me. This case solves that problem.

..

34458735 Bought the pink case, great color, and it also makes it easy to handle the iPod while playing, however I am disappointed with the how well it protects my iPod, it leaves scratches on the back of the original iPod case, I bought it to protect my iPod, so I am a little disappointed. :O(

..

34458735 Looks great and fits great, too. Price is reasonable when you find it on sale.

..

34458735 I love this case's feel in my hand. Its almost like a soft rubber, not a hard plastic. The finish, when new, is very bright and cool. Almost iridescent. I have a small fabric pouch that I use to carry my ipod touch around in to protect the screen. The finish has worn off in the front of the case in less than a month. The material underneath is white, so when the dark blue gets rubbed off, its noticeable. If you like the feel of this case like I do, choose a very light color. Then it won't matter when the finish wears off.

The iW2 also supports charging and local audio playback via USB by using the USB sync cable that comes with new iPods, iPhones and iPads.


..

34458735 I bought the iHome as a gift on 9/16/12! So I have given it time to work as advertised! It does not work very good on air-play mode! I have tried re- booting, re-installing app, still it will work some time then nothing, the sound is good, not great but it is ok! The Bose Dock & Harman/Kardon have much better sound! I would not recommend this product to anyone due to the issues I have every time I try to use the iHome player! Unit is way over priced for the quality!

..

34458735 For only $107.99? Are you kidding me? This is a great price for an AirPlay speaker! The sound quality is awesome for the price. I listened to the iHome iW2 and the Bose AirPlay speakers. I mean of course the Bose sounds better. If you don't want to spend like $300-$400 for an AirPlay speaker, this is a great alternative! I did not have any issues stated in the previous reviews. Easy to set up on a network, doesn't lose connectivity, and I am able to bring the speaker anywhere in my house. The only complain I have about this unit is that it does not have an indicator of the bass and treble.

..

34458735 The wireless connection takes a very long time to connect to my ipad. When it does connect the speaker will cut in and out. I would not reccommend this to someone who is looking for a plug and play speaker. This past week I gave up on the wireless and am using a 1.5mm stereo cord. Save yourself money and buy a $50 corded non wireless speaker.

..

34458735 Nice sound but difficult to set up and does stay connected to WiFi when moving the unit. Don't recommend for those who are used to real Plug and Play

..

34458735 I like the sound quality it produces, it suits my need. But most annoying thing is - to move room to room every time I unplug/plug it doesnot sense the wifi though I am moving this device with in my wifi zone. I have to click the button in the back to enable the wifi. And ipad/iphone doesnot sync up automatically. Need to spend some time everytime to sync up - really frustrating.
Definitely there are some good products out there in market in this price range. I will not recommend that.

..

34458735 This unit is greatly over priced for the quality of sound it produces. It was somewhat difficult to set up too.

..

34458735 I wanted to use this product to bring sound to the back yard, but unfortunately the wireless connectivity was very spotty in an area where our other devices (iPhone, iPad) work perfectly, going to have to take it back and look at alternatives.

..

34458735 I use this product in my Kitchen behind a family picture frame. This speaker was easy to set up and the sound is awesome. My WiFi router is in a drawer, so I find that when I open that drawer my connection is better. There isn't anything like airplay!

..

34458735 Just bought this because it would do wireless streaming around the house and has a remote (this is very important to me). It works pretty well after setup. Holds a pretty solid connection to WiFi.
The only problem is that you have to constantly set the Iphone or Ipad device to "iHome speaker" every time you turn on your Apple device. Also, the volume could be a little louder. But for the price you can't beat it.

34458735 Well built hybrid PC/tablet by Asus.
Perhaps, another hybrid with larger screen and RAM will attract mobile user.

..

34458735 I ordered the Asus T-100 last week and I was anxiously waiting for its arrival. When it arrived and I opened the box, I was impressed with the overall look of the keyboard/tablet combo. However, that is where I stopped being impressed. It took me over three hours to set it up. First the tablet didn't want to connect with Microsoft live. (And yes, before you tell me that the wireless was not working correctly on my cable system, I have 5 other laptops and tablets connecting to the internet without any problems).
After numerous reboots, I was able to finally connect. Then came the download issues. First, my Kaspersky didn't want to download. It continuously hung at 30%. Again, after numerous reboots I was able to get it to install. Now came the antivirus updates. Again, it hung at 30%. Are you beginning to see a pattern here? After numerous reboots, it finally updated. I tried to install several Microsoft applications and had a lot of issues getting them to install.
When using the tablet, I was disappointed in the screen display. I know, you get what you pay for, however, I expected a little better. I will say the keyboard is good.
Bottom Line: I either got a lemon with wireless issues or this is the way it is. I took it back and purchased a HP Split. I really wanted this to work.

..

34458735 While this product serves its purpose, it was really easy to crack the screen (it literally only slid off my bed onto the carpet...smh). They don't have an exact case/cover that fits...only sleeves (the ones on amazon don't fit well). The software is great, the value is great, the battery life is great also...but I highly recommend the protection plan.

..

34458735 It performs as I had hoped. It would be easier to learn if I could find an owners manual. Downloaded one that is not very complete or helpful. Would be happy if Best Buy could provide suggestions upon purchase of new electronics. Fun to use and convenient both at home and away. Like the detachable keyboard. Upon purchase no mention of cases or screen protectors was made.

..

34458735 When I first got this laptop, I was very impressed. It was ready to use right out of the box, Windows 8.1 meant that it literally set itself up once I logged in with my Microsoft account, and the performance exceeded my expectations. I originally got this to replace my Android Tablet, but with the added convenience of the keyboard, the ability to run full Windows applications, and the full license for Office, I find myself using it for my primary home computer. I've been delighted with this for almost a month.
One day I noticed what looked like a small crack on the screen. When I touched the screen, that crack spread to become a split all the way across the screen. I didn't drop or abuse the laptop in any way.
This was after Best Buy's return policy, so I contacted Asus to start an RMA for the defective screen. I haven't heard back from then, so I'm really disappointed. If they come through and fix the laptop, then I'll update my review.
So -- I still recommend the laptop, but if you buy it, spend the extra money and get a protection plan for it!!!

..

34458735 This is a great buy and the computer is great! Windows 8 is not user friendly and was frustrating to set up.

..

34458735 I'm not a computer geek, but I found this device perfect for my needs.

..

34458735 The ASUS T100 is very compact, great for travel! Also, coverts to a tablet quickly. It comes with a Microsoft Office code, no additional expense for that software. Got a Bluetooth mouse, Gear Head, to use with the T100. They pair together great, but sometimes after idle or shutdown they disconnect and I have to resync. Not a big deal because the touch pad works great. Added an additional 64GB with a micro SD card. If you like small, this T100 would work for you.

..

34458735 I bought this to use as a portable battery powered speaker for my IPad2. Not being tethered to wires was the goal. Decent sound, but not audiophile, quality was the expectation. This is a set of speakers with good sound. There is depth and clarity if sound that was surprising considering the small size of the speakers. The speaker phone capability is a nice bonus. I haven't make a call with it, but have listened to messages. If there is a downfall it would be the short life of the batteries. After about 4 hours they begin to fail. Rechargeable batteries are a must. Using the plug when an outlet is handy is a good idea.

34458735 I got this product for Christmas and I have had it for 5 months. I have been very happy with these speakers! I just pulled them out and decided I should write a review to help any apprehensive buyer. These speakers are great! The battery life is about 12 hours on medium volume and the speakers themselves are very compact. If you are looking to make some noise on the go these are perfect! I can blast music and hear it through my friend's whole house! They are easily as loud as my desktop speakers. The sound quality my not be as good as stationary speakers, but they have better sound quality than any other portable speakers. They are easily comparable to mid range desktop speaks. In a nut shell, these are easily the best portable speakers available.

..

34458735 For its size, it is surprising to have such a good sound quality. It is really nice.
The big drawback though is that the cord between the jack plug and the USB is short that you cannot charge it while using it.

34458735 I have no complaints it makes the coffee quickly, is compact, and the color is beautiful. I preferred this over the system with the water reservoir as I don't drink a lot of coffee so having to refill for every cup isn't a problem for me. I'd definitely purchase another kuerig.

KS810-P, Imaging Keyboard,Scans variety of paper documents and 2"x3" smooth surface plastic cards up to 1mm thickness such as driver licenses, health insurance and ID cards.


..

34458735 Bought this for my wife, who has always complained about scanning documents. The printer is about 3 feet from the computer, which means she has to get up & go over to the scanner & then back to the computer.
She loves this keyboard/scanner, which means I love it.

..

34458735 First, one thing that I really liked about it was the keyboard. It has very good tactile feedback and the key depth is just right for me. As for scanning, it's a very handy tool, and being integrated into the keyboard means less surface space is being taken up. The overarching problem for me is KVM compatibility. If I didn't have it on a system with a KVM switch, I would have kept it. It may be more of a problem with the KVM than with the keyboard, but I don't have the time and the resources to try to figure it out. My KVM is essential for my needs, so the decision was made, regretfully, to return the Keyscan keyboard to the store.

..

34458735 It is a Saturday night...I could not figure out why my scanner was not working properly....went to the website had no answer (that I saw) to my problem emailled support...thought I would not hear until after monday and LO AND BEHOLD it was within an hour...OMG....Product support and a wonderful price....what more can anyone ask for!!!

..

34458735 This seems like a good idea, but it doesn't work that well. The keyboard is cheap. The scanner works ok once you get it setup, however the software is pretty old. They also make you keep a registration key for it, which is pretty lame given the software will only work with their keyboards. If you do get it, I had better luck with the software by copying the setup to the desktop and running it from there.

..

34458735 I had this keyboard for 3 years now. Stated using it on XP, moved up to win 7. Several weeks ago got a new Win 8 Computer. downloaded the latest version from their website, and it installed fine. I scan all my business bills and receipts directly to email our accountant.

..

34458735 After reading reviews and the warnings on the box I was careful to follow the directions to the T. I was able to do a basic scan and was initially impressed eith the speed and quality. None of the other functions were working and the next day I could not get it to scan. I called tech support. I was informed they do not have inhouse tech support so someone would have to call me back. Two days later a very helpful lady called me back and guided me through setting the correct options. I also found that if my computer went to sleep I had to unplug the keyboard for 30 seconds and then plug it back in. Sometimes that would work but most of the time it would scan half the sheet and then freeze. I would then reboot the computer and start all over again. Thank You BEST BUY for taking back my return with no hassle.

..

34458735 I worked temporarily for a boat dealership and they had this. It was amazing. The coolest thing ever. If you are a business owner and don't have it get it. It makes everything easier. My one downfall I had with it is that it's most likely more geared for desktops than laptops because it doesn't have any volume control buttons or other buttons like that. Totally going on my Christmas list for at home use.

..

34458735 I love this product. It is great. It is so compact, no heavy bulky printer. I love that it takes the large photos, most small scanners will only go up to 4X6. Convenient, space saving and not the cost of a printer with a scanner.

..

34458735 My experience started with the driver not loading properly. Then if you look at the readme file it tells you how to fix their poorly written driver...which comes way after you are already frustrated. Then the actual scanner feeds improperly or not at all. I was looking forward to using this product, but it's unreliability made it impossible to roll out to the rest of my company. I went with the NEAT scanner, which is more expensive, but soooo much better!

..

34458735 My desk stayed cluttered all the time with papers and all my husbands receipts that he has to keep track of. With this, I just run them through the scanner and save the docs in a matter of seconds. I don't have to shut down other programs I'm working on while doing it either. It's convenient, easy to use, and doesn't take up extra space. It handles tiny receipts or regular size, multi-page documents. I love it. My desk stays clean now!

Returned that product, ordered this Kingston module online from Best Buy, and after installing it I've had absolutely no problems.

..

34458735 Love,love, love this blender. After researching ALL the different blenders I finally decided on the Kitchen Aid and I have not regretted it. Purchased a blender to mainly make smoothies and this blender does a great job handling veggies and even frozen fruit. Chops giant clumps of ice in seconds. Drinks are awesome! Was a bonus that I could order the color I wanted and got it on sale. I also took advantage of an extra bonus summer percentage off the price. From start to finish my shopping experience was a pleasure. When I picked up my blender it was carried to my car by a polite sales associate. Really nice since I have to walk with a cane. I will definitely shop Best Buy again!

..

34458735 I had smaller KitchenAid countertop appliances. I gave those to my son and upgraded to the larger ones. Love the blender, but be careful when you wash it because the blade and pitcher are all one piece.

..

34458735 Works great, arrived on time and powers through everything. Will turn ice cubes into snow. This will be the last blender you buy.

..

34458735 I use this to make smoothies out of frozen fruit and it works great. The motor on this is very powerful and I have had no problems at all with this blender. Highly recommended.

Krups KM6 Precision 12-Cup Coffee Maker - Black - 1100 W - 12 Cup(s) - Black, Stainless Steel


..

34458735 I should have returned the coffee maker after the first week; the top, where you open to put the coffee and water stopped opening when you pushed the button on the top-right side. I fixed that problem by using a knife to pry it open. The coffee, when making 4-cups, is just awful, you have to use three scoops of coffee instead of 2 per 6 oz's. When making a 7 to 12 pot of coffee, I am always finding grinds in my coffee. It's nice that mine came with the gold mesh filter, however the stuff that gets through the filter tastes awful. Wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy. However, Krups does make some better coffee maker's for just about twice the price. I'm surprised that they still make this model.

It's the product of a collaboration between one of the most renowned design firms in the world and LaCie. The P'9230 lets you transfer files faster than ever with USB 3.0 performance, and has the capacity to hold all of your files. It also features a striking LED that both indicates power and lends sophisticated elegance.


..

34458735 It was what I needed for backup for home having multiple computers there.

..

34458735 I was expecting decent speeds with this drive over USB 3.0, but not as high as I am seeing.
Writing from my SSD in my Lenovo Thinkpad Helix to this drive I am seeing 195 MB/s. I moved 100GB of data in less than 9 minutes.
For a hard drive, that is fantastic. I am seeing comparable speeds on Samsung 840 SSDs(connected via USB 3.0). I'm so happy with the speed of this 3TB drive, I may buy a second one.
On a side note... Don't format the drive yourself! Use the LaCie included software and don't delete it off the drive once formatted. I deleted the software and my write speeds dropped to 110 MB/s. Once I added it back, they returned to 195 MB/s.

..

34458735 Bought this to replace a LaCie that died on me after five years. My MacBook Pro recognizes it quickly and Lightroom finds it just as quickly. Its well built and seems very solid, I would highly recommend this drive.

..

34458735 I like the Lacie products mainly because they keep the power supply the same with all their units. I also like the easy way to store and label. I do not like the idea that best buy does not carry them continuously.

..

34458735 After having two Western Digital hard drives fail within 2 years of purchase and being basically brand new since I only backed up my data every 6 months, I was disgusted. A techie pointed me in the direction of the LaCie as a product with better components. I lost 16 years of backup data with Western Digital's two "My Book." Happy with the LaCie.

..

34458735 If its your first time backing up its kind of hard still dont understand it

..

34458735 This was the easier product to install and get running that i have seen. The Porsche backup is silent and the blue light lets me know it is working!

..

34458735 I store a lot of photos and I'm beginning to work on video as well, so this hard drive is excellent for my usage.

..

34458735 love it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

..

34458735 Overall I think this is a great external hard drive. Nice solid case, on/off switch (many do not have this). The lack of USB 3.0 means it takes more time to transfer files, but that is not an issue for me since I mainly am using it for archiving.

..

..

34458735 I am sure most of you have played a game in the Lego series before. This plays exactly like you would expect. You explore and progress through the game using different characters from the series. I'm not going to bore you by going into details other than to say the game is fairly long and all the characters are here.
The only real bad thing I can say is that the graphics do look fuzzy. They are not as clear as I would expect on the Vita's beautiful screen. Other than that the game is good and a good buy at $20 or under.

..

34458735 I couldn't stand playing this game on the Playstation Vita. The graphics are terrible and the way that they took the game from the PS3 to this was terrible. I def. think they could have done a better job on making this game look and feel more like the PS3 version.

..

34458735 One word
HORRIBLE
Another word
LAZY
There is only one reason to spend your money on this game and that is if you only care about trophies. This was a complete waste of money and a complete lack of effort on Travelers Tales behalf. All it is is a port of the PSP version of the game. Looks and plays awful on what is such a powerful system in the Vita.
Matter of fact, go play Lego Batman for the PSP and then play this. You will easily see what I mean.
They should have paid me to play this game. What I wouldn't give for a refund.

..

34458735 Excellent tablet. You will not find a better tablet in the world. Although I have to disagree with the price. Android and IOS rule the world these days and Windows 8 is in 3rd place so the price needs to be a tad lower. The tablet does run full version of Windows 8 not that RT junk but still the app store is limited nothing remotely exciting in there. If one does shop around you can find this tablet cheaper. Its like a MS Surface Mini. Runs good. No complaints. Have to comment on the smaller screen though. WIth a mouse you can pretty much nail the buttons in desktop mode, but with fingers in desktop mode, you will alot of times miss the button and end up clicking something else. I guess thats expected with an 8 inch screen.

..

34458735 Positives:
- PC in your pocket
- no need for "apps", you can have full windows applications
- no apps limitation
Think of it, the tablet is only trying to emulate the PC, I like the Android platform but this gives me much more options...
Negatives:
- no hdmi
- sound is not loud enough
- sound is not helped by the design flaw of the speaker placement and the fact that the actual Lenovo cover will cover the speaker
Overall, I waited and got it for $280 which is truly a great buy for a 64gb tablet with a powerful processor.

..

34458735 This was an impulse buy while in the store. I liked the idea of an 8 inch tablet with Windows 8. Once I got home and read the reviews online, I realized that more than 50% of the people that bought it hated it. It froze up immediately. I couldn't get it to work at all. I took it back and got my money back.

..

34458735 I was looking for a small tablet primarily for consuming web and media content. I use Windows 8.1 at home and work. I wanted something that would synch easily with Windows and on which I could do Microsoft Office work when necessary without lugging my whole computer. I looked at this and the Dell Venue as options. I went with the Lenovo because of positive experience with Lenovo computers.
I really love this device for browsing the web, reading ebooks, and watching videos. It is light and comfortable in the hand. The build quality seems solid. The screen is excellent for most applications. The only real problem I have had so far is that it is hard to read in sunlight.
For real work, it is a different story. Office runs fine and looks good. But it, and all desktop programs, are very small on this screen and hard to navigate by finger. The on screen keyboard is adequate for most tasks but actually composing a document or long email is frustrating.
I made two purchases that improved my experience. First, for work, I bought a Microsoft Bluetooth wedge mobile keyboard. It has Windows keys, paired easily and works great with the tablet. I also bought a cheap capacitive stylus, which helps a bit but is inconvenient to store. One note on that point, I returned the Lenovo-designed cover/stylus combo. The cover was slightly flimsy and the stylus simply did not work most of the time.
If Office or other desktop apps are not important to you, think hard about a Windows RT device. Having used this Miix for a few weeks I have renewed respect for RT. When the Nokia 8" RT or Surface Mini come out, they might be the killer devices. But, if like me, you want the security of being able to do work in a pinch, this is a great option.
Last thing: there is no 4G option (at least as far as I know). While I am often in a wifi spot, 4G would make this awesome.

..

34458735 Have owned this machine for little over a month now. Is perfect. Form factor is light and small -- better form factor than Samsung Note 8 tablet that I came from. Machine has full version of Windows and MS Office. Very responsive. Screen is beautiful and higher resolution quality than competitor products. Looked at Dell competitor, but it was clunkier and had a worse screen quality. One thing to do when you buy, is to follow the step outlined at this link. That stops the occasional freezes that happen out of the box. Fixes it perfectly and is easy to do.

34458735 As a college student and a tech junkie/ nerd, I was really skeptical of this tablet given that it uses an atom processor and runs full windows. That said,the new quad core generation is not only zippy, but impressive! In fact, I'm typing this review on it. Office pre installed, great battery life, great screen (its oh so crisp even despite not being 1080, pixel hounds worry not), you can even reasonably game on it. Get the 64 gb version and you get roughly 40 free. This is a fair amount, but my ideal little guy tablet would have 128, still ill just add a micro sd. The best bang for your buck and the better choice in the growing Windows 8, 8 inch tablets.

34458735 Charged it fully and turned on. Setup password and started to setup internet when the screen scrambled. Was able to turn off, but it would last about 5 minutes each time I turned it on before the screen would go black or scrambled. I guess they spent all their money putting Windows on it, they couldn't make unit last. Returning to Bestbuy after 1 day.

..

34458735 I had this tablet for two weeks when it quit booting up. A black screen of death is all that's left of this brick. It's going back to Best Buy.
Before it died, the touchscreen was slow to respond to touches and required several attempts before the tablet would respond to commands.
The charging cord does not go into the connection for the USB charger very easily and once it does the connection is loose and doesn't fit well.
Overall quality is extremely poor. Avoid this poor quality product. It was a cheap tablet and you get what you pay for.

34458735 I needed a new pair of earbuds to replace the ones that came with my Galaxy S. At first I wasn't getting a great fit or good sound, but once I changed to the smaller sized ear cushions I was able to alleviate those problems. The biggest change I've noticed is that I can listen to music at a lower volume. Extremely low volume! And it still blocks out a lot of outside noise. I can still hear people talking around me but I can't make out what they are saying. This really lets you get in the zone when listening to music. Additionally the microphone is superior to the one that I needed to replace. Friends now say that they can hear my voice better and don't notice the background noise when we talk on the phone.

34458735 I needed a new pair of earbuds to replace the ones that came with my Galaxy S. At first I wasn't getting a great fit or good sound, but once I changed to the smaller sized ear cushions I was able to alleviate those problems. The biggest change I've noticed is that I can listen to music at a lower volume. Extremely low volume! And it still blocks out a lot of outside noise. I can still hear people talking around me but I can't make out what they are saying. This really lets you get in the zone when listening to music. Additionally the microphone is superior to the one that I needed to replace. Friends now say that they can hear my voice better and don't notice the background noise when we talk on the phone. I just wish I could get quality headphones for under 20 bucks.

Experience rich, detailed audio with these Audiofly AF56 AF561-0-02 earbud headphones that feature 13mm dynamic drivers for a powerful bass boost. Four sets of silicone ear tips ensure optimal noise isolation and comfortable use.


..

34458735 Overall I'm pretty happy with these headphones. The sound is what I would expect for the value, it has the extra earbud sizes which is nice. My main gripes are 1) it says they are tangle free which is a nearly impossible claim (keeping them in the tin does help) and 2) the cloth cord was a feature I was really looking forward to but after using these for about a month the cord is getting a little fuzzy already. I did use them a couple times for phone calls and they were reported to be pretty clear by people on the other end which is a plus.

You're a very specific type of traveler. Your business and pleasure travel routinely takes you to Western Europe. You're looking for a 5-language translator that can do all the talking for you in every kind of situation. You want a large vocabulary and an equally large database of phrases in a limited number of languages. If this is you, then you want to let the Lingo Euro 5Talk translator do the speaking for you!


..

34458735 I recieved this as a Christmas Gift and Have been nothing but happy with it. It is very easy to use, and the keys are as easy to use as a moblie phone. It is full of useful phrases. You will be amazed of how much they have already thought of to program into the translator.. This will help out in so many ways in my life ...Work, Travel, Interacting with people daily. It's Endless..
I would like the voice to be clearer. but You can still understand what it's saying with little to no problems.

..

34458735 I hate it, the vocabulary is VERY limited and it has no articles needed for languages like French where each noun has a gender. It is virtually useless!! Don't get it unless you are going to the 5 countries and you need to know how to say "hi" "yes" or "no"

Protect your Apple iPad 2, iPad 3rd Generation or iPad with Retina with this Logitech 939-000490 folio sleeve that guards the front and back of your device against damage and doubles as a multiview flip stand for hands-free use in 4 positions.


..

34458735 I bought this on clearance through Best Buy (not Marketplace) online as a new item. I received the item, put my iPad in it, and immediately wanted to return it. Even though the item was new, the inside cover was yellowing around the edges of the fabric. Also, the sleep wake function when opening and closing the cover was very unreliable compared to a smart cover. I would recommend going with a different cover/case as I was unimpressed with this one.

..

34458735 works very well to cover the IPAD, and is very durable

..

34458735 I love the color of the case and I also love the fact that it's sturdy and fits the I-pad well.

..

34458735 Very nice and protective cover. If I need another one, I'll buy again.

..

34458735 My husband gave me this as a gift. It fits nicely and it protects the iPad well, I can access all buttons easily and charge it with no problem but it is very heavy and get really tired just holding the iPad. The color is violent but apparently was only one available. The material grabs dirt easily. In all just an OK cover. Still a bit expensive considering.

..

34458735 works great for an adult ipad and i like that it covers the screen

..

34458735 Works great, very lightweight. Handles everyday wear and tear.

..

34458735 I simply love the way it fit on my iPad. It is not bulky like others I have had on it.

..

34458735 I had high hopes for this case, but it failed miserably. First off, the inside cover was dirty around the edges. Then, the rubber ring that held the iPad in had a weird green tint and it lifted up the screen protector, even once I got the iPad in. If it moved around slightly, the edge messed with the screen protector. Also, since there's no latch on the case to hold it closed securely and the cover is kind of loose, it was constantly turned the iPad on and off while it was closed. Took it back.

..

34458735 Good price, light weight, stays in place and propped up

..

This handheld GPS is designed for use with Geocaching and is preloaded with popular geocaches from around the world. The 2.2" sunlight-readable color screen allows for easy viewing while you're outdoors.


..

34458735 This was sold at a great discount. Its baseline low MSRP shows up in the accuracy vs even older devices when coming up to a cache. It is also slow to start vs my Garmin Dakota 20 considering it is an application running on top of a very old, tired Windows CE operating system.

..

34458735 Navigating the GC menu was not intuitive. When at a geocache location signal was erratic. Definitively a study in frustration in trying to get this device to do what it was designed to do.

..

34458735 I really liked the interface for this GPS device and how many caches it would hold. There's a lot to like about it. But it's missing one thing that I find VERY important, a digital compass. What does that mean you might ask?
If you're standing still and looking at the screen to figure out which direction to go, it jumps all over the place. Go left, no right, no forward, no left, no backwards. To solve this issue, they suggest you walk at 2-3 miles per hour so it can determine based off the satellites which way you're going and which way the device is facing. Great idea for a geocaching device. So, I'm walking through the woods in the middle of nowhere and instead of watching where I'm walking, I'm watching the screen of my GPS? Doesn't it make more sense to stop walking and look at the device? But if you do that, it gets confused and doesn't know which way to point. Quite frustrating.
I had this and a Garmin Dakota 20 at the same time and compared the two. The Dakota 20 took a while to configure the way I wanted it configured but once I got it set up right, it does the job. I still like the interface of the Magellan better, but if it fall short on pointing in the right direction, it doesn't matter how good the interface is. I returned it and kept the Garmin since with it, I can stand still, look at the screen, and it will point me in the right direction.

..

34458735 Great for geocaching, good battery life. It took awhile to get use to where the different items were on the menu but after learning curve it is easier.

..

34458735 After trying to GC with my Droid... I quickly realized I needed a better solution that would give me more than a couple of hours! This thing is fantastic and easy enough that my kids can use it. I would recommend you download VantagePoint software which gives you the ability to sync it up with your computer... it allows you to import GCs for seamless paperless GC fun! I got it on a price match... and for $100 it was the best thing yet for GC!!!

..

34458735 I was very excited to make this purchase thinking it would make my meager geocaching skills much easier to manage. In fact the nearest preloaded cache was well over 200 miles away. Each and every cache in my nearby vicinity had to be preloaded. They advertise 1000s of preloaded caches, but glossed over the fact that those were so spread out over the world it made it them completely useless for me. The interface is supposed to be easy, but it is not and comes with no real instructions...but you can look them up pretty easily. But it is not real intuitive, and you can not search for random caches you want to search for on the spur of the moment. The software to download cache information (also an online download) doesn't work very well and I have had several problems with it even seeing the unit when it is plugged in. Over all I list this review as average. The unit does track to programed GPS coordinates, I just wanted it to be much easier. I mean that is why I bought it seeing I already have another handheld GPS that worked, I was looking for more convenience.

..

34458735 After reading reviews of this unit at geocaching.com, I decided to get it.
What a piece of junk. Unit would not get past half of the Magellan screen on power up and would not turn off. Tried pulling out batteries and start over. No joy. I called Magellan and they told me to do what I had already tried, they told me the unit was already corrupted, and said they would sent me a replacement, in 5 to 8 days. No thank you! I took it back and got a refund.

..

34458735 Works great for Geocaching. Easy to load from the websites. easy to use.

..

34458735 Easy to use, and read. Just what you need for Geocaching

..

34458735 I was very disappointed in the preloaded "nearest" geocaches. I live in LA and the unit showed the nearest geocache in San Diego.
Called Magellan and they told me that ONLY the top 1000 in the world are loaded. I consider this feature totally useless and I think the unit would be better off without it all together.

Enjoy viewing your favorite movies with this Magnavox 22MD311B LCD HDTV that features a built-in DVD player to support your entertainment collection. The 720p resolution and Clear Pix Engine Plus deliver crisp, vibrant images.


..

34458735 This TV was easy to set up. I was even able to connect the base by myself even though the instructions said it was a two-person job. The initial channel setup was simple. I find the picture and sound to be adequate for a low-priced 780p TV, and more importantly, it is not an LED set, so the picture image is good from the side and from above. My wife set it up on the bottom shelf of a table and watches from above the screen. The TV is not used extensively, so I can't comment on the longevity. So far it has performed well.

..

34458735 perfect size for an employee lunchroom, where wall space is at a minimum. Picture quality was also very good. Sound quality was excellent.

..

34458735 Tv worked for 2 min. Piece of junk!!!! Since Bestbuy did their job I have dealt with Magnavox directly. What a joke. Never again!!! They were fast to pick up the first one. Now trying to get the replacement is a waste of time. Never again will I buy a Magnavox.

..

34458735 We bought this tv/DVD player to replace the old tv/DVD/VCR in our guest room and we have been very happy with. It gets a good picture. Was easy for e to hook up & program the directv remote to operate both the tv & directv box which wouldn't work our old tv. Takes up a lot less room then our old one because its a flat screen.

..

34458735 My mom seems to like it, so that makes it a good product in my eyes.

..

34458735 Had an old Analog TV with an A/D converter that found it hard to lock onto weak signal. This TV locks on better.

..

34458735 Good picture of and handy DVD player built in.

..

34458735 I got it as a gift for my sister and she and I are very satisfied with it overall!

..

34458735 This purchase was priced right, and delivered very quickly.

..

34458735 Overall excellent choice. Never been disappointed with Magnavox . The top load DVD player is key- unit placed in bookcase/shelving and you can't access side insert DVD on other manufactures models without pulling half the tv off the shelf. I would have to agree the sound quality could be better, of course it could be my hearing is just getting worse. Some reviews recommended sound bar.

Featuring Intel HD graphics with 128MB of dedicated video memory, this Acer C720-2420 Chromebook delivers strikingly realistic visuals. The Intel Celeron processor delivers reliability for everyday mobile computing.


..

34458735 It is very good computer for beginner and most every day uses. I bought for my sister's birthday present but somebody gave her Mac computer so i kept for myself and used and it is very useful and very easy to use and easy carry around everywhere because it is very light. Iam very happy that i am bought this.

..

34458735 Picked this model up based on user reviews instead of buying a laptop. I have to say I am pleasantly surprised at how well the unit is constructed and how well it operates. It boots up in seconds flat, the build quality is solid, and I have no complaints about the performance. The setup was extremely minimal, and it worked right out of the box. There are plenty of online and offline apps to choose from. I use mine mainly for web-based research and writing, and so far it does everything I need it to do. It won't replace my desktop for gaming, but I didn't expect it to. This would be great for students also. The amount of storage isn't huge, but you can slap in an SD card or use an external HD for extra space. The keyboard doesn't feel cramped to me, and the keypad and touchscreen are both responsive. The only complaints I would have about it would be that the sound quality isn't all that great and it only came in the color white. For the money I paid though, these complaints are insignificant and I would highly recommend this to anyone considering buying one. I was extremely skeptical at first and waffled for months before buying it, but now I'm glad I did!

..

34458735 I would recommend this product to anyone. Easy to use for a beginner or advanced user

..

34458735 Extremely fast chromebook, battery lasts is more than I expected. Excellent value for the money paid.

..

34458735 I was doing alot of research online and reading a bunch of reviews on all the available chromebooks and found that the Acer was the biggest bank for the buck.I've had mine for over a month and I love this thing.Super fast,easy to setup and digging all that google has to offer without all the windows errors and expensive software.Quality built and it's just a goodlooking laptop.Touch screen is also a big plus.

..

34458735 I purchased the Acer C720P because I felt it would suit my purpose, I was happy with it until the wi-fi went out. The wi-fi has gone out twice within a month and a half... the second time I called in to technical support for help. I had to call in twice and both times had a hard time understanding the phone reps. I was asked to reset the Chromebook back to factory settings but that did not resolve the issue. The second time I called I was told I would need to send it in at my expense. My only issue at this point is, if I have only had it for a month and half and there are issues with it, should that not be the responsibility of the manufacturer? Several years ago I purchased a Toshiba laptop and had issues, Toshiba incurred all expenses to repair and get it back to me. Really, that is my only problem.....

..

34458735 My 11 year old son loves this chromebook.Its really user friendy and it has parental features which lets me control what my son does on the chromebook.
I would reccomend this to family and friends.................................
Thank you.....................................
This is the great computer and not to expensive.

..

34458735 I got this laptop knowing that it came with minimal programming but manly because it was cheap and offered touch screen. I love it. Powering up and down is instant (huge plus, since I have no patience), programs are not bogging me down and I can do everything I normally do (email, browse, shop, minimal gaming) it's great. I even have my twin 2 year olds and 4 year old playing on it. The touch screen is awesome for that. They love being able to go on the computer. They even get watch movies. All and all I am very pleased with this product and I'd buy it again.

..

34458735 Mostly a convenience product, not ideal if you don't want to spend to much time hooking up to other devices to make it of more use.
Also you get used to the well under average size.

..

34458735 I recommend this unit for anyone that needs a bit more than a tablet and a bit less than a full computer. Great to surf the net, access social media, email, etc. Almost immediate op system start, just a few seconds. Great battery life, good screen resolution and one can use the keyboard or touchscreen.

Protect your Apple iPad 2 with this case that features a smooth anodized aluminum finish with a hard plastic trim to keep your iPad safe from dings and scratches.


..

34458735 I love this case. It is very stylish and protects well. Glad I purchased it.

..

34458735 I will just stop short of calling this fraudulent advertising. The product is not as displayed in the pictures.
The only thing that comes with this product is a cheap plastic shell that attaches to the back of the ipad and serves no other purpose than maybe serving as a different colored cover for just the back of the ipad.
The front cover and extra flap shown is not sold with the product. For $40+ it is over priced.
If I had known that the front cover and flap shown in the picture did not come with it, I would not have bought it. Unfortunately, I threw away the packaging after I bought it, only to open up the box and find just the single plastic. Otherwise I would have returned it immediately. I feel cheated and like I wasted my money. For less than $10 I could find a plastic cover for the back of my ipad.

The PowerCenter MDP 650 6-Outlet Surge Suppressor has a special GreenPower Outlet Management system that works automatically to eliminate energy waste in connected PC systems. Users simply plug their computer into the GreenPower Control outlet, then plug their additional connected PC peripherals (printer, monitor, scanner, loudspeakers, etc.) into the specially marked Monster GreenPower Controlled outlets. When the computer is turned off or goes to sleep, the other GreenPower outlets automatically switch off, eliminating the energy wasted by peripheral components when they're not in use. When the computer turns back on, the GreenPower outlets automatically power the peripherals up again.


..

34458735 When i was randomly browsing BestBuy.com i happened to stumble upon this monster power strip from 69.99 down to 24.99. Being that Monster is a leading brand for audio/video equipment and power i decided to pick it up and i am quite happy with it. Just make sure that you use it for desktop computers and flat screens in small bedrooms. It doesn't actually help or make a difference if you use it on an energy efficient device such as a laptop computer.

Motorola 89432N Vehicle Mount Holder - Horizontal, Vertical - 1 Each


..

34458735 I love the set-up, but I wish there were more optional apps to put on Car Home. I also wish my favorites from my phone translated to the Favorites on the Calling app on the home screen.

..

34458735 If you have a Droid X and do not have this car dock, you better get one. The Droid X navigation will blow your mind and you need to have this on your dash to allow proper use while on a trip, short or far....it is right there in your face...not too much or too little. Comes with the radio AUX cable and car charger, easily clips the phone in and don't rattle around. Only problem is having to take the phone out of the case I use, but not a big deal. Charges decently from what I can tell and fully allows you to utilize Google Maps, as well as music to play through your stereo (provided you have an AUX port in your vehicle). Buy it you won't be disappointed. Not to mention, shipping was uber fast

..

34458735 Excellent dock setup that allows for view of phone for GPS or music/video while keeping charged. Comes with all the accessories you need including a car charger and RCA connection to the radio.

..

34458735 This is especially useful when we need to deal with the short battery life of every smart phone on the market. I can charge my phone when driving to/from work. You also put the very nice built-in GPS from google maps into your daily commute. The phone is switched to car-dock mode as soon as you dock it. The menu can be customized to your needs. Yes, you can also use it as speaker phone but I find that the volume is not loud enough when driving with reasonable wind noise. If motorola can add a amplified speaker phone to the unit, I think that would complete the whole package. Still a recommended buy!

..

34458735 I love this car dock setup for my Droid X. It works well with my phone in GPS mode and I can easily make hands free calls from it while mounted. Charges your phone also. It goes into a car mode as soon as you put it in the dock and it can be customized to fit your needs. I love it and very happy I bought it.

..

34458735 This mount completes the GPS system using Google Maps. It includes a charger worth about $15, a stereo aux cable long enough to reach your stereo system, not to mention the mount... Best Buy online price tag of $34.99 is an awesome price and turns your phone into the best GPS system for free! Google maps always downloads latest maps, and with an extended press of the search button on your phone you can find any point of interest by just uttering it's name after stating, "navigate to"!

..

34458735 Works in both landscape AND portrait. Easy to use and set up. Very sturdy hold yet easy to dock and remove phone.

..

34458735 This is a great car mount. It has a strong suction attachment, its easy to put together, allows for charging, and automatically puts the phone into car mode. Highly recommend this.

..

34458735 Comes in handy if you want to use the GPS on your phone and not have to buy a seperate device. Mounts easy enough on the windshield and you can plug a power cable into it. But if the $59.99 price tag is true, its ridiculous.

..

34793627 Night vision is good. Audio works fine. Everything works. I recommend this camcorder. I love it. Tripod works perfect. The light works pretty good. Night vision does change into a few colors. But the night vision is still good. I recommend getting a ir light for the camcorder so the range in the night vision would go further in range. Overall it's a good camcorder.

34793627 I am a real person, and this is not a hired review. I just got my Bell & Howell DNV16HDZ (Black) Rogue IR Night Vision Camera today and immediately started putting it to use. I will be using this camera for filming as I drive, and for recreational paranormal investigations.
After purchasing, I happened upon a few negative reviews towards this camera stating that the focus never stopped auto focusing... Really made me nervous about my decision. These claims are somewhat true, but not nearly as bad as people said it was. For me, it only occurs when moving the camera rapidly or switching from a close focus to a far focus. Only lasts a second. If it bothers you that much, lock the autofocus when the camera is in focus and you're good to go.
The night vision is impeccable for this price and I'm astonished. In my house today, I was able to see about 15-20 feet in front of me with the night vision.
I assume anyone that buys a $239.00 video camera is not very serious about what they're doing, if so, you will love this camera. If you are expecting top of the line, don't be vapid and buy a $239.00 video camera. I mean seriously... It just takes some common sense. If you consider yourself a professional, don't cheap out on a camera and then go and bash it.
Also, if you need to use an external microphone, it doesn't have a specific mic input but a specific USB microphone will work just fine.
The order came exactly when they said it would, and came with everything advertised. Carrying Case, Cleaning/Detailing Kit, Enough Screen Protectors to mess up 19 times and still have one, 2 Batteries, 59" Tripod, 32GB SD Card, and everything listed in 'in the box.'
Overall, I am thoroughly satisfied with my purchase and wanted to encourage anyone, who is skeptical about this camera, not to fret. If you're not someone who needs the best, and wants a camera just for personal use, this camera will exceed your expectations. I plan on uploading a video to youtube as well.

34793627 I am a real person, and this is not a hired review. I just got my Bell & Howell DNV16HDZ (Black) Rogue IR Night Vision Camera today and immediately started putting it to use. I will be using this camera for filming as I drive, and for recreational paranormal investigations.
After purchasing, I happened upon a few negative reviews towards this camera stating that the focus never stopped auto focusing... Really made me nervous about my decision. These claims are somewhat true, but not nearly as bad as people said it was. For me, it only occurs when moving the camera rapidly or switching from a close focus to a far focus. Only lasts a second. If it bothers you that much, lock the autofocus when the camera is in focus and you're good to go.
The night vision is impeccable for this price and I'm astonished. In my house today, I was able to see about 15-20 feet in front of me with the night vision.
I assume anyone that buys a $239.00 video camera is not very serious about what they're doing, if so, you will love this camera. If you are expecting top of the line, don't be vapid and buy a $239.00 video camera. I mean seriously... It just takes some common sense. If you consider yourself a professional, don't cheap out on a camera and then go and bash it.
Also, if you need to use an external microphone, it doesn't have a specific mic input but a specific USB microphone will work just fine.
The order came exactly when they said it would, and came with everything advertised. Carrying Case, Cleaning/Detailing Kit, Enough Screen Protectors to mess up 19 times and still have one, 2 Batteries, 59" Tripod, 32GB SD Card, and everything listed in 'in the box.'
Overall, I am thoroughly satisfied with my purchase and wanted to encourage anyone, who is skeptical about this camera, not to fret. If you're not someone who needs the best, and wants a camera just for personal use, this camera will exceed your expectations. I plan on uploading a video to youtube as well.

Capture clear photos and record smooth videos using a compatible camera or camcorder with this Bower Steady Lift Series VTSL7200 tripod, which features rubber-tipped legs with 3 individual leg locks to ensure stability on a variety of surface types.


..

34793627 Good overall product, sturdy, flexible for the price.

..

34793627 I bought this as a backup for my regular tripod and don't plan to use it too often.

..

34793627 I needed every inch this tripod could give me and it delivered. I needed something tall enough so that people walking in front of the camcorder would not block the shot. It was easy to expand and place the camcorder on it. It comes with its own carrying case and is easy to transport. It folds to a nice compact size.

Photographers looking for an easy-to-use camera that will help them create their next masterpiece need look no further than the Canon EOS Rebel T3i. The next in a long line of phenomenal compact DSLRs, the EOS Rebel T3i continues the Rebel tradition of easy operation, compact design and no-compromise performance. Featuring Canons DIGIC 4 Image Processor and an 18.0 Megapixel CMOS Image Sensor - plus cutting-edge technologies like Full HD video recording, Live View shooting, Wireless flash photography and even a Vari-angle 3.0-inch LCD monitor - the EOS Rebel T3i offers the best of EOS photography in a compact package. This outfit includes the Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS II standard zoom lens, which is designed with Canons Optical Image Stabilizer technology while retaining the compactness and lightness of previous models. Its stabilization allows sharp hand-held shots at shutter speeds up to four stops slower than otherwise possible. It consists of 11 elements in 9 groups and uses an Aspherical lens element to correct aberration for excellent image quality throughout the zoom range and a circular aperture for exquisite rendering of out-of-focus backgrounds.


..

34793627 This set up is everything you need to get started doing professional photography/videography right out of the box.
The T3i is an excellent camera, and the two lenses it comes with are pretty nice. The wide angle and telephoto lens adapters are nice, but you do get a vignette at certain zoom lengths because of the crop sensor in the T3i. The wide angle adapter also has a macro adapter that screws off of it, which is pretty cool.
The SD card reader was different than the one shown, and so was the SD card holder, but I like the ones that came with it better.
The tripod is alright, but it's a little stiff, which kinda sucks for video if you need fluid motion, but fine for locked-down shots.
The cleaning kit is great, and it came with LCD screen protectors (enough that you won't ever need to worry about buying more). And the carrying case holds everything shown, minus the tripod.
Over-all I'm very satisfied with this purchase, and it even arrived a day earlier than expected! Next is to look into audio/lighting equipment.

The Canon EOS Rebel SL1 is small in size but enormous in performance. With a newly-designed 18.0 Megapixel CMOS (APS-C) sensor and speedy DIGIC 5 Image Processor, it delivers images of extraordinary quality -- ideal for those stepping up from a smartphone or compact camera. An impressive ISO range of 100-12800 (expandable to H: 25600) for stills and 100-6400 (expandable to H: 12800) for video plus up to 4.0 fps continuous shooting make this camera the go-to for any photo opportunity, even in dim lighting or when capturing fast action subjects.   Included is the Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM lens which features one high-precision aspheric lens to reduce chromatic aberration and a 7-blade circular aperture to ensure beautiful, soft backgrounds. The Optical Image Stabilizer system offers the equivalent of four stops of compensation. This lens perfectly complements the Movie Servo AF feature found on select EOS Cameras with a compact six-group zoom system and a new stepping motor and focus mechanism to deliver smooth and quiet continuous AF during movie shooting.   Also Included is the Canon EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III Zoom Lens. This compact and lightweight 4x telephoto zoom lens is ideal for shooting sports, portraits, and wildlife. The front part of the zoom ring now sports a silver ring for a luxury touch.  This Camera kit has everything you need to take grate pictures.


..

34793627 I really wanted this camera and did a LOT of research in stores and on the Internet, and this was the best deal out there. Oh, I could find other sites selling the basic camera body and 18-55mm lens cheaper, but they had some terrible reviews. Ordered this, received it 7 days later (no state tax charged!). The product description doesn't list everything that's included in the package, but the picture does it justice. The only complaint I have (and it's quite minor) is that the extra battery charger that they sent doesn't fit the Cannon batteries. Big deal? Not really, The camera comes with a charger, and with 2 batteries, one's in the camera and the other is in the legit charger. If this is your first DSLR and you want an excellent setup out of the box, you can't beat this deal.

This digital SLR camera backpack features an adjustable divider system to help keep your accessories organized and side and front pockets for additional storage. A convenient weather hood fits over the bag for protection from the elements.


..

34793627 A perfect bag for your DSLR camera and gadgets. If you are a tech savvy person, this one is for your.
Additionally, I got a good deal on bestbuy.

..

34793627 Convenience of having all my equipment when traveling

..

34793627 I really like this bag. It is easily adjustable to fit the DSLR camera and accessories that I want to carry. I haven't used it for long yet so I can't comment on long term durability but the bag appears to be soundly constructed.

..

34793627 comportable is light for my camera and excellent Divicion very good for transporting equipment.

..

34793627 Lots of space for the equipment, also space for a laptop or ipad and a rain bag in case is raining(atached to the back pack).

..

34793627 Just starting off with a couple of lens and small accessories, but there's plenty of room for future purchases! Wish it held a larger tripod more securely. I can fit mine, but it's a bit awkward.

..

34793627 Very nice camera case and the sale price makes it an excellent value. I really like the laptop sleve. I like to take a laptop on shoots to view pictures as I'm taking them. I can bring it in this backpack without having to carry a seperate laptop bag.

..

34793627 I like it, makes traveling with my gear essentials easier!

..

34793627 I saw this product 3 days ago on sale for less than $60 and decided to buy. Today, it has arrived to my doorstep. My first impression was delivery; it came so fast for free shipping. The product itself has great build quality and material. It has a laptop compartment perfect for my laptop. The DSLR compartment is great, there are plenty of adjustable dividers for you to change as photography desire. Then there is another compartment good to store things like: book, paperwork, laptop's charger, and mouse. On one of the sides, you can have a small tripod, while the other side you can store a water bottle. If the weather turns bad, there is a weather hood. It can cover the whole thing until where the straps start.

..

34793627 I purchased this as a gift for my husband who needed a camera case that made it easy to reach in and retrieve the camera or lens quickly. This case also has plenty of room for future additions of lens.

..

34793627 
Designed for use with most digital SLR cameras, this sling is ideal for the active photographer. A hammock system suspends the camera inside for impact protection and multiple pockets and straps help ensure organization of accessories.


..

34793627 I like the sling bag, but hard to access the camera as quickly as I thought I would be able to. Has very good support and compartments inside to keep the camera and len(s) safe and protected.

..

34793627 The bag works great for carrying my camera (a Canon 7D) but there isn't much room for more than that. The pocket for lenses is quite large, however, and I feel like they aren't secure at times when they're in the aforementioned pocket.
The product also struggles in allowing the carrying of anything besides a lens or two and the camera. The suspension system works great but all of the other pockets are tiny and allow for skinny objects (memory cards, lens caps, etc.) only.
If you just want to go out and take pictures, this is a great bag for quick and easy access. If you're looking to be able to pack a lunch or a computer, go in a different direction.

..

34793627 This case is perfect for an entry level DSLR and a spare lens with a few other accessories like spare SD cards, batteries, lens brush pen, etc. It sits a little funny on me simply because of my short torso but it's not bad enough for me to send it back. There's a gap between the bag and my back. I'm keeping it for hiking and horse-back riding here in the Rockies.

..

34793627 I love this case as it allows me to safetly carry my T3 lens down and has plenty of room to carry all accessories. It has 1 side compartment that can carry 2 additional lenses. I use it to carry my 55-250 lens as well as 2 battery chargers and 2 filter pouches. There is a small zippered pocket that allows me to carry additional batteries as well as my SD card organizer. Small zippered pocket on one of the sides that carries cleaning cloth, usb cable and remote trigger. Overall, great case that is not too big to get in the way and being a sling, it is very comfortable.

..

34793627 This is a nice bag and I decided to try it even though some of the reviews said it did not fit well on small women. (I'm 5'4") I tried it on and it just was not going to work. I returned it to the store with no trouble from Best Buy.
The bag strap wanted to fall off my shoulder because my shoulders were too narrow. Also I was looking for something smaller and less bulky than my current camera backpack. This bag was about the same size as my backpack but would not hold as much stuff.
If you are big enough I am sure this is a great bag but if you are small make sure you can try it on first before you buy.

..

34793627 Overall I love this bag. It is very comfortable with super easy access to SLR and accessories. I wore it for about 5hr hike and didn't get annoyed with it even once. It wears very comfortably and stays in place once properly fastened. I really like the tripod mounting feature where you can easily attach it to the front of the bag.
The only down side is that the side pocket fits only one 70-300mm lens. So as long as you operate with two lenses or less you will be fine and perfectly happy with it.

..

34793627 This sling is quite comfortable to wear and easy to adjust. Much nicer than carrying around a box shaped camera bag all day! I love that I can keep the bag on my back and swing it around to take my camera out instead of having to take the whole bag off. It has one nice big pockets that fits my external flash and extra 50 mm lens with a little extra room left in there. There are a few other nice small pockets for lens covers, camera cards, etc.
I like the sling part in the inside for the camera and it feels like it protects the camera better than if it was just sitting inside of a bag.
Only thing that I'm not a real huge fan of is that it doesn't set down very good if that makes sense- it topples over easily and has to be on its side all the time. Very minor though.

..

34793627 I had been using a small case logic bag for a few years, however when I got a new lens for my camera, I needed something better. I love to travel a lot and do adventurous activities so I wanted a bag that provided easy access to my camera, was comfortable, and also kept my camera safe in dicey situations. I climbed a volcano in Nicaragua with my last camera bag and was slightly uncomfortable for the 8 hours. This bag seems like the best buy for my needs, and it was. The bag securely holds the camera on your back. There's a pretty large extra pocket for another lens or 2 and much smaller pockets for other small accessories.The bag is extremely padded and can be easily swung around to grab your camera when you need to take that quick shot. The camera sits in a hammock like sling with a X shaped slit for the lens to fit. This part can be taken off if its not suitable for you, but should fit the size of all cameras - I know that was an issue with a couple of the bags I looked at. The only critique I have of the bag, is that the zipper sometimes gets caught on the corners when I'm trying to unzip the main compartment because of the shape. Makes me wonder how long it will last before I have to replace it.

..

34793627 I purchased this camera for a trip to Mexico and it exceeded my expectations especially for the price. My boyfriend had the camera in his pocket at the swim up bar for probably 1/2 at a time and it still took excellent pictures. I was a little concerned with it "popping" open after installing the battery, however, no leaks and it stayed shut. Must purchase MicroSD card separately. Remember to clean off the lenses after being in water.

Remove dust and fingerprints from your camera's optical lens with this LensPen NLP-1 cleaner that features a self-replenishing tip with a carbon cleaning compound that lets you clean your lens up to 500 times.


..

34793627 Honestly I still haven't got to use it but i think its must have thing! I like it so far!!!

..

34793627 I keep one of these in my travel camera kit and one at home. The soft brush is great for the glass as well as clearing off camera body.

..

34793627 It came ontime. Nice packageing and case. Good for everyday uses

..

34793627 I am no expert on using the lens cleaners. In fact, this is the first time I bought a lens cleaner. I am overall satisfied with this product. Carbon head could have been made a little better in terms of quality.

..

34793627 The quality of this lens pen is much higher than other off brand pens I have used. This pen is actually a smaller one, but when you open the package you instantly notice a difference in weight and sturdiness compared to full size lens pens of other brands. This pen is contoured with a kind of ergonomic design. Something I noticed right away is the brush end of this pen DOES NOT lose hairs like pens I have used in the past which is a huge plus when you are using it to clean a DSLR camera and lens! I will be purchasing more of these pens.

This shoulder bag features water-resistant material to protect against water damage and a padded interior for durability. The adjustable shoulder strap provides comfortable use.


..

34793627 The camera bag is a good bag for the price, but I wish it was a little bit bigger for my Nikon camera. It fits snug so when putting the camera in with the strap attached it is a tight fit. Overall I like the big just wish it was bigger.

..

34793627 
This shoulder bag features nylon, polyester and tricot materials with a padded interior for protection and an adjustable shoulder strap for comfortable wear. The water-resistant material prevents water damage.


..

34793627 This bag is acceptable, but is worth less than the $26.48 that I paid for it.

..

34793627 I like the material and size of the bag. It can fit my GF3 with 14-42mm len. And I can put additional batteries as well

Water and camera equipment in the same bag used to spell disaster. The DryZone Rover is the world's first backpack designed to safely carry both a hydration system and camera gear all inside the same bag. The unique design of the DryZone Rover allows you to comfortably store camera equipment or other water sensitive items in the waterproof lower compartment while providing quick access to personal storage space above. Remove the padded camera insert from the lower drypod and you instantly have a multi-purpose waterproof pack.


..

34793627 Love this thing, took it hiking ALL over NM. Stood up to all the abuse I could give it and kept my DSLR safe!!

34793627 
This backpack is compatible with most DSLR cameras and features nylon and polyester construction to ensure long-lasting use. The ultracinch camera chamber provides a snug fit.


..

34793627 This is a wonderful product. The Photo Sport can carry my Nikon D3200 kit body and lens plus my 55-300 mm lens. The many pouches make it so I can carry my tripod, poles, and personal items (sunscreen, water, sunglasses, jacket, etc.). This is a fabulous day pack for the hiking photo enthusiast. The design is compact and light. It worked great for a festival this weekend, and I can't wait to use it out my many camping trips to come.

..

34793627 There are hundreds of backpacks and hundreds of camera bags out there. Yet somehow a large portion of both have MAJOR flaws preventing them from being useful as either backpacks or as camera bags.
Somehow, Lowepro did both, and did them both right, in a single product.
The pack holds my D700 with 16-35 attached, plus an extra 70-300 VR. There's a little extra space outside the padded enclosure where i slip my filter wallet.
I've taken it hiking several times, and it's COMFORTABLE, even with a bit of weight.
I've also tried biking to work with it, in the rain, it fits my 12" laptop tightly but securely, and keeps it dry, even without the rain cover, which i removed.
I chose orange over black to prevent overheating in direct sunlight, but the orange doesn't match my orange jacket well (whine whine whine)
Price is actually pretty good for a brand name backpack even without the photo capacity. Add to the fact that LowePRO warrants it for LIFE and will replace it if it falls apart in normal use, and it's a steal!
The pack is able to hold my 5-pound CF tripod and head on the side, but it seems better suited to a smaller tripod. Also, the hydration pouch is placed such that it seems like there's a bit too much strain put on the zipper, and might be a long term issue. This is as much as i can come up with to complain about.

Carry your digital camera in this bag that features a contoured, asymmetrical shape for a snug, protective fit.


..

34793627 I have a Nikon D3200 with a 18-55 mm lens and it fits that perfect, and has room for other accessories. But if you have a bigger lens or more then one lens it will be to small. Other than that it is a great bag and works great when traveling on air planes or walking around taking pictures. It also has a good water proof cover if your on boats or it starts raining.

Make your favorite recipes with this KitchenAid Professional 600 Series KP26M1XER stand mixer that features 10-speed control for a wide range of settings. The stainless-steel bowl features a 6-quart capacity to hold large quantities of ingredients.


..

42809500 So easy! Just add ingredients and continue adding while the mixer is running. The bowl lift design keeps the bowl steady and secure while mixing. The consistency of each of my batters have turned out perfectly. I am truly amazed each time I use my mixer and look forward to my next creation! The power is awesome. I haven't found anything it cannot handle. I love this mixer!

..

42809500 Wanted bigger bowl capacity and more power, so upgraded my old Kitchen Aid. Not sure I will keep this item. Do not like that has no tilt head. Do not like how beaters have to be removed before you can take the bowl out of the stand. Am still working on getting the motion to put the bowl in place in the 3 lock areas. Will use it several times in the next week and decide if I want to keep it.

..

42809500 Purchased this for my wife to make Challah for Shabbat. The mixer has made it so easy for her. It is easy to use right out of the box. The only person upset is one of my kids who liked to perform the kneading part.

..

42809500 Kitchen Aid is a fantastic mixer. It supports all of my families baking needs.

..

42809500 I love size and power of this mixer. Great for making bread and cookies.

..

42809500 I like the the fact that I can make huge amounts of things I can mix in it!

..

42809500 This mixer is very easy to use. From making cooking dough to cakes to even mixing my meatloaf - it is so convenient!

..

42809500 Pizza dough any time I want? Yes please! Please? Please! Pleaaaase!!!

..

42809500 I love my KitchenAid. I have had a KitchenAid stand mixer for at least 15 years and it's still going strong. I wanted a 600 series and splurged. It is a great addition and is used frequently.

..

42809500 Make sure to hand wash the attachments even though they say top rack safe. I made the mistake of washing the flat blender in the dishwasher and it ruined it. But the replacement part was simple to find on Kitchen Aide. com and was only 14 dollars. You live and learn. The color will go with all the dcor we will go through in the years to come. The mixer is extremely well build. The options of how to use it are endless.

40308831 For the price I wasn't expecting much nor do I need anything fancy...hence ordering this laptop. But the computer is very scuffed and beat up on the top. Fortunately it doesn't seem to bother how it runs. I've only had it for about 5 days and haven't used it much. But it gets wifi and prints what I need printed. The shipping time was great. Ordered it on a Thurs and received it that Saturday...can't complain about that. Over all I just wish it would had been clearer about the "shape" of the computer. To say its been lightly used is inaccurate.

40308831 My wife bought me this for xmas. Opened the box xmas day and everything was great. In less than 2 days I started getting white lines running across my screen. Call the seller and they tell me that they will will pay for me to ship laptop back and send another one as soon as they see the tracking number from my end. I think, well that's good customer service. Get the replacement D630, take it out of the box, run the startup program, and then try to find my wireless router. No luck at all, wont even give me the option to look for it. I go online for several hours trying to see if i can fix this at home without having to send it back again, because its after 4 CST and their techs are gone for the day, only to have no luck. My wife leaves work early today so she can get home before the tech peole for the 3rd party seller leave for the day, and they advise her that they have sent out another bad laptop and that they will send a new one out today. I have never had so much problems with refurbished items in my life. If you ask me, i dont think this seller does quality checks at all before putting the product out. I thoguht Best Buy would pick better companies to work with. I will never buy another laptop from them because of this.

I would not have purchased this product even at this price point had i known this because it is now going to cost me an additional $100 to upgrade to windows 7.

35411612 You get what you pay for. They are not very loud and when you turn them up they have a lot of static. If you don't care about sound quality and don't want to play loud music, these might be a decent option. The upside is that they are cheap, light and connect only with a USB cord.

35411612 I realize these are inexpensive speakers and I was buying them for my grandsons PC so wasn't expecting top of the line, but these hummed so bad I unplugged them and put them back in the box. For now he'll stick with his headphones.

..

35411612 Nice speakers, good value.
Good sound just slightly better
Than the laptop speakers.
Speakers are to lite weight
Though.., tx.

..

35411612 The sound quality is terrible. If you try and turn the sound up on the speakers themselves you get a lot of static type noise. I'm gonna try them for a few days.

..

35411612 I bought these speakers for my office computer. I was hoping for a better sound, but for $8, it does the trick. I don't play the speakers loud at all, it's on very low to not bother other people outside of my office. If you're going to use them just for personal use, i.e. music at your desk then they are perfect. There is a static noise that comes through the speakers ever so often. I don't recommend these speakers to anyone who is using them as their primary set but as a second set for mediocre listening.

..

35411612 Generally, the sound system is very good and cute but the weight is too light. Also, if I would have wished that the USB powered be converted to a power supply powered.

..

35411612 I picked up the speakers from the post office, unpacked them and found out that they don't work. Granted that they were like $7, I am not going to try to return them or anything, too much of a hassle. So my advise would be to invest a few more bucks and buy something that you like.

..

35411612 Its good for a spare
Other than that its okay for beginner speakers
For music

..

35411612 Sound Quality is not good, even the price is cheap.

..

35411612 I really like the color of this phone case and it helps protect my iphone very well. The only think I didn't like is that the removable rubber parts fall out too easily.

This mini wall phone features a single-gong ringer with volume control for a soothing tone. The slide mount allows for easy setup.


..

35411612 Had to buy a wall mount plate. My other wall phone just had to use 2 wall anchor screws. Ring is nauseating bell. No way to change it. It does work though so I guess that's a good thing. Took almost a week to be delivered to the store and there was inadequate notification of its arrival at store.

..

35411612 A very good phone. It will work even whenever power goes out.

Your PlayStation 3 Slim has provided hours of exciting, immersive entertainment. You've battled creatures from other worlds, fought alongside fellow comrades, sped across the finish line and more. So it's important that you take care of your console and do your best to prevent damage. After all, you'd soon be reaching uncharted boredom territories without it.The Horizontal Cooling Power Station utilizes two built-in cooling fans to keep airflow to your console at an optimal level. With the power save mode and TempSense technology, you can rest assured that your PlayStation 3 Slim is staying cool enough without wasting power. The Station's horizontal design makes it simple to store your console in limited spaces, so you can easily keep things organized. Three ports allow you to charge controllers and more, right from the USB hub. With this Cooling Power Station, you can not only power up other devices and enjoy easy storage, but you're also able to take care of your console to ensure many more hours of gaming adventures.


..

35411612 I got this product because my PS3 is on a shelf with low clearance and I wanted to draw away the heat from that space. I opened an airway in the back of my cabinet but it was still not enough cooling airflow getting through so I bought this cooling station to get rid of all that trapped heat. It works very well for that purpose and I like that it has an automatic setting switch, what I am not as happy with is that it was a little bulkier then I thought and made a tight space tighter and the fans are somewhat louder then I'd like. If the fans could be made quieter I would rate this product higher then I did and I would buy another one of these ps3 coolers if a quieter version of this product becomes available.

 dreamGEAR's 5-in-1 Fitness Bundle is the perfect solution for the active Wii Fit gamer. It has all the essential items including, a Rechargeable Battery Pack to keep your Wii Balance Board ready for use, a Jeli Sleeve that adds traction and protection, a Travel Bag for portability, Textured Socks for added grip and a Fitness Mat. The Fitness mat can also be used for your regular Yoga or Pilates exercise routine. Get everything you need for your Wii Balance Board in this amazing bundle!! 


..

35411612 After reading the review that stated the battery pack damaged the balance board, I guess I'm glad the battery pack that came with mine did not work. I did not know it did not work until I had thrown away the packaging material. I like the balance board cover. The socks were too small for me - womans shoe size 91/2 but my niece uses them.

..

35411612 I was very excited when I bought my wii fit and thought this would be a wise purchase to compliment it. I never took any of the products out of the box which goes to show you how much you really need any of this stuff. I am planning on returning it since it is still unopened. $60 is really not worth a pair of socks, a jelly protector, a dumpy bag, and a battery pack that apparently isn't even any good according to the other reviews. Save your money and buy a new game instead!

..

35411612 You will not get what you ordered and what you do get isn't worth the price paid.

..

35411612 The set is okay, but the travel bag fits way too tight. I use the leg extenders for carpet and I have to remove them just to get it in the bag!

..

35411612 After using the recharging pack for 4 days. our balance board won't work . I
called nintendo and they said because I used the deamworks recharging
back (a non registered nintendo product) it void my warantee. And the
recharging pack caused the damage.

..

35411612 Lets put it this way, if you are really into staying healthy with the help of the wii fit, then you might want to go all out and get all the accessories to get the "gym workout feeling" No where NEAR being a must have

This Eclipse ECL180G2PU 4GB* video MP3 player's rechargeable lithium-ion battery delivers up to 8 hours of operating time, enabling you to listen to your favorite songs or view a variety of visual media for extended periods.


..

35411612 To summarize: DONT. It takes the songs and puts them in alphabetical order and wont update to the catagories most of the time when you add more songs. VERY FRUSTRATING.

..

35411612 I would recommend it to all my friends if they're looking for something to carry around in their pockets.

..

35411612 This MP3 player is a great value for the money. It is not expensive or deluxe, so if you have that in mind it can be a great one for you. It is basic, the screen isn't a high resolution screen, but it is decent for what it is. I wish it had more storage capacity, as 8GB should be the minimum that they should sell in my opinion nowadays. At least it has a microSD card slot to expand the memory. This would be great for a small kid or someone that wants an almost disposable (at this price) MP3 player to take on the train ride to work or some other place that you wouldn't want to lose or break a more expensive model.

..

35411612 We never could get the music loaded onto the player - it hung up in the middle of loading so we took it back for a refund.

..

35411612 The MP3 player works great but the camera is not good at all. It's dark and can barely see the picture. Ok for the price.

..

35411612 MicroSD don't work, you can not load music direct onto MicroSD (still cant get it to work) easy to "drag and drop" music files into unit file.
Instructions are vague at best. vary hard to use to the controlls, good duribility and sound quality. nothing special about this player. great for first time user or "back up" unit... Not realy worth the money unless you get it on the "deal of the day"

..

35411612 I like this MP# player. I have had it for almost a month. Great for gym workouts.

..

35411612 This MP3 player was purchased for a young person as a gift. She enjoys using it. Now that smartphones have so many functions it's not as easy to find good straightforward MP3 players as it once was but this seems to be a good one and a pretty good value.

..

35411612 The device is nice and simple. It wasfor a 12 year old boy.

35411612 Purchased for my son who loves music and love that he can store all his Michael Jackson

Learn how to play the guitar with this instructional pack that includes a full-size, spruce-top sequoia acoustic guitar for hands-on learning experience and a nylon gig bag for easy portability. The Guitar Method CD-ROM features more than 160 lessons.


..

35411612 One of my continual promises was to learn guitar, so I finally fullfilled this promise and purchased this package. Overall, I'm very pleased.
The software hits the sweat spot - easy to follow, good instruction. The videos and animated sequences are easy to follow and mimic I'm playing a few simple songs now, after about 20 hours of practice.
The quality of the guitar is good, not great. It's certainly adaquate for a beginner and a good value at this price point, but as your skills increase, you should be looking at spending a couple of hundred bucks for the next upgrade in quality.

Protect your FUJIFILM digital camera with this bag that features faux crocodile material for guarding against dust and scratches and a bowler design for a stylish look.


..

35411612 At the very end of 2010, a couple days before Christmas to be exact I purchased the Fuji fine pix S4080 and wanted a good size bag with enough protective padding. This one was great and it double as a purse for quite a while. I've had several cameras and various bags and this one is my favorite. The Fuji Fine Pix S4080 is the same size as the newer 4500 model and will take up half the interior of the bag. With the movable padded divider you will have enough space on the other half to fit wires, spare batteries and wallet to hold cards and cell phone. As I said, the padded divider is movable to acomidate a smaller or larger camera. To sum it up, I love it because my camera is well protected and Its size and style suit my needs because it illiminates the need to carry an additional bag.

..

35411612 I have handheld phones in basically every room including bathrooms. My kitchen isn't that large, however, it seems the phone rings when I'm there sooooo I bought this little phone for a reasonable price, plugged it into the jack & wala'........ Perfect fit for what I wanted & clarity is excellent!

..

35411612 i like the low, medium, high feature, and the low, high feature for the sound of it when it rings, but this is the second one. a family member set the first one we had down too hard and it broke.

..

35411612 I am pleased to find a wired phone that will, of course, work when the power goes out. I don't have to hold the off button down to turn it on.

..

35411612 I needed a basic, corded phone at a good price, and this was it! It has a clear sound, and is very compact, so it doesn't take much room.

..

35411612 Nice phone for the price..first one I received did not work..disappointed ,especially after waiting 9 days for it to come to a local Best Buy. Had to wait another 9 days for the replacement. , which worked. Tried to buy a wall phone locally at Walmart, Target, or K-mart, to no avail, I needed a specific 3" wide one, Best Buy was the only store that had them. Hopefully, your first phone will actually work, there was no problem with the exchange at the store.

Protect your point-and-shoot digital camera from bumps and scratches with this hard camera case.


..

35411612 this camera case is durable, versatile, and a great price. I like that theres a strap and you can connect the case to your camera without it being in the way, and this way you won't lose it. There is no room for extra batteries or pockets for anything if that is what you are looking for. The best thing about it is that it is a hard shell case which prevents the camera from getting smashed.

..

35411612 I ordered this case on Best Buy's website for store pickup along with my Panasonic Zs8 camera. When I first saw the case I thought the camera wouldn't fit in it, but it fits perfectly. This is a great case. it's hard and firm. Rest assure your camera will be safe.

..

35411612 There's not much to say about this case except that it's doing its job well! It's not completely hard (those cases tend to be big and boxy), but it's thick and hard enough to keep my camera protected in my big, overly cluttered purse that's swimming with sharp, pointy objects. I've actually completely ruined a camera before by putting it in my purse without a case (it was just an hour or so!). A pen ended up puncturing the screen, which led to some other issues. My current camera has remained scratch- and puncture-free for a couple of months now, despite the fact that it resides in the same dangerous environment as the last camera.
I like the sturdy loop connected to the zipper too. It's got rubber over the part that would undergo the most chafing if you were to hang it off of something, so you don't have to worry about the cord fraying. There's also a little pocket inside the case where you could put a couple extra memory cards or other small items, which is nice.

..

35411612 The size they tell you is for the outside of the case. The inside is way smaller my normal size camera did not fit!

..

35411612 This item is very durable and takes good care of the camera.

..

35411612 This case came in a bundle with a camera and SD card. It is a sturdy case with a zipper that covers 3 sides, so it opens nicely. opens 90 degrees so it won't flop completely open. Fits most commonly used cameras, so nothing over sized or professional. If you think whether or not you should get a case for your camera, don't think twice! If this will hold your camera you should get it!

..

35411612 Good point and shoot camera with easy up load to Facebook etc.

..

35411612 Good quality photos. Shutter lag is a bit slow. Size is GREAT for carrying in your pocket and having handy for quick shots.

..

35411612 This case is great for quick use and can clip to your belt. The belt clip frees up your hands in between taking pictures. I have used it for boating and at the beach. great for protecting camera from water in between taking pictures. A great price also.

..

35411612 This camera case came with my Kodak M550 camera for free, so I don't have many complaints, but constructive comments. I think the case would be good for someone who only uses a point-and-shoot and doesn't need to carry any extra supplies with them, such as me, as I am just taking pictures as I tour Germany. It is a tad bit small, and barely squeezes the USB cord into one of its pouches; that makes the case look chunky when closed. Anyway, I am satisfied with the case, but there are definitely better ones out there.

..

35411612 Got this smoker for my husband for his Birthday/Our Anniversary this year. He loves it. So easy to use and he can control/monitor the temperature from indoors.

..

35411612 Long time fan of smoked foods first time foray into smoking food for myself and my family results have been terrific.
Window on front and Internal light Great combination (I like to see whats going on without opening the door and letting out all the smoke an heat).
2 way Remote control allows you to remotely monitor temp' of the unit, temp' of the food being cooked, time elapsed and should you need to make changes to fine tune the process on the fly you can do it all with the remote.(My experience is remote works fine at 40' away through regular drywall/siding house walls).
Racks and water bowl remove for easy cleaning in the sink, inside of smoker box wipes down relatively easily just go careful with your hands behind the box were the heating elements and wood chips smoke.
Temp' and time setting electronically very easy and convenient.

This turkey fryer features an electronic timer that lets you keep track of cook times for optimal results. The auto shutoff function ensures safe operation and a stainless-steel thermometer enables precise cooking.


..

35411612 I complained about the 'Stainless Steel' in the Title line, According to them it applies only to the accessories, not the Aluminum Pot and Lid. Although it says Aluminum in the Detail the Title says STAINLESS STEEL.
I requested it be reviewed for accuracy because it is NOT accurate. I returned the item because of this.

..

35411612 Have tried for a couple of days to contact BB via chat ... In queue then no one available or just none available. Anyway the reason for this review is that the description in NOT correct. This model is NOT stainless. Typo ... maybe. Also, it has the shortest warranty for fryers in the class ... 90 days vs 1 year.

Extend Ethernet connectivity to your Internet-ready devices via coaxial cables with these Actiontec ECB2500CK01 MoCA network adapters, which deliver high-speed Internet connectivity while maintaining cable TV signal integrity.


..

35853342 I use these with my Tivo's. They were very easy to set-up and are fast and reliable. Streaming is a breeze now.

..

35853342 Upgraded to these from Belkin powerline networking adapters. Within 10 minutes of opening the box, I was streaming 1080p from computers upstairs with no hiccups. Paired this with a 5 port switch to hook up Tivo, WDTV, and two game systems to my home network. Read up on the standards before purchase. DirectTV & Dish use some of the same bandwidth over coax, so that may cause issues; I've had none with Time Warner. Great alternative if you have neither the money or skill to run networking cables through your house.

..

35853342 We recently purchased a Tivo Roamio and a Tivo Mini. To use the Tivo Mini, we needed to create a MOCA network in our house and this was the product we needed to do that. It was very easy to set up. It took just a few minutes to plug in both adapters following the instructions included with this product and on Tivo's website. We couldn't believe that once plugged in (one adapter into our router and cable modem and the second adapter into our Tivo Roamio), we had a fast MOCA connection throughout our house and the Tivo Mini worked great. It's more expensive than I would have expected but it works!

..

35853342 Easy to follow install instructions, just be sure no cable amplifiers between the units. Doesn't seem to worry about splitters. Check out the Actiontec website and Google MoCA for lots more info on these. True Ethernet speed at the user end, steady as a rock 1080P streaming at my home theater, 2 floors & 30 ft. from the router upstairs. Never could get good WiFi there. Put a cheap Ethernet switch ($15) there and I run up to 8 devices off this little guy (currently 6) Great if you are already wired for cable and want full Ethernet speed at any location where you have or can run a coax outlet. Much easier than pulling cat 5 cable around your house. These things just work.

..

35853342 My set top box from the cable company is now a video storage device on my network allowing access to recordings from my PS3. Wireless network in the home can be a problem with all the neighbors having an overlapping signal. Also the speed can very based on the signal. Using these adapters I have a high speed wired network and no need to install cat 5 cable in my home!

Belkin F4U020 4-port USB Hub - USB - External - 4 USB Port(s)


..

35853342 I bought this the 4 port powered usb hub. I only wish I would of got the belkin 7 port usb powered hub but it was sold out online at the time of my purchase. I trust belkin as I was introduced to the brand with my belkin wireless router. I use this 4 port powered usb hub with my iMac computer and it works great now drivers needed and I like the plug n play compatibility. I have two external Western Digital Hard drives hooked up to my iMac via the belkin usb powered hub. I like powered over non-powered because devices that need powered usb connection will always work with this device since it is plugged into a separate power source. I have not tried charging a iPhone or mp3 player yet via this belkin powered usb hub but I have read in other reviews that it will charge devices since this hub is powered.

35853342 great quality, very compact, easy to assemble and transport and light weight

..

35853342 Love the picture quality and am very pleased with the sound quality for only 10 watts.

..

35853342 i just bought this projector today ! i hooked it up and realized that the throw on it was not really adjustable at all, i had my previous projector at 15 feet and thats where i put this one and it was way too big ! the menu does not have the option to change width and height ! you have to buy a more expensive one for that ! it was pretty loud too, it kinda made this rickety sound that was not even ! the picture seemed really good but then again it was hard to tell when part of it is on the ceiling cuz the picture wont adjust ! im returning it my sharp projector i had before had alot more options ! nearly the same price too ! 2 years earlier ! im not trying to be harsh against this projector just giving an honest review ! im not too picky either

..

35853342 Purchased this larger screen so I can read messages.

..

35853342 I'm a daily casual gamer in several games. I bought this monitor to upgrade from a 22" primarily because of the great deal I got. It is amazing how much of a difference 5 inches makes. Great display and I love how I can also run my PS4 through it. I do use headsets for both the PS4 and computer so can't comment on the speakers.

..

35853342 I am a dual-monitor user, I actually use 3 monitors at work. This monitor is replacing a 23" and I was afraid it would be too large, but it is the perfect size for staying productive.
Pros:
The screen size and pixel density is great as long as you don't sit right up on the monitor. Keep at least an arm length away to not notice the individual pixels. The price point of this monitor makes it viable to obtain 2 of the screens to replace 3x 23" monitors. The bezel is narrow enough to allow transition from one monitor to another without a lot of disturbance. The brightness of the screen is very nice when there is too much sunlight flooded into the room.
Cons:
The cons listed for this monitor are a little "picky" on my part. The speakers on the monitor are not good as the monitor is rather thin, not giving enough room for the speaker driver to gain much bass. But in all honesty, no one is purchasing this monitor for the speakers, as a gamer, I am using my headphones or when listening to music I have a speaker set connected to the computer.
The two annoyances I have are related to the initial setup:
1. Connected the monitor to HDMI and it stated "HDMI not connected." So I had to use the supplied VGA cable to initially connect the monitor to my desktop and once the image was displayed, I could switch to my HDMI cable. This isn't a deal-breaker, but it can be annoying when you have to locate a DVI -> VGA adapter for your video card.
2. As many have said previously, the OSD and buttons are not intuitive at all. It is rather slow to navigate through the menus to change any of the color settings on the monitor. After you get used to where the settings are, it becomes much easier. This is me being picky as I would have liked to see a more intuitive menu to use when trying to adjust all of the settings for this monitor.
Overall, this monitor is GREAT! I love the picture quality and once you can get past the initial set-up and the clunky OSD, then you are all set for a productive working environment.

..

35853342 this thing rocksssssssssssss period i like it alot its much bigger than i thought

..

35853342 The screen is big and bright. Price is nice too. The only thing I can complain is that you can't adjust the height.

..

35853342 Had to dig to find some info. Great monitor for any price. I use HDMI to hook up and it is so bright I don't need room light. My computer is several years old yet fully compatible. It seems to slow down some functions ever so slightly but who cares given the results.

..

35853342 I bought this monitor to play games on when it was on sale for $200. It has a beatiful picture, with a spot-on color palette right out of the box. I've been playing games on it for a month now and haven't noticed any signal lag issues such as ghosting. It's also very easy on the eyes, with no noticable eye strain during extended gaming sessions. If you're a serious gamer who is looking for the best money can buy then look no further than BenQ. Highly recommended for enthusiats

..

35853342 without spending $800-$1000 on a high quality 27" LED monitor, you can't beat this one for the price!. Resolution is bright, clear and crisp and works great for all my home PC needs! The screen is definitely large enough to easily multi-task applications at one time. No problem viewing my slingbox while still checking email or working on other applications! I was hesitant to purchase since I couldn't find a one to view at nearby stores, but am glad I decided to take a chance!

..

35853342 Having researched other 25-27 inch monitors, I find this BenQ model is an excellent value. Its performance in terms of response rate, color depth, and available connection options...combined with very good asthetics make this unit a great selection for my needs. I use this primarily for GAMING. I play World of Warcraft, Call of Duty series, and MMOs World of Tanks and the WarThunder beta ..extensively. The monitor performs as well as ,or better than , the LG IPS panel on my work PC (that was a $600 monitor new). I'm using an EVGA GTX660 Ti FTW 2GB GPU. The combination provides stunning performance in FPS games and noticibly vibrant dark colors (black#, particularly when watching DVDs. I elected to use DVI to DVI cable since I had an extra Monster cable on hand. AND, to my pleasant surprise, I was able to save appx. $27 from my usual online PC supply vendor!
For anyone considering a 25-27 inch monitor.. for ANY application... consider this BenQ model. I'm confident you will be pleased!
NOTE: Monitor is equiped with internal speakers. While this is a handy feature, temper your expections regarding them.. particularly with Gaming applications... Go with external powered speakers #Klipsh/Corsair/Logitech, IMO).

..

35853342 I bought this monitor with because I wanted a cheap but good one. I did do some research on it and everthing seemed great especially for the low price tag with a 27 inch monitor. I use it for gaming and computer the only problem I have with it is it only has one HDMI input so one would have to unplug a cable to plug in another. The picture quality is great. The built in speakers are not the best but I have other speakers that play the audio anyway. Overall a 9/10 monitor in the price range. No problems yet.

Enjoy your favorite music with these bookshelf speakers that feature 6-1/2" poly/graphite woofers and custom 3/4" poly soft dome tweeters to ensure crisp, clear audio.


..

35853342 Used as rear speakers in a medium to large room. High power receiver & audiophile main speakers w/an audiophile SACD & cables. @ 90db and 8ohms these are a relatively easy load for any amp./reciever. They are not a new design but rather an update of an older design that seems fairly practical. 6-1/2"woofer w/butyl surround and a soft-dome tweeter. The box is standard-issue matte-black-and SOLID>very well built, also featuring the 'venturi' style port for extended bass. THIS DESIGN WORKS!!
Very solid bass pretty well extended for a smallish speaker.Never have i heard bass distortion even when i push them. The sound is natural w/great dynamics and shimmering highs. not metallic or syballent.--wider than expected staging also. All in all a very very nice overall sound comparable to MUCH more expensive units,albeit in kindof a plain package.

..

35853342 They really look nice and sound verygood for a 2way speaker

..

35853342 I bought these to use in the garage but I would have no problem using them in the house, decent sound in a small package and they are perfect with my Pioneer SX201 reciever. keep in mind it has a small woofer but it still has some kick.

..

35853342 The Bic DV62si's sound average when you first play them. After 25 to 30-hours of play, the sound quality greatly improves. For their price range, I'm sure there isn't a pair of speakers that can compare to these. The sound quality could probably be improved if BIC would allow each driver to be amplified. However, the sound quality is very good without that feature, so I have no real complaints.
I play music a low volumes and am surprised how accurate these speakers are. I have a collection of speakers ranging from Cambridge Audio S-30s to Magnepans. The BIC speakers are a value for their sound quality.

..

35853342 Lets just say that my dad has paradigm speakers at his house and I was looking for a sound that was as great as them without the price. We got these in and hooked them up and they instantly rocked. We use them for everything: Music, Movies, Video games, you name it. All I can say is these speakers are awesome.

The 12" front-firing F-12 powered subwoofer incorporates a high current 475-watt peak amplifier designed by BASH Technology in combination with a 12" injection molded long-throw woofer. A patented BIC "Venturi" vent eliminates port noise which is often heard from other subwoofers, especially when playing demanding music and videos.


..

35853342 This is the first subwoofer I've purchased since selling off a pair of SVS PC12-NSD subs, so I was concerned that I might be underwhelmed by the BIC F-12 despite the rave reviews. I'm pleased to report that the F-12 fully lives up to the hype it receives.
Compared to the SVS subs (and likely other high-end brands such as Hsu), the F-12 doesn't go as low in terms of frequency response... but that isn't to say it is totally devoid of infrasonics! While it won't go below 20-something Hz, you will still feel the low frequencies in your music and movies. I actually have two F-12 subs stacked on top of each other in a corner, and they put out SPL (a measure of loudness) very similar to that of a single SVS PC12-NSD. One of the only things I miss about the SVS is that the sub could be whisper quiet while playing sub-20Hz audio and the only indication it was doing anything was the sound of windows rattling on the far end of the house. The F-12 won't do that, but I guess that is why you can buy four F-12s for roughly the price of a single SVS. I can only imagine how incredible four of these would sound...
It is a shame that this subwoofer doesn't have a 5 star rating on this site. A single 1 star rating has brought down the average for this magnificent speaker, which is very misleading since the only complaint was that the speaker was defective (and likely eligible for warranty service).
If you're currently without a subwoofer, using a small subwoofer or one that came with your home theater system, or even using a subwoofer from one of the well known brand names (sony, polk, etc...) then you will almost certainly be amazed at the difference adding a true subwoofer to your system will make. Just be sure to set it up properly. The instinct to turn the gain knob to 'max' is dead wrong. The included manual has fairly good instructions on how to set things up; I strongly suggest reading it if you've never set up a big subwoofer before.

..

35853342 Just a perfect Sub if you know how to install it. This subwoofer is pretty dang big, bigger than what i was expecting. Very solid build, the wood is real. The grill plate is heavy, solidly made and protect it well. I have to keep this unit turned down pretty low, it rocks the neighborhood.

..

35853342 i received this on 2/7/2013 and it gave out 2/10/2013 it seemed to be working fine and sounded pretty good while listening to music sunday afternoon it gave out. I am not sure whether to get it replaced by the vendor or just get my money back, The vendor will do either one my choice. just not sure if maybe it was a bad sub.

..

35853342 I bought this to add to a HT. This replaced a high end 10" sub that was blowing internal fuses and honestly was not big enough for the room it was moved to either. Having spent too much on the rest of my set up I took a chance at the price and am pleasantly surprised.
Delivered in 2 days, sub is attractive with a quality feel and appears well built.
Sound is great. I tuned it to my system and would say that I do not find it muddy, bass is clean at high volume.
Note that this is a large speaker which should be considered in your placement.
This is my first BIC purchase, I will definitely keep them in mind for future purchases.

Black & Decker DustBuster CHV1510 Portable Vacuum Cleaner - 25 W Air Watts - 20.60 fl oz - Bagless


..

35853342 I purchase the Black & Decker Dustbuster 15.6V. The machine does not hold it's charge. It works for only a minute or two and then it stops and needs to be recharged. In addition, the unit will not work when it is plugged in, so you need to wait until the unit gets recharged in order to use it again. I would not recommend this hand held vacuum.
I have contacted B & D to see what they want me to do with the vacuum....(don't have the original receipt of purchase.) Will keep all informed.

BlueParrott B250-XT Bluetooth Headset is a Professional grade wireless noise-canceling headset for Bluetooth cellular phones and Bluetooth enabled computers. Xtreme Noise Suppression blocks out background noise even the sound of an 18-wheeler's engine.


..

35853342 This was actually a gift to someone, and I was told by the receiver that this was the best bluetooth he ever had. He just would of loved it to extend a little longer over his head.

..

35853342 I just couldn't get over the bulk of the product. It's was like wearing a helmet.

..

35853342 The over the ear feature is more comfortable for me. The sound quality is good and the noise cnacelling feature allows me to hear the other person and not have to strain to listen and loose my concentraiton while driving.

..

35853342 Great headset with clear sound. I use for business conference calls with my iPhone.

..

35853342 I'm actually pleased with this, considering the quality of previous Bluetooth headsets I've had. Voices are clear; not as good as talking through the mouthpiece, but still much better than other BT headsets I've used. The only negative I have is the headband tends to drift. I can't quite seem to get it to stay where I want it on my head; it keeps slipping. Other than that, I'm quite pleased with this item.

..

35853342 After researching,This Bluetooth is one of the best

..

35853342 Overall, I'm now happy because of the poor speaker quality in the earpiece. The sound is very muffled and too low in tone. Sounds like all bass and no treble.

..

35853342 I have gone through jawbones, blue ants, and Plantronics.......so, as much as they all have their cool features, they all started out great but ended up the same. That is, they never stayed in place in my ear and actually hurt after long periods. I use it 50% of my workday and always found myself pushing it in my ear to hear better or get better quality sound(bass tones). Also, I use it on weekends when I drive my convertible and most just don't do the job with all the external road noise.
This one, however, is a nice product that satisfies all my needs. If you don't mind the old school, Janet Jackson look, then this one should put a smile on your face. Fits comfortably like the old Sony stereo headphones that used to cost $50 and up. I no longer have to push anything further into my ear as is has a fluffy cushion on the outside of the ear and has great quality sound. Everyone seems to hear me clearly, the only complaint I've received was that it sounded distant, maybe muted, but that was only one person out of 15 that I've asked, and I suspect maybe it was her headset's problem not mine. Also, read reviews by many big rig truckers who use it and all favorable. Would definitely recommend for practical purposes, not for stealth ability or fashion. Battery lasts the longest of all that I've tried! Go for it, if you don't mind looking like a telemarketer or a female R&B artist......no offense Janet, the "Control" album is the bomb.

..

35853342 The headset is comfortable and relatively easy to use. The buttons are close together and therefore it is easy to hit the wrong one when answering the phone.

..

35853342 My husband was looking for something for wearing while motorcycle riding but we've been using it around the house while doing chores. Everyone we talk to can't believe how good it sounds. And, it stays on your head when you bend over.

35853342 We needed a new printer in a hurry because children had school papers to print out. This one was easy to set up. We are very happy with the quality of the print. This printer has fewer paper jams than our last one and is much quieter. So far we are very happy with how long the ink cartridges last,

..

35853342 I had HP- 3-in-1 printer for years, and it finally broke. I made decision to buy Brother -3-in-1. So far I'm happy with my purchase

..

35853342 Compact design, fast and great print at low cost per page

..

35853342 I love having one machine at my finger tips it helps saving me time and steps. It truly named correct a smart machine.

..

35853342 The last 2 printers I had were fancy, expensive All-In-Ones designed for photos. Each lasted just long enough to be off warranty. I wanted to get back to basics, avoid 6 expensive ink cartridges, & get a quality printer that would last longer than a year. The Brother MFC-J4310DW fits the bill perfectly.
For printing on plain paper, coupons make for a good example... Colors are a bit muted, but the ink doesn't saturate the paper, with no wrinkling or coming through the other side. You can increase the amount of ink, but this is the default. Accuracy & sharpness are much better than the more expensive printers I had previously -- the bar codes on these work, where 2/3 of the time those from the photo printers did not. Text looks Very good, but that's a judgment call -- barcodes working at the supermarket is purely objective.
Networking features are great, but setting it up was really a pain. Everything else [cells, tablets, media players etc.] worked with WPS, where you push a button on the device & on the router & they find each other. I had to enter the very long network password using the printer's touchscreen -- NOT fun. You're supposed to be able to add the printer to networked PCs with just a single right-click -- that only partly worked, so I ran the regular setup, winding up with an extra printer & fax that didn't work. Once I got beyond that stuff it's great -- I can even scan using my Android tablet.
Finally, I love the ink cartridge set up - pop open a door on the front & there they are. That's something I really hadn't paid attention to when I looked at the Brother & bought it -- I mean, sticking in ink cartridges is not a big deal -- but I hadn't realized what a pain it was lifting up the top of my old printers until I put the new cartridges in. This is Great.

..

35853342 Brother products used to be boxy and unattractive. They seem to have gotten the message. This unit works great! I wish I had purchased the next model up with a document feeder for longer faxes, but this unit works great.

..

35853342 We have mainly used this printer for printing off our phones and our tablets. We haven't found anything that we don't like so far. Would always buy another brother printer if it was needed. It doesn't go through the ionk like an HP

..

35853342 This very good four in one printer.
It looks smart and easy to use

..

35853342 I really like this all in one printer, the only thing I do not like about it is where you have to hook up your phone line to it,took me forever to find the hook up. I love that it does a self cleaning all on its own and it is a touch screen.

..

35853342 I needed a wireless all in one Printer (printer / scanner/ copier / fax) to use at home primarily for documents. I looked at all the name brand ones before choosing this unit. Now a days it seems like all the quality printers are about equal, with the biggest difference being the cost of ink. Brother had the lowest cost for ink refills, and uses several different cartridges for color. So you only have to replace what is low, instead of a single (higher priced) cartridge like some other companies use. This particular model also has a small footprint, so it takes up less space. Along with being able to print from my laptop and iPhone, you can also connect directly to all the cloud storage services, and Facebook from the printer.
The only issue that I've had is getting my laptop to work reliably with it, though I think it might be that I don't have the correct ports set. I also don't like that it automatically shuts of, and can't be remotely woken to print. Though this might be possible, and I just haven't figured out how to yet (yes I'm a guy and don't always read all the instructions).
Overall though I am very happy with this machine.

A sleek look with a lower profile and fast, commercial-style coffee brewing for home. Brew the great-tasting coffee you love simply, quickly and consistently. Elegant upscale design compliments contemporary decor.


..

35853342 This is our 4th Bunn coffee maker. They are functionally great, but only last a few years. Make sure that you take this into account when you buy one. At $100, they aren't cheap, but they make a really fast pot of coffee and look great. Remember to turn off the coffee maker while on vacation!

..

35853342 I love bunn coffee makers I have bought them the past 35 years they make a pot of coffee in three mins and it taste very good also.
I have family members and friends that we so impressed with my bunn that they also have went out and purchased bunn coffee makers.
They used to come with the water pitchers to fill the coffee maker and they do not have that anymore I still have one from about ten years ago that i still use because years ago as so as you put water in it started making coffee now they have the lids so it will not start brewing till you slide or put the lid down but I do not like to use the pot for measuring the water so I still use my old picher.

..

35853342 I wanted a good coffee maker, but didn't want to spend too much. This Bunn makes great tasting, smooth, coffee, even when I use cheap stuff. I love the speed at which I can brew a full pot of coffee. less than 4 minutes.

..

35853342 We love the fact it only takes 3 minutes to brew. I just had to buy our second coffee maker just like this one its been over 8 years since I bought the first one. All of the friends and families I know have had to replace theirs of the other brands. I'll keep my bunn. ALWAYS

..

35853342 I never knew how bitter my coffee was prior to having my Bunn. Taste is night and day, so smooth at the perfect drinking temperature. My only disappointment is that I cannot set a timer to brew in the morning before work, even through it only takes minutes to brew I still like it sitting and waiting for me... However the price and quality is so much better I forget about the extra few minutes it takes me in the morning with every tasty sip.

..

35853342 had the same kind before for 7 years. It worked great and kept the coffee hot. This new one does not !!!!!

..

35853342 Got for in home use. Brews a full pot of coffee in about 3 minutes. Flavor and quality is excellent however the cost is a bit higher than others. An aspect I didn't know before purchase is that for it to brew fast you must leave the unit on continuously (24/7) to heat the water. So I would only recommend this to someone that drinks coffee routinely. Have not noticed an increase in the electric bill yet. Unit is very nice looking on the counter top with just about any color scheme as it is black and stainless.

..

35853342 Best coffee maker ever. I own one, bought 1 for my Dad and this one was a gift. Holds whole pot of hot water, so when you want to make coffee....it brews instantly! No bad side. If you are a big coffee drinker....you need this!

..

35853342 I've always liked this style and the white color is so clean. Very dependable and brewing in 3 mins for 10 cups is perfect.

..

35853342 Overall it's a great coffe maker. The secret is the hot water always ready and the spray nozzle. I don't think it's going to last as long as our first Bunn coffe maker. That one lasted 5 years. There are also some sharp edges on the back that scrape the counter if your not careful. If you have the Bunn under a upper cabinet , to fill it you must pull it out and then put it back. We really scratched up our solid surface with our last one.
Still, it makes a great cup of coffe

CAD U2 USB Stereo Headset - Wired Connectivity - Stereo - Over-the-head


..

35853342 Headphones are great. Sound quality is superb. Price. Ten ft cord is nice to walk around if you need to grab something.

..

35853342 Just a warning: if you have normal hearing, these headphones amplify sound. I had to turn down my PC's sound setting to a 1 (on a scale of 1-100# since there is no way to turn the amplification down or off. #It might be a good choice for someone with a hearing deficiency.) Also, I used them on Skype today for the first time and the microphone didn't work. Not sure if that's the result of a setting or a defect. So overall, not the best choice for me.

..

35853342 I really can only think of one thing to complain about on this pair of headphones. YOU CAN'T FLIP THE DIRECTION OF THE MICROPHONE! I'd really prefer to have the microphone on the right side of my head, but it's locked so it has to be on the left. This is unfortunate, but a minor setback on a really great product. As long as you can deal with that little tidbit, I'd definitely recommend it.

..

35853342 Just got them to today really cool, once u get use to them and read the booklet that comes with it u should be O.K. I reccommend to anyone really really cool product.

..

35853342 I found these guys by accident... I own a couple other CAD Audio products. The NB2 noise canceling earbuds rock... so i decided to try the U2... Wow again I am impressed.

Safeguard your 13" Apple MacBook Pro from damage with this Case Logic PAS-213BLA sleeve that features a neoprene exterior and a suede interior to give dual-layer protection. A zippered Power Pocket provides a convenient place to store a power cord.


..

35853342 The case fits my laptop perfectly. The outer pocket with the slot for a flash drive is also very useful. The padding help protect the laptop. Would definitely recommend this to others.

Safeguard your laptop with this Case Logic VNAI-215BL top-loading case that features an internal divider to keep important documents apart from other items. Padding in the laptop compartment protects your device.


..

35853342 Purchased this bag to carry my computer it. Has many pockets and fits the computer real well. Would recommend it.

..

35853342 When I ordered this item I thought it would zip open and the top would fold back, like a suitcase. I misread the description and was a little disappointed when i got it. However, after i started using it, it was great. Easy to use, pouches for my mouse any pens I may want, and even a spot to hold my phone in the front zip area. The main area had room for my laptop, notepads, papers, and that is where I put my power cord. Comfy over the shoulder strap.

..

35853342 I don't use this constantly so it's perfect for me. It looks great and all the equipment fits nicely. I don't think it would stand up to a lot of wear and tear.

..

35853342 This carrying case is great. Its light wet, thin, and durable. The case also have many compartments for papers, pens or what ever you decide in them, It has an strap that doesn't case the skin to go raw as well hand holders.

..

35853342 The case logic briefcase is very light weight and i carry my HP 15 inch laptop and it hole my charger.books ,pen case and my mouse perfect all at the same time.I will buy another one.

..

35853342 If you're looking for a compact bag, and don't need to add books or other bulky items, this bag is amazingly good for the very inexpensive price. It's fairly well padded (though not as much as some others) and seems as if it will last a while. The shoulder strap is adjustable so you can carry it over one shoulder, like a pocketbook, or over the opposite shoulder, like a messenger bag. The strap is removable in case you prefer looking more business-like and using the double handles to carry the bag.
All in all, for the price, you probably can't do better than this. I carry it every day to different locations and, so far, after more than a month of use, it still looks and feels brand new.

Casio Printing Calculator - 12 Character(s) - Power Adapter, Battery Powered


..

35853342 I have been looking for a replacemnet to my old printing calculator. Most of the ones that I found are full size and only 110 powered. I wanted a small one for my desk that could also be used on battery power. The keyboard is also great and very responsive. Very satisfied with the purchase.

Until the gray rubber peeled off. Now it doesn't hold my laptop. Hopefully BestBuy will let me return it, but I doubt it...

This portable handset amplifier uses Clarity Power technology to make phone conversations clearer, louder and easier to understand.


..

35853342 Couldn't get the phone line to hook into it because the space for it was too narrow (or to wide, I cannot remember). It was tried at my mother's (where it was purchased for), my brothers, and my house and none of our lines would fit into the area allowed for the phone line to plug into it. It was either our lines were too wide or their one line was too wide, I don't remember, I do remember thinking who in the world did they make this for?
But Best Buy was great and immediately refunded our purchase price.

..

35853342 Expensive hearing aid did not help hard of hearing on phone. Clarity HA-40 makes phone comunication available - amplification more than adequate - easy to install and adjust - this is the best there is - before we purchased we researched it and others and bought three at one time without even testing one!

..

This 400-watt power supply features dual +12V rails to provide ample power to additional hard drives and components for enhanced performance.


..

35853342 as expected, delivered prompt;y, worked as advertised

..

35853342 I didn't want to spend a lot of money to just replace a power supply. If I wanted to spend over $100, I would just replace the PC.

..

35853342 I added a graphics card to my kids' low-end HP desktop so they could play some more advanced games, but the factory power supply wasn't quite beefy enough to support them. This one provided plenty of ceiling for the additional card at a very budget friendly price. It fit perfectly in the case and is very quiet in operation. The only negative is that the instructions were a bit confusing. They were essentially a (very) short series of pictures that didn't really reflect an accurate 3D orientation of the power supply during installation; no words, no mention of the power connections to existing components or the motherboard.
If you've never swapped out components in a desktop before, you might think twice about this simply due to the poor instructions. If you know what you're doing, its no big deal, and a great upgrade for low cost.

..

35853342 This power supply is so quiet and is great. its super fast too

Built with quality components and dual +12V outputs, the Elite series is fit to handle demands of high power requirements. The eco-friendly design allows the Elite series to reach more than 70% efficiency at typical loading and meet Energy Star and Blue Angel requirements.


..

35853342 All the different power connections will be great for expansion. four SATA connections made it easy to connect the power to my four drives.
It was the easier install getting the power supply into the case (no pushing or grunting). I've never had a quieter machine. When I first hit the power switch I wondered if was going. Best value for the price.

..

35853342 I purchased this unit around a year ago to upgrade my pre-built PC for gaming
It runs really great since then! highly recommended for this price.

..

35853342 All I really wanted was something to get my dead PC back up and running. I have virtually no computer building experience and have never changed a power supply in the past. This is a pretty simple replacement. If you have little experience, I would suggest moving slowly - unplug one thing at a time or somehow mark each cord you take off. The various connections are pretty "idiot proof" - it would be difficult to reverse the direction of a plug, etc. As careful as I was, it took less than a half hour and I am back up and running about a month ago - no problems, runs quiet. Hopefully it will run for many years to come! If it fails, I will be sure to update this posting.

..

35853342 Good, inexpensive power supply. Has been dependable.

..

35853342 I needed a bit more power supply for my new video card. There were no complications regarding installation with basic knowledge. This box is the size of a game cube and very quite. No problems at all so far, I've had it for a little under two months.

..

35853342 This is my third power supply. This was the easiest to install, plus great price. The item shipped quickly. No issues so far with this ps. I give it great ratings.

35853342 I specifically asked the salesgirl for a power supply with 1 x 24 pin and 2 x 8 pin motherboard connectors. She told me this model had them. She was wrong.

..

35853342 Got my dead PC back up and running again for cheap money. The price was more than some other sites, but when you factored in the shipping it was a wash, and I recieved it in 3 days, other site stated 7-10 days. So in the end, this was a good deal. I only wish they whould have stocked this in the local store for same day pick up. They only stock the more expensive units, costing twice as much in the stores.

..

35853342 It works as it should has enough connects for me,I love it I would buy more but don't need to. I almost broke it the first day i got it but if it was not for the power supply's surge protector my whole computer would have been done. It is a really good power supply.

Cooler Master's HAF 912 further enriches the HAF series by adding a compact, yet fully featured, mid-tower solution for enthusiasts and budget conscious gamers alike. Its seemingly small exterior supports a plethora of interior features such as twelve devices, high end GPU cards like the ATI Radeon HD 5970 and the NVIDIA GTX 480, large CPU coolers, two 200mm fans, and six 120mm fans.The HAF 912 embodies the rugged aesthetic and qualities of its brethren while remaining attractively priced. Its traits more closely resemble that of a mid to high-end case than that of other cases in its price range. The HAF 912 pays tribute to the legacy of HAF 932 & HAF 922 in ease of installation, high airflow, and compatibility with water cooling hardware.


..

35853342 Overall this case is great! It isn't a full tower, but it fits the length of my Radeon HD 7950 video card in it. I'm also able to fit my Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo on the CPU.
Airflow is great if you utilize most of the fan areas, but if you rely on fans for cooling, as opposed to water cooler, etc., then the case will get dusty pretty quickly. There are ways to maximize airflow while trying to keep as much dust out as possible (refer to the Cooler Master Website).

..

35853342 bought this case to upgrade my old case, very spacious, fits all components, able to put a lot of fans.

..

35853342 Plenty of hardware and space I have no complaints. I had to order an extension for my power supply but nothing is perfect I like the power supply on the bottom

..

35853342 I love this case cable management is a breeze plenty of airflow especially where I live lots of room to modify further very user friendly. The case is a little bulky and heavy. thanks cooler master God Bless.

..

35853342 This is the first tower that I've ever bought for myself, and I have to say, for the price, it's a great case that will last a long time. It's got sturdy construction, and it's pretty roomy inside.

..

35853342 Real good value for a simple tower. Fans could run little faster.

..

35853342 Overall this product works great for what I had in mind. There is a ton of space inside for plenty of cards a few dvd/cd trays (or something of similar size) as well as a few hard drives.
the only big con I had for this tower was it was a bit overkill for the amount of stuff I planned on installing but thats fine because room to upgrade is always welcome.

..

35853342 i picked up this case for a new build for 50 bucks. similar cases in this pricepoint cannot match its features. it has full cable management, water cooling supports and great airflow. heres the pros and cons on this case
Pros:
full cable management
cheap
great airflow with alot of places for fans
watercooling support for dual 120mm radiators
removable hdd cage for better airflow
Cons:
behind the motherboard can get a bit tight with all the cables, there should be some more allocated room (make sure to use the zipties the case comes with
looks, some may think that it looks juvenile or silly but for 50 bucks, why not
i reccomend this case specifically for budget minded builders. a better all rounder case for general use would be the corsair 300r/400r but those are 80-100 bucks
i would definitely buy this again for a build if i had to

..

35853342 This is a really nice case, has good wiring management, easy access, has air filters for the bottom mount power supply and the front grille pops off nicely for maintenance cleaning. Has room for a third party heatsink. I have a Hyper 212+ in this one. Has the space for a 10"+ video card. I use a GTX 560 in this case
The bad:
This case only came with one 120mm fan in the front and one in the back. It has a top grille for a massive 200mm fan on the top and it really needs a fan there so count on adding about $20. or so for that too. It should also have a second 120mm fan in the front (you can fit 2-120mm fans or one 200mm fan in the front) So other than lacking all the fans that you would want, this is a great case! Just plan on spending more for the missing fans

The much anticipated HAF X arrives as the flagship of the popular HAF (High Air Flow) series. Designed for performance systems, this chassis is able to house today's latest and hottest CPUs, motherboards, graphics cards and is even compatible with USB 3.0 devices. With specialized support and cooling for graphic cards, massive airflow with the help of up to four gigantic fans and easy access to installed components, this as close as it gets to a system builder's 'dream case'.


..

35853342 This is my second rig I have build and one the most satisfying thing I got from this one was the space for my parts and the cable management. It does not look as sleek as others, but it gets the job done and I am very happy with the purchase

..

35853342 There is nothing I don't love about this case. It's roomy, which makes it very easy to add components, has great cable management features, hard drive and CD-ROM drive installation was a breeze, and has lots of fans to move air around, with the added benefit of being able to add even more to the case if you feel so inclined.
This case replaced an old bare-bones case that I used for a couple of years. Temps are lower on both my CPU and video card and that makes me very happy. Besides all that, the thing just looks cool! Is the red LED on the front fan a little overkill? Sure, but who cares because it looks like a Cylon. A cool, old-school Cylon.
If I had to toss in a downside, it's the manual. If I didn't know what I was doing already, the manual would have frustrated me to no end. It's a multilingual, poorly-worded, picture-based booklet that would do no favors to someone building a PC for the first time.
OK, one more small downside: I did think at $189, it was a bit pricey and to be honest, if I hadn't been able to use some gift cards to get it at a greatly reduced price, I likely wouldn't have bought it. Having said that, it is nice to have a roomy case with lots of air circulation and plenty of room to expand. If you do decide to drop the money and get this case, you won't regret it.

..

35853342 I bought this because my past system was getting too hot.
After 3 days case was at my house fast shipping,i knew that case will be big but this thing is huge it wont fit under my desk.
Cable management is superb this is my second Cooler Master case and ill buy again in the future

..

35853342 great compatability, keeps all components cool, plenty of room

..

35853342 This is, in my opinion, a perfectly designed computer case. It looks nice, it has ample room for just about any sort of build you can imagine, it has great wire management features, and the fans that come with it are pretty good as well.
The built-in fans run quiet, and the case really helps keep everything cool. USB 3.0 built-in and a hot swap bay, and it's fantastic. Would definitely recommend!

..

35853342 Cable management is easily the best out of any other case. They include plenty of cable management holes and places to secure the cables with cable ties. The right side panel is extruded so you can fit more cables behind the motherboard tray. They also include a box which can hide cables at the bottom.

..

35853342 this case does a great job pulling out the heat and keeping insides cool

..

35853342 This case is wonderful. It gave me plenty of room to run the wires behind the motherboard for all of my drive bays along with for the motherboard itself. It has plenty of space for pretty much any upgrade to a computer that you can think of.
The case will work for Full ATX, Micro ATX, and even Mini ATX boards.

..

35853342 I bought this case a while back and fully built my computer early this month around August 9th. This case is very spacious for current builds and future expansion. I highly recommend this case for anyone who wants to upgrade their rig or build their own custom computer.
Pros:
The case is mainly made of steel/plastic (which you will notice is pretty heavy with nothing in it) but it will give you the piece of mind that it has durable material that will not break easily. This motherboard can support up to an Extended ATX motherboard and can the largest of video cards which is amazing. It has excellent air cooling to boot with one front 230mm red led fan, two 200mm fans (one optional) and a 140mm rear fan. The case is also liquid cooling ready. I installed the optional 200mm fan on the top and even with a full load my computer doesn't pass 42C-44C and it's whisper quiet. The HDD slots include a caddy that snaps onto your 3.5" drives and it also includes two bays that can install 2.5" drives. In the front, there are also four bays that you can install 5.25" drives or something else and there are two hot-swappable bays that you can install an extra hard drive if necessary.
It comes stocked with a bunch of extras depending on how you are going to use it (i.e. VGA card air duct, GPU card holder, wheels if a hard floor, standoffs, a built in power supply cable partition which will help you achieve that clean installation look, and a bunch of extras like cable ties and such).
Cons:
This case is superb so my only cons are some minor things that I think Cooler Master could have improved on. One of my only major gripes is that yes it comes with a CPU cooler cutout on the motherboard tray however, it's not as big as you need it to be. I had to uninstall my motherboard to install the CPU cooler bracket THEN install the CPU cooler bracket which defeats the purpose if it features a cutout in the back.
The other very minor gripe with the case that some consumers may disagree with me on the case if very expensive right off the bat but I believe they should at least include the optional 200mm fan. But I like said some consumers may disagree with me because some may use that unoccupied vent for something else such as liquid cooling (360mm radiator).
Final Thoughts:
This case is excellent for you are paying for. I originally paid $199.99 but the price has dropped which makes this case more affordable. This case is one of the best on the market right now in my opinion and if you look across other retailers it has some excellent reviews.

The Notepal LapAir is a simple and elegant solution to a problem that has existed since the mass production of laptops. That is, finding a comfortable way to use a laptop away from a desk without it overheating or burning the user. A laptop cooler and a cushion have come together to create the perfect away from the office companion. It allows users to work on their laptop anywhere they can find a seat or lay down. The LapAir becomes an ergonomic surface for viewing and typing while resting on a users lap. Cooler Master understands that comfort is paramount in these situations and the Notepal LapAir is engineered to deliver.

Powered by USB port extender, you won't lose a USB port   Cable grooves for easy USB cable management.   Supports up to 17" laptops.  


..

35853342 I am so glad I picked this. It is so comfy on my lap. Its the only one I have found that has a cushion on the bottom. Keeps the laptop cool.
The only thing is that computer measures 16 inches so it sits on top of it, A smaller laptop will fit in the slot it has. You do have to be careful cause it will move a little.

..

35853342 This product is great for my Asus computer, not for my mac. My mac slides all over this thing which is annoying when I'm in bed and trying to do work on my computer. My Asus computer though has more grip to the bottom of the unit which allows for it to not slide all over the pad. It works great for my Asus and does its job well. Comfortable, reliable, and does its job as you'd expect. Just doesn't mesh well with a Mac as I mentioned before. Overall, great product for non-Mac computers.

..

35853342 I own a Lenovo y580 laptop, which runs an i7 and an Nvidia GTX 660. Needless to say, whenever I try to play games like Crysis or even Star Wars Battlefront 2, it will heat up to the point of shutting down. This cooler pad is a miracle worker for my laptop. If starting the game with it on, temperatures never surpass mid-level operating range. If I turn it on mid game, temperatures settle within 2-3 minutes to mid-level operating range. It's simply amazing how well and quickly it works! The blower fan is only slightly louder than expected (which other reviews also note) but since it is a monotonous sound it very quickly fades out of conscious hearing. I use the pad almost all the time that my computer is on and only notice it after I turn the computer off and it gets quiet. It's perfect for lap sitting, in bed or something like that, and it works perfectly well on a desk too. This was exactly what I needed, and it was less expensive than other varieties out there.

..

35853342 cooler master is a great product for a good price. I am 18 and am located in mesa, arizona. It reaches around 110 degrees here and with the cooler master I can make sure my asus x75a ds51 stays nice and cool whether I am gaming, using google, managing my etsy account, and much more. I recommend the cooler master.

Vortex Plus is a low profile CPU cooler with compact size but uncompromising cooling efficiency. The compact feature best suits in HTPC chassis or chassis with slim width and limited space. The heatsink comes with 4 heatpipes and direct contact base to maximize the heat conductivity and dissipation efficiency. The balanced PWM fan works to provide high airflow under high RPM mode.


..

35853342 Got this to replace a stock Intel fan that came with my CPU. The stock fan was not keeping the CPU cool, I had temps in the high 70's most of the time. After removing the stock fan I cleaned the CPU with some alcohol and installed this new fan. My average temp is about 50 now. This is doing a much better job at keeping my PC running cooler. Plus, it just looks so cool with the heat pipes coming out the side!

..

35853342 I needed a new heat sink and fan because the mounts to my former one broke when I took it out of the old MB, so I needed a new one for my new MB. I found few heat sinks that would accommodate a 1366 chip. My research indicated that the Cooler Master Vortex fit the bill. The unit is small enough to fit in my mini-ATX Rampage III Gene MB which I installed in a new Rosewell case. Instructions are fair but not complete enough for a first install. Someone who has done this a few times will have no problem. It comes with thermal paste which was great. My problem was with the plastic mounts. Three of the four went on great, but that last one of course would not want to secure tightly. For someone good at this, installation will likely not be a problem. Be patient with yourself if this is your first heat sink install.
As for performance, I am very happy. I was running 38 to 45 C temps with my old factory installed heat sink, not bad for a 1366 I-7 chip. The Cooler Master Vortex Plus does better with boot temps as cool as 25 C and generally runs in mid to high 30's C when I am doing simple computer activities. I have to work the computer to get it up to mid 40's. Video work will do that. The Vortex definitely keeps my CPU cooler than my old one. I am not a gamer so I cannot address that situation, but it should work well even with that heavy use. After several weeks of use I am still happy with the Cooler Master Vortex Plus heat sink.

..

35853342 The Cooler Master - Vortex Plus 92mm CPU Cooling Fan with Heat Sink is a good inexpensive heat sink cooler. It works so well that I can't even hear the CPU fan.
My only gripe about the heat sink is that it is a pain to install. Instructions are vague and the heat sink is very bulky. Before purchasing make sure that the heat sink can actually fit in your PC!!!

Pro is the fastest and easiest upgrade to THX TruStudio Pro audio technology.


..

35853342 I replaced my old Dell desk top with a new Dell small tower model.
The sound card was not so great in the new one. The in-store Geek squad searched the shelves for an external sound card that plugs into a USB port. This one was clearly a great improvement.

..

35853342 I needed a easy solution to my headphone jack not work and this did the trick.

..

35853342 EFFECTIVE, QUICK, EXTERNAL FIX TO AUDIO CARD PROBLEM.

..

35853342 If you have a computer with a suspect sound quality, this by far is the best solution. The sound is great. It definitely was a "Best Buy"

..

35853342 Had my Logitech computer speakers w/subwoofer punching some great rock for the size, but as usual, I wanted more. I Googled and found what I needed. This little package of dynamite absolutely turned my speakers into ear and mind crushing levels so much so that I can't go but 60% power level!! I'm afraid I'll blow them if I push them. bottom line, it's a slam dunk and no-brainer!!

..

35853342 I bought this because the audio and microphone hook-ups on my laptop were not functioning very well with my headset. So, this sound card has fixed the problem very easily, and the sound quality is great.

..

35853342 I'm happy plugged it in and away I went. Decent sound clarity for the basic games that I play.

..

35853342 I needed an easy was to connect a headset to my computer for use with Dragon Naturally Speaking. This was perfect for it.

..

35853342 i had to purchase this for my job, as I have to wear headphones and lost sound on my computer. This was an inexpensive, easy fix to my problem. Just plugged it into a USB port, and it was ready to go!

..

35853342 It works on Windows 8 just by plugging it in, no drivers needed! My new laptop has horrible sound quality, so knowing that Creative Sound Blaster makes a USB solution is awesome!

Crucial 240-pin DIMMs are used in DDR3 memory for desktop computers. DDR3 is the latest generation of memory with an improved architecture that allows it to transmit data more quickly.A dual inline memory module (DIMM) consists of a number of memory components (usually black) that are attached to a printed circuit board (usually green). The gold pins on the bottom of the DIMM provide a connection between the module and a socket on a larger printed circuit board. The pins on the front and back of a DIMM are not connected to each other.


..

35853342 Purchased RAM for iMac even though this says it is for laptop. Works as advertised for the iMac and great bargain for the price.

..

35853342 I'm not saying this wasn't a good product but it would not work in my Dell Vostro 230 even though the Memory Finder said it should. To be fair, I don't know if it was the memory or the machine that was the issue. Best Buy was great on their support and providing me with a refund.

..

35853342 Works good. It was easy to set up, and the small size make it a good fit.

..

35853342 would recommend it to anyone . It's easy to install and use

..

35853342 I bought 3 of these hoping to prevent using wires. These adapters seem to work well on newer PC's. On a older Dell Dimension pc, the dlink software would never recognize the adapter. Windows XP would recognize the adapter fine but it would never connect to the router. I am using a Cisco Wireless N router. I installed one on another older Dell Dimension and it worked fine until the reboot. After the reboot the dlink software would not load and the adapter would constantly connect and disconnect. 2 out of the 3 adapters were a disappointment. The environment had a security camera. However, the phones in use were 6 Ghz and work fine. I felt that these adapters would work well also. But not so.

..

35853342 Used with linksys N router, which gives my desktop computer N speed. Wanted to use this on my laptop, and only got half the speed advertised, which was 65 mpbs vs. 130 mpbs on my desktop using a linksys adapter.

35853342 it is great love it would recommend to my friends and family. I really love it.

..

35853342 The signal can come and go several time in the same day. However, we can be on our laptops right next to the computer and never loose our wireless signal. Becomes a real pain when you have a child trying to finish a research project or online test.

..

35853342 I bought this USB network card, it was a breeze to install on my Windows 7 PC, works great with Windows XP as well as I tried it on my laptop which runs XP.

35853342 Had decided to move desktop to another room so purchased this. It worked just fine. Reception was strong. However decided to move desktop back downstairs and returned it.

..

35853342 I absolutely love this tablet. I find this device fills the gap between my smartphone and desktop and eliminating my need for a laptop. I also own an Android tablet that is relegated to rare usage since I bought this tablet.
I don't see anything else in the marketplace that comes close to the bang for the buck of this device. While I recognize that it may not be the perfect device for everyone, it definitely deserves a close look for anyone in the market for a tablet.

..

35853342 As soon as I powered this on, and checked for updates, there were plenty. It shipped with Windows 8, but updated easily to 8.1 . After a couple of months of happy, more-rather-than-less satisifed ownership, an automatic Windows update caused the machine to no longer wake from sleep. I would have to hold down the power button for 10 seconds to power it off, then hit the power button again to boot up fresh. VERY annoying, especially for a tablet that gets put to sleep and woken up very often. I was able to fix this symptom by uninstalling KB 2883200 and KB 2887595 (found this suggested fix on the Dell forums), then doing a Refresh (a new Windows 8 feature). Unfortunately, my Windows Home Server 2011 isn't backing up any of my Windows 8 machines, but that's another problem. I don't know if the Refresh fixed the no wake from sleep problem, or a combination of uninstalling the aforementioned hot-fixes, but now the machine seems to be working fine, again. I had to deactivate automatic updates, and it's somewhat of a nuisance to review each update that's offered, but it's so convenient to carry around a small full-blown Windows experience machine in a smallish camera bag.

..

35853342 Great tablet for the money. Reasonably fast and the 64 GB version has enough space for additional apps and programs. Adding an additional micro memory card is easy. You can modify Windows 8.1 so that you can get the look and feel of Windows 7 including the Start menu. Using a stylus is very helpful if you have big fingers.

..

35853342 This is great for what I use it for: email, web. Have yet to really try to use office. This is also my first experience with Windows 8 and it's a huge learning curve. Have some issues selecting buttons on some websites - don't know if this is my fault or the incompatibility of the site. Not sure the battery life is that great, but I'm can only compare to iPad in the tablet realm.

..

35853342 It's a great Windows 8.1 machine and is a good 'computer on the road'. I appreciate it's usefulness as a portable device.

..

35853342 I bought this tablet because it had Windows OS...it has Windows 8 which is something I'm getting used to. The tablet is powerful and the battery life is awesome! The touch response could be better, but the use of a stylus helps to solve that issue.

..

35853342 The Venue 8 is an excellent device in a handy 8" format.
Easy to setup and as it comes with full Windows 8.1 I also use full MS Office. Through the micro USB you can connect a USB flash or a mobile dongle. Bluetooth can connect keyboard/mouse.
Another great feature is the default Win8 cordless screen connector.
Graphifs and sound is great.
Battery time great.

..

35853342 Windows 8.1 has come to an excellent tablet! Having been involved with computers for decades, I am happy to have found this Dell Windows tablet. It performs wonderfully on every Windows application from games to business software. I would highly advise that you get the 64gb since the OS takes a chunk of your available memory. I would also suggest popping a 64gb micro-SD card in the slot for additional storage. I have tried the Acer Icona, and a number of 10-inch Windows tablets and find this one the most powerful and, obviously, compact. Light as a feather yet a serious computer, the Dell gets my highest marks in the Windows 8 category. I will warn you that, as is true with all tablets, the screen is small. If your eyes are sharp or you have some good reading glasses, you will be fine. As always, I recommend that you give it a try and if it is not for you, simply return it to Best Buy within the allotted time period. I am keeping mine and delighted to now have the full power of a Windows 8.1 computer in my pocket!

Keep your little one entertained with this Ematic FunTab Pro tablet that features built-in Wi-Fi for fast and easy access to the Web. The 8GB storage capacity provides plenty of space for music, movies, photos and more.


..

35853342 It seems good so far, but we still have not delved in depth to the parent website. It would probably be easier if you could do everything as a parent from the device and just had a different password so the child could not get on the parent side.

..

35853342 Stopped charging after 2-3weeks if having it. Ordered on-line but went to return to store. Was told that after 2 weeks it needs to be taken up with the manufacturer. What??!? The slip in the package that came with it had a short paragraph in regards to returns but not the complete return policy. The slip was also bout 3 feet long with lots if blank space to write the entire return policy. Needless to say I was very disappointed. But the manager at the nearby best buy did agree to take it back and gave me a store credit. After a little research online (should have done prior to purchase) I saw that other customers could not charge their tablet after even a few days. After this experience with Ematic product I would not buy anything from them again. Also very disappointed in Best Buy for not including the complete return policy on the 3 foot long slip sent with product. Greatful for the manager who was great with customer service.

..

35853342 Great product for the price great for small children and the programs are educational. My granddaughter is 7 and feels like she has an adult tablet.

..

35853342 I bought this for my son for Christmas and he has been in love with it ever since. We use it for learning and also as a reward system. An added benefit is the fact that we can keep in touch with family members that don't live close via the V-Mail feature.
I would recommend this as an alternative for an iPad or Kindle because it is similar in nature, but a kid version since it might get dropped.

..

35853342 I bought this for my 4 year old for christmas. She LOVES it. I was tired of her stealing her sisters kindle fire. This is great. It has games like angry birds and cut the rope but LOTS of other educational games and I don't have to worry about her playing stuff not appropriate. She loves that she can send video messages to our family and her friends. The storybook feature is great too. She took it in and showed her teacher and she liked it so much she asked her to bring it in to show the class. My 7 & 9 year old also have their own settings on it and both love to play it. I have not had any charging issues like the other person maybe they just got a defective one. I also love the emails telling me about her progress. Its a great tablet for kids that you don't have to worry about what is being played because you are in complete control. The only downfall is when we are out and about we have found that some games only play on wifi but with that being said all my daughters favorites still played without so its not that detrimental to her not to have those few games. That is why I would give it 4 out of 5 stars

..

35853342 I brought this tablet for my 9 yr old son because I didn't want him to have an adult tablet and the fun tab pro grow with age. This was a horrible mistake! It was easy to set up; my son fell in love right away with the tablet. On the third day it would not charge. My husband and I tried charging the tablet for 2 days still it would not charge. I return it to the nearest Bestbuy; the customer service was Great! I will not buy any Ematic product. Now I have to try and find reasonable price tablet for my son that works. Should have followed my instincts and not brought the tablet.

Awesome features at an incredible value - the EVGA GeForce 8400 GS graphics card delivers. Essential for watching HD DVD and Blu-ray movies on a PC, accelerating the Microsoft Windows Vista/7 experience, and powering Microsoft DirectX 9 and DirectX 10 games.


..

35853342 This graphics card is loud. Annoying if you live in a quiet environment. Was not able to return to Bestbuy, they only accept 15 days after purchase. Also it is not compatible with Windows 8.

..

35853342 We are setting up dual monitor support for a lot of our users. These cards for performance and cost are great. I can send a card out to a site and someone with no tech skill whatsoever can put them in the pc. Drop the cd in the drive and install the software. They have more issues with figuring out the "blue connector or the white connector goes to where"

..

35853342 I bought this card for gaming. And to buy one on a low budget but your better off spending some more money on a better video card.

..

35853342 I do a lot of video editing for my work. Having just the standard card built into my system board, which was pretty decent when I purchased it, I thought I could improve my video quality by adding a new video card.
The GeForce product line is inexpensive, since I will be getting a newer computer within the year, I didn't want to spend a lot of money. I was hoping to get a 1 gig card, but the 6200 at 512MB was a big improvement to my current card.
If you haven't even installed a video card, they can be simple or tricky. My personal system is pretty tight on space, so the card just barely fit. Once installed it was easy to continue the setup and it has worked just fine.
The Biggest Problem was ordering through BestBuy.com I needed a PCI card for my system, so in doing so I used their search window and thought but clicking on the PCI button I would only be getting PCI results. Not so, it also included PCI-Express results and that lead to me ordering the wrong product, getting it and having to return it and re-order then wait another 10 days for it to arrive.
It also offers Open GL2.0, but is not Open CL compatible as some of their newer cards are.
Other minor problem I have noticed is some slight buzz through my speakers when scrolling on a web page. Not sure if this is connected to the card, but wasn't happening before the install. Also, since this does have more memory, after first installing there was a very distinct plastic odor coming from the PC. It went away after a few hours, but was sort of scary to think my computer was about to go up in flames from just a new video card install.
Skip this model if you can afford a newer one, but for what it is, it does work as expected.

..

35853342 the expression is "what you pay for is what you get for"

..

35853342 This was the first upgrade for me and I didn't know how to put it in the pc so it would be nice to have instructions. Once I restarted the pc it was already installed, which was nice since I'm a newbie.

..

35853342 This product was very inexpensive. It allows you to watch HD videos without all the cutting frames and very fluid. It was easy to install and simple instructions.

..

35853342 Replaced an old, much more expensive card that was constantly crashing my computer, multiple times per day. Since I've installed this card, the graphics have looked much better and my computer has been up for over 9 days so far. The installation was simple and the included software is interesting if you want to play around with overclocking.
Extremely good value considering this only cost $30.

..

35853342 Worked right out of the box. No fuss with drivers.

..

35853342 The Geforce 8400 is a great card for upgrading a standard office computer to allow for multiple monitors.
The installation was quick and after software installation was complete, I was enjoying dual monitors shortly thereafter.
No noticable noise. I run various office software with no major rendering or video needs so i've yet to push this card to its limits. For $40 bucks, its a easy fit.
Worked just fine with Windows 7 64bit OS

35853342 I bought this for my kids to play minecraft on the desktop and for under $40, it's the best deal I got. Couldn't even find that at the Best Buy store. So bestbuy.com was the way to go.

..

35853342 This product was very easy to install and set up. Works great with games that required a better graphic card than what came with my computer. Great value

..

35853342 I like the card very much. It is very easy to install. It is great for office or home use.

..

35853342 The GeForce 210 video card I bought was a replacement for the GeForce card I had for 5 years, which was top of the line when it was purchased. I have approximately the same framerate with this card even though it only cost around 40 dollars. This card will allow you to play current online titles without worry about compatibility issues. If you prefer competitive play, i.e. player-vs.-player, you will probably want to spend a little more. I am extremely happy with this product.

35853342 Doa straight out of the box. Called to return, Buy.com asked if I wanted a refund or a replacement. I chose refund. No reviews here on BestBuy.com but other website reviews state this story doa or died after a week. EVGA is not worth the aggravation. My opinion is stick to a trusted brand. I wish I did. Price is good for a 80% psu but not worth the possibilities of dealing with a DUD.

35853342 I no longer have to use my computer to crank out multiple DVDs. I have yet to try it on CDs.

..

35853342 This is a good product. it works well and i have had no problems with it.

..

35853342 Well, I ordered this for my school Library and I did enjoy the price and the fact that it was not necessary to have a computer to duplicate. I used it immediately to copy numerous photo CDs from our school play and it worked fabulously for the first 20 copies. After that, the machine began grinding and making a horrid noise. About every third CD I put in would come back with an error as well. I decided to return it and get a new one. I now have my new machine and so far it has done well; however, I have not had to duplicate more than 5 CDs at a time so I am crossing my fingers that I don't have any further issues when we do more bulk CDs.

..

35853342 This is a great product for the bucks. Works great. I hughly recommend it.

..

35853342 I purchased this camera for a Junior High Yearbook staff to use. It takes amazing pictures. Very rarely do they blur. If they do blur it's usually our fault. I'm so impressed with this camera I'm ordering one for my husband for his personal use. It is a bit expensive but it's definitely worth the cost. I usually use Canon and Nikon but I must say Fuji has produced an awesome product and I don't regret the extra cost. In my opinion it was worth it. Small camera great pictures!

..

35853342 I love how easy it is use. Also the grahpics are great. Easy to see and hear directions. I also love it warns you about your speed.

..

35853342 Decent GPS. We use it occasionally, mostly for long trips. Easy to use and store. Lifetime maps was my main concern.

..

35853342 This is a great GPS unit. Very easy to use. Speaks road names and addresses.

..

35853342 Bought this for my father who is 82 and was asking for a GPS...couldn't have been a better gift for him. He did need help updating the maps, but only because he doesn't really use computers. If I had to do it all over again, I would not hesitate to buy something refurbished.

..

35853342 This is the 3rd gamin I have purchased and I have liked all of them. I bought this one because the price was right and it had lifetime maps. Can't get much better than that

..

35853342 This is the second Garmin that I have owned. Now I have one for both cars. Super easy to set up, easy and intuitive to use, good features, easy to read, durable and reasonably accurate. I love the lifetime updates!
I would recommend this unit to anyone who travels alot! Well worth it!

..

35853342 I never thought I would want one of these but since I have had it, I spend less time looking and get right to my destination. Enter the address and get step by step directions to get where you are going, it don't get any easier than that.

..

35853342 Garmin maps are always clear and the directions/instructions are easy to follow! I would not use any other software.

..

35853342 I thought it said I'd be able to see the list of albums so I could get to the album I wanted, but you have to scroll to the one you want. That's the only irritating thing!
I bought this for my granddaughter so that I could play "sleepy time" music in her room as she's falling asleep. I hooked it to some small speakers and it does the trick.

Listen to your favorite songs with this GPX PC332B portable CD player that features 60-second antiskip protection for reliable performance and 20 programmable tracks for easy customization. The built-in FM radio lets you enjoy a variety of stations.


..

35853342 When I plugged the headphones in, the sound kept turning off. I could see the CD spinning, but no sound. Tried different head phones. Same results. Apparently bad headphone connection. So I returned the CD player. Best Buy was wonderful about accepting the return and crediting my account.

..

35853342 pretty good over all.given As a gift to my niece as christmas gift and
she says she likes it, buy the vocer is a bit flimsy and really glad I took
out the extended warranty.

..

35853342 for some reason it won't play the cds i burned myself , the radio gets poor reception , and it won't work with rechargeable batteries , but it is great playing store bought cds ,i use it for when i do kidney dialsis

35853342 I know cd players are old school, but this is perfect for my girlfriend on her long road trips.

The Grace Wi-Fi Tuner provides digital audio direct from the internet to your home stereo. Listen to your personal music collection, over 30,000 internet radio stations, podcast and on demand Wi-Fi radio content or online music services like Pandora, Live365, and SIRIUS.


..

35853342 I have a very good wireless router but the radio captured just a few radio stations .... until I decided to run an ethernet cable .... then I was very pleased .

..

35853342 Forget about AM/FM/HD and satellite radio as this is the wave of the future. I bought this internet radio tuner and hooked it up to the stereo, setup the network connection in a few minutes and with the station lists automatically downloaded from the grace.reciva website, wow station after station to listen to. If you like music that isn't played on broadcast radio or satellite anymore, this is what you need to listen to tunes you actually like at home with quality sound on your stereo system. Stop listening to internet radio streams on your computer, and spending time trying to find stations to add to your media player as grace has done all the hard work for you and has 17,000+ in their database right now and is continually adding more. You can also add (up to a 100?) internet stations or music streams of your own choosing via an online account after registering the product. After turning the tuner off/on, theyre then available in a menu item called My Stuff. This tuner also has several other features and ways to listen to music, but I haven't even tried those having had too much enjoyment playing new found stations. I've used it for over 100 hours with no problems and liked it so much I bought another from Best Buy.

..

35853342 Is a great asset to my music system.
Have listened to music from all over the world.
Quality is excellent . No fading in and out ,reception is fantastic. I would recommend this to anyone who is a music buff . Hook it up to your stereo , tv , any thing with an input jack. or u can use digital inputs or optical cable. It has everything. Easy to hookup and set up, easy to read display.
You will love it and be shocked on what it can do.

..

35853342 Overall nice unit, works well. Do not know what else to say about the unit.

..

35853342 I was looking for an internet radio that I could hook up to my stereo system. I wanted one that was not complicated to use and sounded good as well. This tuner was both simple to setup and use and sounds good. Makes good connection with the router and maintains it.

Burn your entire album to CD, convert your songs to MP3 for use on your iPod, and add all your recorded files to your computer's music library.


..

35853342 My brothers and I bought this for my dad for Christmas this year. He wanted to start listening to some of his old "vinyl". We gave it to him Christmas Eve. He loves it. We listened to old records into the early morning. Easy to operate. The sound quality is quite remarkable for the price even with the volume turned up. So glad we found this for him. Now my brother and sister-in-law are going to buy one.

..

35853342 This is a piece of junk. The albums played kind of but not great. The 45's sounded weird. The CD player is a piece of junk. The CD's kept slipping off the tray. Finally one wouldn't come out. I had to close and open it 3 times to get the CD out which was brand new Christmas CD. It came out all scratched. I returned this turn table and bought a Crosley for almost 1/2 the price and it works so much better. It is also built a lot better.

..

35853342 I have two complaints; it was advertised as being "brown"; the picture on the website showed it to be a light, reddish-brown, but it still would fit in with my other furniture. However, when I opened the box, the unit was a strong, red brick color, and doesn't really go with my furniture. I've made an adjustment to offset the color difference, mainly because I didn't want to return it. It's what I've been looking for. I believe that the picture on the internet should represent all aspects of the unit, including the color. It was also advertised as having an automatic return arm--it doesn't. You have to lift a small lever on the side of the arm to change the record. Again, not advertised well. I don't think I will purchase online from Best Buy again.

..

35853342 I got this for my husband for Christmas and its great I expected it to be made of really cheap material but it's actually really sturdy and strong. Also the needle on the record player picks up when the record is over to prevent scratching. (I also knew it didn't have an iPod dock when I bought it its just the one flaw it has to me)

..

35853342 I have a number of Graces internet radios and always thought them to be a good value however this item however is pure junk.

Smart-UPS 1500VA Tower UPS, trusted to protect critical data and equipment from power problems by supplying clean and reliable network-grade power. In addition to legendary reliability and manageability, Smart-UPS 1500VA Tower UPS have extremely high efficiency at low, medium and high load levels making it an ideal for today's multi-core or virtualized servers that have varying load consumption.


..

35853342 I bought this UPS proactively as a replacement to my 11 year old APC UPS (which served me well). Its older brother has been reliable (even though our power company isn't) and I have no reason to doubt the reliability of this one. Before purchasing I received great support from APC and was able to find up-to-date software, even for Server 2012 and Windows 8.
The unit is a breeze to set up and its user interface is visually appealing and provides a lot of features, for example, power usage monitoring (KWh and VA), voltage, load, and outage history (in graph or table form). I really like how the banks of outlets can be assigned different priorities, i.e., some can shut down right away while others can be directed to stay on as long as possible in case of an outage. The front-panel LCD is useful if you dont want to log on to access the UI (and can be used to configure UPS settings without logging on). Also, the UPS can also be accessed through/as a web page - for example, if you want to VPN remotely without doing a remote session.
Overall I have been extremely happy with APC, the reliability of their products, and their customer support. (FYI: connected to this unit are a Dell T620, Poweredge 2900, a couple of routers, switches, VoIP and WAN equipment, running at about 40% of the UPS' capacity).

..

35853342 The unit was fine once Best Buy replaced the unit that was damaged by UPS. Nothing less than you would expect from APC and Best Buy!

..

35853342 Overall I rate this a 4. It met and exceeded my expectations as far as rapidly charging my ipod and my iphone. Unfortunately, it didn't last the length of the warranty period but thankfully I purchased at Best Buy and had a copy of my receipt in my account. Hopefully a replacement will be on it's way soon!

..

35853342 It works perfect. I can listen to my i-pod in the car through the speakers. I love it.

..

35853342 The only thing I would change is the cable length. I wish it was longer so I could charge my phone and still be able to use it.

..

35853342 Took this to the beach and worked great for charging my 4th Gen Ipod!

..

35853342 Got this when daughters Apple cord would not charge her Iphone. It seems to have a more substantial cord. After ywo Apple cords, will see if this lasts longer.

..

35853342 This charger came with the new iPod I just purchased for my husband. Love it, it charges so much faster then the charger that comes with the apple products. Love it so much I bought my own that is able to be used in the car and in an outlet. Great purchase!

..

35853342 Good product. Small, compact, easy to use and not expensive.

..

35853342 I bought this as a my second charging unit for my iPad and Verizon iPhone 4 for work. Easy to use 2 piece powerblock 2.1amp that powers for iPad as good as the original apple charger. Powerblock comes with usb to apple port you can connect to powerblock or computer usb. It also charges and compatible with my iPhone 4 with no problem. The power has green led light with charging is use. Quick easy solution for secondary power unit or for travel.

..

35853342 The charger was at a great price and lives up to its description. At first I was skeptical about buying the product, but once I recieved it I was glad with my purchase. Its perfect to take on-the-go. It fits in your bag or your bookbag and it does not take up a lot of space.
Great Product! :)

Plug PowerJolt Plus into your cigarette lighter or 12V accessory socket and connect the coiled dock cable to your iPhone or iPod. While it's charging, PowerJolt Plus pops open to reveal another 12 volt socket, built right in.


..

35853342 I like this product because it works in the car. I bought it specifically to keep in case the battery life ran down while I was on the road.

..

35853342 Fuctional and sturdy Auto Charger for iPhones. Attractive with curly power cord and extra built in Aux Power Socket so you can still use the same cigarette power socket.

..

35853342 I thought it was a bit pricey. My old charger combo was starting to act up so I needed to replace it. I like the coiled cord and the fact the dock connector fits my iphone. My previous adapter I had to remove the case to charge it.
I haven't tried charging the iPad in the truck yet.
But so far so good , so thumbs up to Griffin

Ridiculously over-engineered? Or the perfect case for your iPad mini no matter where you're headed?We think it's a little bit of both.Tested and certified to meet or exceed US Department of Defense Standard 810F, Griffin's Survivor Military-Duty Case is designed from the inside out to protect your iPad mini from extreme conditions ... dirt, sand, rain, shock, vibration and a host of other environmental factors.Survivor is built on a shatter-resistant polycarbonate frame clad in rugged, shock absorbing silicone. A built-in screen protector seals your Multi-Touch display from the outside environment, while hinged plugs seal the dock connector, camera lens, headphone port, hold switch and volume controls. The included stand clips on, then folds open for landscape viewing and typing.


..

35853342 This was my original iPad mini case. I returned it the next day as it made the iPad too heavy, and the outside case was slimey to the touch

..

35853342 I have truly enjoyed the last two weeks with my new case. The color selection was exactly what I was looking for. I expected to pay more, but was pleasantly surprised. The case hugged the iPad mini very snug and tight. The screen protector allowed the the screen to still be sensitive to the lightest touches and gestures. To top it all off, there is a built in kick stand to support the device when watching a movie or reading, etc. I also remember there being a plug to cover the hole for the headphone jack and other parts. This served as a great way to keep dust and moisture out. Overall, a great case. You won't be disappointed. Unfortunately, it doesn't guard against theft. I lost my iPad Mini two weeks after I got the case. I never saw myself as wanting an iPad Mini since I have the iPhone and MacBook, but since it was a gift, I did enjoy it. Rest assured that when I buy another iPad Mini, I will also buy the exact same case. In the mean time, I'll miss you. May God have mercy on the evil person who stole it.

..

35853342 I got one of these and used it....heavily, like 7-8 time a day. One day I used it 3x in a row and it died.
I bought the same one again because it has a good look and no clock. As a basic coffee maker it makes good coffee!

..

35853342 Overall good product for the money, not sure how long it will last.

..

35853342 This is a great inexpensive coffee pot. Super simple to use, works quickly, nothing fancy to break or get in the way. You do have to make sure to click the lid down before you start it, but other than that, it is just a nice simple coffee maker.

35853342 I wanted a plain no frills maker. This was a replacement for my Mr, Coffee. I wanted a "V" #4 filter to make a good cup of coffee and this fills the bill. The basket lifts out, so you can empty the used filter without dripping all over the place. I bought 800 paper #4 filters for next to nothing and they work perfect in this. I use this every other day and give this Hamilton Beach a high rating.

35853342 I wanted a plain no frills maker. This was a replacement for my Mr, Coffee. I wanted a "V" #4 filter to make a good cup of coffee and this fills the bill. The basket lifts out, so you can empty the used filter without dripping all over the place. I bought 800 paper #4 filters for next to nothing and they work perfect in this. I use this every other day and give this Hamilton Beach a high rating.

This Hamilton Beach Durathon 19701 nonstick iron features a self-cleaning design and scratch-resistant exterior to ensure durability. The 3-way automatic shutoff feature allows safe use.


..

35853342 good product for iron I like the design of the iron.

..

35853342 Pretty good iron for the price, shot of steam really helps with stubborn wrinkles, sprayer should be located higher on iron so when you spray it doesn't go a foot in front of where you want to spray. It could get a little hotter.

..

35853342 i use it for occasional ironing of nice shirts. it does the job almost perfectly. the steam doesn't feel quite strong enough to get a wrinkle free shirt. but definitely worth it for the price.

Easily open pop-top and regular cans with this can opener that features an easy-touch opening lever and removable cutting assembly for a safe, easy-to-clean tool.


..

35853342 Bought this as a replacement for same model that finally wore out after years of use. Opens cans without leaving sharp edges.

..

35853342 I love the look and ease of this can opener. It is also much safer to use since it removes the whole top and does not have sharp edges to cut yourself with. I am very satisfied with this product.

..

35853342 Happy with our choice, seems sturdy and good value for price.

..

35853342 This is our first electric can opener, so I did some research. My last manual one was a dud, so we figured we'd jump into the big leagues. This one is great. It holds the can and opens it quickly. The only complaint is that it's a little loud, which makes my stealthy, early-morning lunch prep for the kids not so stealthy. Other than that, we love it. I'd buy another if it broke.

..

35853342 Opens all types of cans with ease. large or small even tall cans with no problems. opens lids without leaving a sharp edge.

..

35853342 Opens the cans from underneath so that there is no sharp edges to pull out or to pour from.

..

35853342 I purchased my first one and after setting it up I discovered the touch screen didn't work. Nice picture and all - just no touch function. Returned and waited a week for my replacement to show up. Yeah - the touch screen worked and once again a nice picture. Turned the screen off before going to bed. In the morning the monitor wouldn't turn on! So it lasted all of a few hours! Technical support at Hannspree isn't very good and their manual is a joke and is contradictory. In one spot says no drivers needed and in another says you need to install off the disk provided. Quality is VERY suspect. Avoid unless you can find in a local store.

..

35853342 Got this at a great price, it was on sale ( clearance item ) works well with recording game play, will use it for PS4 once the new firmware comes out to remove HDCP.

..

35853342 I bought the Hauppauge HD PVR 2 *Gaming Edition Plus* with high hopes. First off, this isn't the Gaming Edition Plus, but it is just the original HD PVR 2. The CD that came with the device wouldn't install despite the fact that my computer met all system requirements. Also, I had to buy component cables for my PlayStation because the device didn't come with any. For all aspiring YouTubers or if you just want to record epic gameplay, you would be better off buying an Elgato Capture HD. Save your money.....save the stress. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH A HAUPPAUGE.

..

35853342 Its fun to watch how you did in a scene. And to learn from your mistakes to improve on them

..

35853342 So far so good. I haven't used all the features yet, but what I have used has worked well and easily.

..

35853342 You no longer may receive the free HDPVR software for Mac with this edition of Happauge's gaming PVR. The box is still high-quality, but you must purchase the software for $30 if you are on Mac. Furthermore, PS3 recording is really poor in quality because it must be captured from component (not HDMI) and converted to a digital format, which results in diminished picture quality.

..

35853342 Is great price but the only bad thing that is doesn't have compatibility with the imac unless you buy another license so at the end you spend more money.

..

35853342 My son really enjoyed this for sharing gaming stats and screen shots. Seems to be doing all he expected and more.

..

35853342 Bought this product for my teenaged son who loves video editing and uploading videos to U-Tube. it took him a little while to learn how to use it but things are going good now.

..

35853342 shouldnt of even looked at this online worse purchase of my life so many things went wrong that i wouldnt advise anyone to go down this road and run as far away from this product as you can

..

35853342 it is a bit pricey but for what your getting its great. you don't use 5 wire components cables like the first one, now it hdmi

..

35853342 I'd like to give a glowing review, but that impossible. Charged the battery, but all this boat anchor will do is power up briefly then suddenly power off. Usually just the power light and WiFi/Mute buttons light, fan starts, the power shuts off while keyboard lights under the CapsLock key. Occasionally, it will try to start, can tell when the keyboard lights also - but it will last varying amounts of time, never even getting started up even once. Touching any key will probably cause it to shut off immediately. Even just picking the laptop up will occasionally make it try to power on. Deeply disappointing. I've had good historical luck with laptops and HP's until now. Also, CD is on the right side - where ejecting it would interfere with a plug in mouse. This model is HEAVY - it's my desktop replacement to weight was not my primary concern, but still. Feels like quality, looks great. Keyboard doesn't use nearly the possible area, leaving huge real estate useless for the sake of the large screen. Only 4 USB ports when so many models have more today. Power brick is very large and heavy, but at least uses a standard A/C cord to it. Hopefully the Marketplace reseller can make this purchase right, and right away.

..

35853342 I have another color printer for other uses, but this printer prints out quickly and clearly for everyday use. The print quality is clear and sharp.

..

35853342 Printer is easy to setup and simple to use. It's a very reliable printer - we have multiple printers of the same model throughout our office, and we've actually started to replace all older models with this one.

..

35853342 Excellent printer for the money. It's a new model so recharged cartridges are not available yet, but they soon will be. I use it as a personal printer that replaced my old 4L. Comparing my old printer to this one is like comparing a VW Bug to a Ferrari.

..

35853342 great print quality and fast sharp color I recommended this printer to a friend way before I purchased

..

35853342 I have spent a lot of money to have to get up after every 2-3 pages to clear the print jams. Glad it's under warranty and I have my receipt... TAKING IT BACK!!!!

..

35853342 It is an excellent product. Ideal for a medium company. In one equipment, we can print, copy and scan without much space. Easy configuration and good quality.

..

35853342 For new home based insurance agency, did a marathon online research on AOI printers (still have a 7 year old HP 7300 AIO for backup and color). Bought the m425dn 2 weeks ago.
Was initially swayed by some negative reviews (mostly from late 2012 before firmware release), but decided to buy this unit vs. lower cost HP 8600 Plus Inkjet AIO and other highly rated AIO Lasers because:
- did not need or want to mess with color ink cartridges
- duplex scanning
- very fast scanning (and printing)
- recommended up to 3,000 pages per mo. (50k monthly duty cycle)
- widely available non-oem toner cartridges at 25% HP toner cost for VERY LOW costs per page /
- high toner print page capacity (6700 pages with "x" toner)
- gigabit network speed nice
- ePrint / print to cloud / network
- color scanning
- 2nd tray for envelopes / other paper - 50 pages
- Expandable 250 page input tray option
So far VERY happy. Lightning fast scan / print sped esp. for non-pdf files. It's good looking to boot! Named Black beauty. I did buy locally (read pay taxes) so could return / exchange if any problems).
The only cons I can think of is that it is not real quiet and the wattage use is quite high when printing, though I did not spec this against other printers with similar speeds / printing capacity.
If the above factors are important to you, go for it.

..

35853342 I bought this machine for my home office and for about a month it was fantastic - it did everything as it should, the copies were done quickly, colors sharp, scanner good. Then out of nowhere I got the message "Scanner Error 22" after which the machine would power up, then this message would appear and it would do nothing. This is when things go downhill fast. The HP service is the worst imaginable. The only online service is a PAY FOR service, there is no free online assistance other than a forum in which unofficial and customer questions and answers are posted. It was on the forum that I discovered "Scanner Error 22" to be a common problem for which there is no soluation currently. Eventually I found a number for FREE PHONE assistance. After over 2 hours on the phone (not including the time I was just disconnected after beginning a call) a hardware problem was diagnosed and it was agreed to send me a new machine, BUT in order to not wait up to 3 WEEKS for the replacement I had to pay $17 for expedited shipping to get it within 3 working days. I did just receive the new printer, set it up, and it seems to work. I expect it to break again soon and at that point I will not endure the HP customer service, but will recycle it and buy one from a different company. Under no circumstances would I recommend that anyone ever purchase this machine.

..

35853342 If the toner lasts as long as it says it will, and it has no other mechanical issues, I will be very happy. It should last our family I am guessing over a year to 2 years. Plus if the quality does not vary over that length of time, I will continue to buy printers like this, or toner for this one if it is reasonable, but unfortunately like most printers, weather ink or laser, the printer new with ink or toner is not much more money than just buying ink or toner by themselves. So I will probably buy a new printer and get a warranty with it.

..

35853342 I have used this printer for 3 months and the quality of the prints is great. It takes a little while to print but that is expected. I like that the printer has both color and black printing capabilities as well as a feeder scan. Already need a replacement black toner cartridge but I print quite a bit.

..

35853342 This printer failed less than 24 hours after installation. There is some defect in the scanner/copier hardware, causing it to throw an error. After 90minutes online with HP support, they offered to replace it. I have the Best Buy coverage, however the two defective Epson printers I just returned soured me on Best Buy. HP shipped a refurbished replacement in four days.

..

35853342 This printer is defective. It came without a paper tray and had a scanning error that we had to send it back to HP. THey sent us another one that had a feeder error. Not worth the money.

..

35853342 I wish that I would have gotten a hand manual.
Otherwise, I do not have any complaints. Works great!

..

35853342 This scanner/printer does nothing well. I'm on #2 (returned the 1st one it was so bad). I have given up using the top feeder. It can not feed any document straight & regularly chews up my documents. Now it is skewing data at the top of scans from the flatbed. I've had the replacement printer less than 1 month & although I don't do a huge volume of printing, I'm having to change the print cartridges.

..

35853342 Easy and complete set-up. All functions work. Was able to connect to all my computers including Ipad. Print quality better than all of my past inkjet printers. Note that the last HP inkjet printer I purchased was a complete waste of money. Blew through ink cartridges and only lasted 2 years. I went with a color laserjet this time because I have one at work and it has been great.

..

35853342 Love the ease and quality of the printer, but did not know that I need different quality/grade of paper to print.

..

35853342 We purchased this together with Mac , setting up was easy but to communicate with the Mac was not. It took as a while, but it finally worked. After two weeks of purchase, price on Valentine's Day dropped to $249. So I sent an email to customer service that Friday for a price match, they replied to me Monday, and the price went back up to $299. Long story short, didn't get the price match! Not happy...

..

35853342 We bought this to replace our super old XP machine at the office. I was pretty upset when it arrived because the recovery discs that came packed with it say Windows 8 and the machine itself has a Windows 8 logo on it. I had specifically chosen this PC (which had to be shipped since it wasn't available in stores) because it was advertised as Windows 7 Pro. In the end I thought, "What the heck, just hook it up, it might still be W7 in there." Sure it enough it was!
I was pleasantly surprised about how little bloatware is on the machine (considering it's by HP). So far it runs great, is very quiet, and handles all the business applications we run on a daily basis.
Someone else mentioned it being advertised with a DVD/CD burner, I'm not sure about that, as I was more concerned with processing power and memory, but he's right. This machine does not have a DVD/CD burner, so look elsewhere if that's something you want.
Someone else also mentioned it's a little bigger than it needs to be for what's inside, but our previous machine was ancient and this one is significantly smaller and lighter. I'd say about standard for most desktops today.

..

35853342 Purchased for my mother to replace her XP machine. It was easy to set up and she has had no problems with the machine.

..

35853342 It had no dvd burner like it said and I had to drive it back to the store 55 miles away. Lost money on the deal. People at the store were very nice at returning the product.

..

35853342 The description of this computer as having Windows 7.
Actual product received came with Windows 8.

..

35853342 Just what our business was looking for...not windows 8

..

35853342 these are great computers for business. we have upgraded two of the four that we bought with 4 more gigs of memory. i lone the fact that you can hook up two monitors.

35853342 I would buy another one and will when I have to!!!

..

35853342 I would recommend this printer to anyone. Fast, high quality, great bang for your buck.

..

35853342 I love being able to be sitting on my couch with my tablet and have the option to print something without having to connect to the printer with a cord. So convenient! The printer quality is just fine for what we use it for. We also love the small footprint it has. No complaints thus far! We have recommended it to family members to purchase.

..

35853342 Easy to setup as a wireless printer. No more EXPENSIVE ink, since I print B&W 99.9% of the time. Replacement toner is expensive...might just buy a new unit instead...will cross that bridge when I get to it. SUPER FAST....click print and BANG its done

..

35853342 Super easy to set up, works great through wifi. I highly recommend this!

..

35853342 Applause to the salesperson who went Beyond the course of duty to match a price for us. Really impressed my husband, not the believer in sales!!!

This printer also has wifi-print , so I do not have to worry about cable, I can put this printer in center of my house, and everybody in my family can use it. This printer is very fast response. overall, this printer is very excellent for small family.

..

35853342 Was able to set it up very easy and quickly, prints very fast.

..

35853342 I am glad that I bought this printer because now I finally have the ability to print from my iPad. It works very well with my computer also. I like not having to plug the printer into my computer and being able to print from across the room.

..

35853342 Needed something to record (digitally) photographs, documents, etc. so a scanner was an essential piece of equipment. As a graphic artist, I can create my own stuff - at home - without pirating time or material from my employer. I know I could probably make do with a digital camera, but I like having choices.

..

35853342 I have great difficulty scanning slides. The instructions do not provide any directions to set controls for slides. In a batchscan, some come out others do not or are skipped for no apparent reason. i purchased this scanner speciffically for the slide scan capability and I am VERY disapointed. There is also no method for selecting only portions of a photo to capture.

..

35853342 I ordered for store p;ickup, and it arrive sooner than promised. It works exactly as claimed. I can now scan large old negatives as well as 35mm slides and film.

..

35853342 HP is the bst brand to use for scanners of computer moinitors.

..

35853342 I bought this specifically for scanning slides and negatives after my HP Photosmart kicked the bucket. If I try to scan slides using the slide option, they are all black and it takes forever editing. Can use the negative option, and they actually come out, but it changes the color that is actually in the slides and it can not be corrected (water in lake changed to pink, should have been blue/sandy color, etc.).
I do like this much better than the scanner that is part of my all in one HP printer/scanner for pdf files, it's fairly fast and it allows me to put many scans into one file/folder.
So if you want a scanner for slides or negs, don't get this one! Should have gone for a newer HP photosmart - loved the old one. Reason for choosing this one was the price, so I guess I got what I paid for.

..

35853342 Within my family 4 tablets were purchased: 2 for my nephews 1 form y 6 year old grandson and the other for my 9 year old granddaughter. All four had to be returned to the factory for the exact same repair. This is not only inconvenient but disappointing. Post repairs the tablet has worked fine.
The fact that all four had to be returned for the exact same problem makes me think it would have been better if HP had just recalled the tablets.
I chose to use the standard FREE shipping which means my grandchildren will be without a tablet and back to using my laptop or my husbands Samsung Tablet.
I am in the market for a tablet and would have loved to purchase the HP however it would be silly of me to purchase a 5th tablet and have the same problem. Note, my granddaughters power cord also had to be replaced.

..

35853342 Tablet is easy to use and has good features and screen quality for its size

..

35853342 I purchased the notepad on line best buy so i could have multiple folders of pics with various hairstyles and colors on my home screen so I could quickly and Easily scroll through with my clients. I took it to best buy and an employee from geek squad showed me that the only way to do this is by downloading an app, in this case I used quickpic. Now fortunately it seems to be doing the job. I would say definitely try it out yourself in the store before purchasing.

..

35853342 Alright, this is a birthday gift for my youngest son. Did not want to buy a cheaper brand or no name brand, HP does offer a one year warranty. The device does look very good for it's price range. My son watches a lot of videos on it and it looks good. Battery actually only lasts about 2 hours when constantly watching videos. About 4-5 hours when not watching videos. Recharge time is very, very long. The device really does not over heat which is a concern for a lot of these devices. Google play store is a plus as it offers a lot of apps, especially a lot of free apps that are actually good. Main complaint is when the device battery runs down and you plug in the charger it will still shut down some times as though there's no power. Then it comes back on after a few minutes of being plugged in. Only other complaint is it takes forever to boot up when powered on. These two issues are the main reason I give it 3-stars.

..

35853342 For the price, this tablet has been very good. It has all the qualities we were looking for, except speakers are very weak for the audio being dubbed beats audio.
Battery only lasts a few hours at most with moderate use. Not a huge issue for the price, but was slightly disappointed about it. Recent updates may help.
Have 5, 7, 11 year olds using it. Absolutely loving it, with no operating issues.

..

35853342 No complaints on the product and i use it daily.Good for the price and the addition of a micro card makes it better to hold more pictures.Thinking of getting my kids one as well

..

35853342 Ordered this device online and waited a week for in-store pickup. The day after I got it as I was just going thru the various applications and seeing how things worked under the android system which was a new interface for me. The slate simply locked up on me and I had to hard power cycle it to bring it back up. It did this twice within 2 hours.
When I asked other droid owners at work if that was normal behavior, they said no that their devices never hung up. I decided to return it and get the Samsung Tab 3. Have had the Tab 3 for a couple of weeks now and no lockups have occurred so far.

35853342 I love this tablet.The web browser is the best. Price, quality, Grate sound. Easy to use.Also Have another Hp 9 inch tablet for couple of years.
Love Hp products.!

..

35853342 perfect gift, i loved my tablet, i went to peru and it worked pecfect

..

35853342 Great tablet for the price. Awesome audio, apps & expandable memory all in a perfect size tablet. Camera gets the job done but could definitely be improved.

35853342 On line use started without problems. Unfortunately after the Windows 8.1 upgrade, the computer was worthless. Targeted ads were far too numerous, they actually blocked access to the "shopping cart". I have Norton 360 and a full scan only found a few tracking cookies. This did not help. I also tried Kerensky and Microsoft virus scanners without improvement. Nothing helped. The ads are like a swarm of bees. They will sting your on line use. Frustration got the better of me. I reformatted the hard drive and Installed Unbutu 14.04 Linux. NO MORE ADS!!! I WONE!
Caution, this will void ASUS warranty.

..

35853342 Cons: The touchpad is very slow to respond and feels cheap. The battery life is around 1 and half hour. The laptop is slow. Coming from XP, Windows 8 is very confusing.
Pros: Touchscreen
I bought this for my 10 years old daughter, but after using it for a month or so, she got frustrated and again started sharing my macbook.

..

35853342 THIS IS A GREAT COMPACT LAPTOP. HAVE NOT HAD ANY ISSUES! GREAT PRICE TOO!

..

35853342 This has a battery built in. Brand new and fully charged battery barely holds charge for two hours and that's AFTER settings are adjusted to use minimal amount of battery. To replace battery when i gets to point where it holds less of a charge you have to send in to manufacturer and they charge about $150 to replace it.
Keys on keyboard are smaller than others this size.
Have to hit space bar very hard for spacing
Audio at its maximum is poor.
Would never recommend or purchase another one of these again. Not worth the "savings"
ASUS customer "service" very poor

..

35853342 I would have given this machine a 5 star, if not for being unable to update to Windows 8.1. Windows 8.1 doesn't show up in the Windows store, despite having updated all windows update items. KB2871389 is a required update to get Win8.1, and when trying to install, I get a message stating that this update is not applicable to my computer.

..

35853342 Nice computer for the price battery life is ok good size

..

35853342 Returned a Chromebook for this Asus laptop and glad I did. I needed a laptop that I could use on and off line. Clearly, a chromebook doesn't cut it for me.
I purchased this Asus right after Christmas at Best Buy. And what a good time to buy a laptop. It was an open box item priced at $215 and Best Buy took off another 20%. And I got a $15 Best Buy card on top of it. Final price was $187. No complaints here.
It is a decent little laptop. Its good at basic productivity work (MS Office, surfing the web, email and facebook). I do a lot of word processing and the keyboard has a good layout and nice response to it. The screen is glossy and that can be distracting at times. But the touchscreen makes up for it. Navigation is a snap with the touchscreen.
I did upgrade to Win 8.1 and you should know that it will take a while. After updating the necessary Window 8 updates ( which took 2 hours), updating to Win 8.1 took 4-5 hours. So be prepared and be patient. It is worth it. Performance improves. Office 365 install took about 45 minutes.
After everything was installed, it works perfectly. No crashes. System boots up in 25 seconds. About 3 seconds from sleep mode. Battery is 3 to 3-1/2 hours if you use the Asus energy settings and the screen brightness turned down a bit. And Asus didn't load it up with a lot bloatware.
The footprint is not that much bigger than a chromebook. The power cord is not one of those god awful brick style. Its a compact design and charges to full charge in a couple of hours. The laptop weighs less than 3 pounds and is much easier to lug around compared to my 15.6" Samsung laptop. It fits in my 12" vertical man bag with room for the power cord and a wireless mouse.
Despite the fact that its not a powerhouse laptop, it certainly does what its supposed to do. I recommend it to any professional that needs to grab email, do some Office work, etc. All in all, I'm very pleased with it.

..

35853342 This is a great product for a student wanting to bring something small to school. It is very fast, and super thin. The touch screen is very convenient for a tech savvy person who wants a small fast, but not big on storage computer to do basic things like surf the web or check emails.

..

35853342 Great little laptop I picked up for a song at a black friday sale. Touch screen works well and its light- even has bluetooth. Good deal all around. Downloaded windows classic shell so I don't have to be bothered by the whole metro thing. Not a super gaming platform, but plays LOTRO reasonably well in medium settings. Threw in an SSD and it absolutely flys now in normal use.

Create customized CDs and DVDs with this Asus DVDRW/CD-RW drive that features double-layer support for expanded recording capacity. The USB 2.0 interface offers simple connectivity.


..

35853342 Seems a little slow but for the price works as it should. Remember it is for windows and not MAC

..

35853342 The drive connected and was easily installed.great for newer laptops which no longer have the player built in.

..

35853342 Works just as it should. Our new laptop didn't have a cd-rom and we needed to install a program that came on a cd. It was easy to set up and installed the software without any issues.

..

35853342 Inexpensive and easy to use. Bought the ASUS T100 and needed an external drive. This drive paired perfectly. Just plugged and it played. No external power needed for the drive. Light and compact.

..

35853342 Bought this to go with a new laptop (also Asus) that does not have an internal optical drive. Machine has Win 8.1 on it. No issues at all plugging it in and getting it setup. Really only need it to install some programs that came with CD's. Haven't tried to burn a disc with it, yet. Looks good and works good so far.

..

35853342 The ASUS external drive works as expected and the brushed metal look is nice. The tray is rather slim, so not the best for clumsy adults or kids.

..

35853342 I got this to be able to add programs to or watch dvd's on my computer that does not have a cd/dvd drive. It was very easy to install and did just what I wanted. I have only used it to install 2 programs so far so I have not used it a lot but s far so good.

..

35853342 It did not come with the stand shown on the advertised picture in the flyer

..

35853342 This is a good CD/DVD drive for newer computers that do not come with internal drives.

..

35853342 Very good easy to use and very fast equipment really highly recommended

The new ASUS Eee Pad Sleeve is designed to fit Eee Pad Transformer TF101 in simple and lightweight elegance, with an interior that uses smooth velvet to protect valuables from scratching and damage.


..

35853342 This is nice notepad, however it's cheap, The on off switch does not work. I'm taking it back to Best Buy tomorrow, I suppose it will have to be sent to the factory to be repaired, I've only had it about 5 weeks. Other defects include , not being able to see the dirctories on a USB external card when connect to a PC, sometimes it works sometimes not. It is supposed to support MP4 video, however when copying a video to the device it warns that MP4 is not supported. The video still play but sometimes when copying, the copy process will stop and give an error message.

..

35853342 This cover does not fit the tablet tightly as it should to protect it. It sldes around inside the cover. Also the cover conceals the power button. The material is nice: It could be a nice product if it fit better and the power button was exposed. The other buttons, charging slot, etc. are exposed but the power button was very difficult to push with the silly cover on top of it. Also the price on these things is ridiculous - captured market!
I am returning the cover and looking for something better.

..

35853342 I bought a new Asus tablet and this was the only case in the store. It works, I find that I have to put my tablet in upside down to make the stand work the way I want it then the buttons do not line up. Also the material is not smooth, which is probably by design so it is easier to hold on to, but it also makes it harder to get into the case I have for it. It does do the job but I really wish I could get one more like the ipad stand that covers the sreen and becomes a stand when open and that is it.

Software APSoftware AP mode allows the WLAN card to act as a virtual access point. The computer needs to be connected to a wired network using an Ethernet connection in order to provide network access to WLAN client.


..

35853342 I purchased this adapter to replace a USB WiFi adapter which wasn't giving me more than 52 Mbps, due to walls and other obstructions between my computer and the router at the other end of the house.
The installation was quick and simple. By pressing one button on the router, communications was established between the router and the adapter.
Immediately upon installing the Asus - IEEE 802.11n PCI Express - Wi-Fi Adapter, my throughput increased to 72 Mbps and has stayed there. I believe the big advantage this adapter has over my previous WiFi adapter is a much larger antenna and direct access to the system buss.

USB-N10 is the smallest wireless USB adapter in the world. Boasting a 3 cm body length, it is easy to carry and takes up little space when attached to a notebook. Compared to most USB Wi-Fi adapters, it is extremely compact and sturdy with its pocket-sized format and strong plug-in design. This small size and strengthened one-piece shape allows a host notebook to be connected to the USB-N10 even when it is placed in a slim carrying case or bag. Thus you can enjoy constant connectivity with the ASUS USB-N10.


..

35853342 I use this on my desktop. I don't want to run a long ethernet cable to the router and this is perfect solution.

..

35853342 I slightly damaged (cracked) my MacBook Pro in the back where the black fold is between the keyboard and screen display. So, when you open the laptop, it looks as if its gonna disconnect. My computer would not initially boot up and I was told I had a hard drive failure. As a result, my airport no longer worked. My hard drive was recovered but I was told by an Apple rep that my airport or wifi connection was damaged and in order to be able to connect to the internet in the future, I would need to spend at least $400 to purchase a new screen (or top half of my laptop- although my display screen is perfectly in tact). However, a friend who is a pc guru said 'no way 'and found this adapter that is compatible with a Mac. Thank God! I only paid less than $20 and I was back in business!! What a lifesaver!
A great ending for me! It works so purchase if needed! So you too can have a great ending.

..

35853342 Cheap price. Dysfunctional setup. This item will not retain connection. Poor product do not buy

..

35853342 This product turned my computer into a wireless system in less than five minutes! All I had to do was run the CD and plug in the USB part. There were no problems with compatibility issues or installation. It immediately recognized my wireless router and connected. It also warned me before installation of any possible issues of security. I highly recommend this product to anyone who is "computer challenged".

..

35853342 I contemplated taking my MacBook to a repair shop because it was unable to maintain a wireless connection. I saved probably hundreds by getting this little flash-drive sized transmitter. I get a great signal and have had 0 problems in the past month or so that I have had the product. It works!

..

35853342 I came in a shorter time than expected. I pluged it in and installed the software and was up and running right away. I was very pleased.

..

35853342 Great product for the price. It's also very small and a great option for laptops.

..

35853342 This wireless adapter is small, has a good range and is easy to install.

..

35853342 Hard to figure some set up features from the on line instruction. Connects only after you give the program permission to run...inconvenient if things need an internet connection right away!!! I always have to click yes on the user control window that pops up. Will automatically start without giving permission after 2 or 3 minutes however!!! Not sure if this is the way it works or something that is set on my computer which causes this. Did not have to do this with an older Adapter I was using!!! Range is decent, I guess??? Desktop Computer is only about 15 ft away from Wi-Fi Router, not sure how it would work further away???

..

35853342 I have a large home with a modem (with Wi-Fi) in the basement. I have an older computer upstairs. This adapter works perfectly! Very happy with the purchase and would highly recommend this product.

35853342 I purchased the Asus - NVIDIA GeForce 210 1GB GDDR2 PCI Express 2.0 Graphics Card so I could use my Pasonic HDMI with my 4 year old Dell computer. I purchased this video card online from Best Buy. Best Buy had the lowest price. It arrived in three days. The video card was easy to install. It took serval tries to install the drivers frome the CD that was included in Windows Vista. It took a little longer to install the drivers in Ubuntu Linux. I have two operating system in this computer. I am very pleased witth this graphic card. The graphic are awesome in Windows and Linux.

AT&T; ATTCL80111 Cordless Handset


..

35853342 added 2 phones to my system, wish the phones' outer shell was not so slick and had more grip to it

..

35853342 Everything went well. I am very pleased with this purchase.

..

35853342 I bought two handsets to extend my number of handsets to 7. All of the other 6 handsets work great. But this one (of 2) that I bought from Best Buy did not work from the start.

..

35853342 
When connected to a compatible AT&T; phone system, this AT&T; CL80100 DECT 6.0 cordless expansion handset helps you remain in touch with friends and relatives. A speakerphone function allows clear hands-free communication.


..

35853342 Ordered as a replacement for old handsets and it was very easy to setup and exactly what I thought it would be.

..

35853342 Bought this phone as an expandable phone for my mother to keep in her wheelchair. It was very easy to add to the other four phones purchased.

..

35853342 I had a 4 handset system. With this I added a 5th hand set.

..

35853342 Great family phone. Good price. Love the capability to have many phones. Very user friendly. My 90 year old Mother is able to see the larger numbers and adjust the volume to her hearing ability. Would definitely recommend this phone.

..

35853342 Had all the features I need.
Lightweight
Easy to read display and keypad

..

35853342 We bought two of these to expand our home phone. They work great and were easy to set up. Unfortunately, they are a little overpriced. Knock $10 bucks off of it, then it would get a 5-star rating.

..

35853342 The size and shape is not good for holding on your shoulder, without using your hands.

..

35853342 Sleek design, lots of features, sound not clear, poor reception

..

35853342 I chose this phone system so we could add several handsets - and this had more capacity than any other phone system Best Buy carried. Its a decent phone, easy to use and understand. Call announcer's voice often hard to understand - only complaint.

..

35853342 When I placed my order, I didn't see the policy listing the brief amount of time allowed to return a product. Our landscaping company is very busy this time of year so I didn't have a chance to call for 1 month. Now I'm stuck with a product I can't use. Will NOT recommend Best Buy to anyone.

AT&T; ATTCL82201 DECT Cordless Phone - Cordless - 1 x Phone Line - Caller ID


..

35853342 This is the best phone system we have had. It has great sound quality and so easy to read all the items on the face of the phone. the answering system is equally as easy to read the front and to use. The price was also very reasonable. We are extremely happy with this system.

..

35853342 Easy to install, nice features like caller I.d., works well so far.

..

35853342 This is a good quality telephone with all of the features that I needed.

..

35853342 I purchased this item after my Panasonic stopped working. This item much better quality, especially given the price.

..

35853342 I like this phone system because it has a nice clean base without a lot of extra "not needed" gadgets on it. The best part is that the numbers are really large and they also light up. I also like the larger display screen. Everything is much easier to see on this phone. What I'm not so crazy about is the way the menu /select button has to be used. Seems like you have to press it so much for just such simple things. Seems like there should be an easier way. Maybe I just have to get used to it! All in all, I do like the system compared to what I've had in the past.

..

35853342 this is a very useful phone and it has done everything we have needed. No glitches yet

..

35853342 It is too early to give a good idea of how the phone fits in with our program.

..

35853342 I need to cover several rooms without having to install phone jacks so this is the system for me. My answering machine died and finding a new one with an audible message alert was my primary feature. Got it!

..

35853342 This is a great phone by AT&T ... You also get 3 additional handset for other rooms.

..

35853342 Good replacement phone with very good sound and features.
Great price and easy to setup and use.

Asus XONAR DG Sound Board - CMI8786 - PCI - 24 bit - Internal


..

35853342 Do not hesitate to upgrade your on-board audio to this ASUS Xonar DG. Even with a $300+ mother boards, you are still stuck with Realtek or Cirrus Logic audio chipsets which can not outdo a good quality ASUS Xonar or Creative X-Fi card.
If you have a good 2.1 channel system or just use headphones, this card will provide near-audiophile quality sound clarity and details. If you are considering the optical 5.1 out, go for a better card. The SPDIF out controls from the software interface can sometimes be non-responsive and will provide you with no digital output.
For $30, this is the most affordable quality audio upgrade you can purchase. Creative Labs have not been doing too well in recent years and their low end cards generate average sound crispness and they are leaned towards gaming audio development which makes their product lines such as the new Recon3D unsuitable for music listeners.

Safeguard your Motorola Moto X cell phone in style with this Incipio DualPro MT-246 case, which features a rigid Plextonium shell and an impact-absorbing silicone core for a durable design. The soft-touch finish provides a stylish appearance.


..

35853342 I like that it offers good protection for my phone without adding bulk like a lot of other phone cases.

..

35853342 I've owned a number of Incipio cases for several different smartphones and this was the first one that I was disappointed with. The case like all Silicrylic or Dual Pro cases is two parts with a silicone portion and a harder acrylic portion that fits over it to add some protection. I like the style and fit of Incipio cases and the soft touch feel. However this white case shows dirt and is turning a pinkish color that won't come clean with any type of cleaner. Not sure where the color is coming from as it's not kept in any kind of case that would cause that color. The only thing I can think of is just normal oils from the hands.

35853342 This CPU is just perfect for anything you need to do, and if your not doing anything sits at about 0-2% which means energy savings. I would recommend this CPU to any PC gamer or anyone in need of a performance CPU!

..

35853342 The Processor is great, awesome performance but theres currently a BIOS problem with the DX79** motherboards from Intel, you have to update it to fix the problem but basicly the problem wont let you restart the system. After trying a lot of times I managed to update the BIOS and it works great. The solution that Intel proposes is: Get a Intel Processor from 39** Family and update BIOS, after that the problem is solved, the bad thing on this is, its kinda hard to find someone to lend you a Processor to update your BIOS xD. Sorry for the bad grammar, english isnt my main language :)

Introducing the two port MiniView Micro KVM switch from IOGEAR - a simple solution for those with more PCs than hands. Use one keyboard, one monitor and one mouse to control two PC or Macintosh systems.* This self-powered KVM switch features mouse & keyboard emulation to ensure smooth operation, as well as support for Plug-n-Play monitors and most wheel mice. Our patented VSE Video Signal Enhancement technology provides rich, 32-bit color at resolutions up to 1920 x 1440. With KVM cables (6' long) molded into the unit, all you need to do is to plug it into your computers, and you've got a complete KVM solution from IOGEAR.  * Macintosh support requires IOGEAR's Mac Adapter.


..

35853342 I recently had the occasion to set up another computer that I was repairing. I did not have room, nor did I want to set up another monitor. This IOGEAR KVM switch filled my needs perfectly. Now that I have the computer repaired I can easily switch the monitor and keyboard from one PC to the other by two quick strokes of the scroll lock key.
There is also a function that will switch back and forth between the two PCs at adjustable intervals, although I have not had a need for this yet.
This is a well designed switch and should be trouble free for years to come. The built-in 6 foot cables were more than ample for my needs.

..

35853342 I am glad I waited for a week to write this review. At first the product seemed great, easy to hook up and easy to use. I had absolutely no problems for the first week. Today, all day my mouse has worked, and then not worked consistently until it finally stopped working all together. Just to make sure I attempted to plug the mouse directly into both computers, it worked without fail both times. Yet still would not work through the KVM switch. I went and purchased a new mouse, just to be sure, and again it does not work when hooked up to the KVM switch. I have now been online for over 2 hours explaining my situation over and over and over again to their representative (I am literally copying and pasting exactly what I have just told them). They continue to ask questions that are already answered. I am getting no where. I am heading back to Best Buy today to return it. For this headache I would rather pay a little bit more, or have a few extra strokes to do in order to switch computers. The price and ease of use were originally great, but the headache a week later is not worth it.

..

35853342 no brainer installation, works just like it is supposed to. No issues with connections or anything like that when rebooting, as others have said. using on XP desktop and Vista laptop

..

35853342 I owned a KVM that I was using to control 2 computer video outputs into the KVM inputs to one KVM video output and switching the KVM with a button on the unit. There was no keyboard or mouse connected to the KVM. The old unit expired and this unit would not work in this fashion. I returned it for a refund.

..

35853342 No brainer to set up. Switching is as easy as pushing the scroll lock key twice. Resolution (1280) is not impacted. Using with Win 7 and XP desktops without any problems other than having to switch to the XP computer when booting to have the monitor work. I don't have the problem with the Win 7 desktop. Issue is with the XP desktop. Great product for those of us migrating to Win 7 and finding some apps don't work.

..

35853342 I love this. I can work from one station and be able to look up things on my old computer with the double click of ONE key. This has saved so much time and made my life much easier.

..

35853342 needed to use two cumputers with one keyboard, mouse, and monitor.
this did the job nicely.

..

35853342 IOGear does it again with another GREAT KVM switch... I have 2 of their 4 computer switches and they are great too... If you need to also switch your audio out (speaker out) then go with one of them instead...
Works as speced out... Easy setup... Great price considering all cables are included...
Thumb screws to secure video cable could be a little smaller in diameter for man fingers to tighten them... I got them tightened but smaller diameter would have given my thumbs more clearance to grasp...

..

35853342 I have found KVM's to almost be a must have when you have multiple computers (desktops and laptops). This one is easy to use, doesn't fail and easliy tucked away.

..

35853342 It was so easy to setup I was shocked. No need for a manual, flyers with step by step directions, or online support. Just plug and play. No adapter required either. It basically is like plugging in an extension cord and it was all set to go. Mind you I only bought this little device last night, so only time will tell how it holds up. If the durability isn't as expected I will make sure and return to post about it.

Easily transfer media from your mobile phone, tablet or camera to a USB 3.0-enabled device using this IOGEAR GFR381 multicard reader that supports a wide range of memory card format and offers data transfer rates up to 5 Gbps for efficient use.


..

35853342 it is simple, easy to instal and I have not had any problems

..

35853342 I wish it includes a status light showing the reader is working or idling.

..

35853342 always go to Best Buy to purchase items in this area as I trust the product and the sales people are always helpful and knowledgeable.

..

35853342 I was tired of using my USB 2 on a Macbook Pro and decided to make the jump. Good idea! Speed is everything.

..

35853342 It was good for the first couple uses and then the next time I tried to use it, the port where I connect the USB cable to the card reader started to become loose to the point where it had completely detached itself. There is no way to fix this without breaking it open or buying a new one. I am sad that for this value, I got such a bad outcome. My next card reader will be one of those where the usb cable is permanently attached to the reader.

..

35853342 With USB 3.0 it transfers quickly. I do a lot of photography and needed to move images (16 - 32GB at a time) this does it very well. I use Windows 8 64. no issues.

..

35853342 I forgot my USB cable to transfer pictures from my camera to my computer and bought this device. It is extremely useful since you don't need to have your camera plugged while you transfer images.

..

35853342 It's really good product with great value for money. I attached it to my Bose speaker and able to play audio from any device.

..

35853342 I bought the product and I was satisfied but it's not very durable it hit the ground once and the cover came off then eventually the charging port came apart so great product but if you travel from car too home stereo allot better put some kind of protection around it

35853342 After several back and forth with Kanex, they asked for a receipt, which I emailed. It was the 8.5v11 printout of the online shopping receipt. Kanex saw the BestBuy logo, and said take it back to BestBuy. The BestBuy site says "not returnable to BB stores."

35853342 My wife was looking for a DVD rack to hold her DVDs. The price had to be good. I seen this rack on beast.com, it is not sold in the store. It look good and hold 50 plus DVDs.

..

35853342 The item was a good price and was shipped in a reasonable time period. It wasn't, however, of the quality I expect from Best Buy.

..

35853342 I had trouble finding something that would hold DVDs, not BluRay. I was looking for a sleek look, with a small foot print. not a piece of furniture but just a simple holder. I also didn't want to pay a lot for something to hold my DVDs.

..

35853342 A little wobbly but does the job and doesnt tip. Still worth the money. Hold a lot, looks nice. Although nobly when pushed on, they hold dvds sturdy.

..

35853342 I bought this mainly for xbox 360 games but i only take up alittle over half of the slots with those so are using the rest for dvds n blurays. It's a great way to organize your collection n get extra shelf space. Holds 52 and looks good as well, with a great price. The only downside (that I can find) is that it only has one slot for double sized cases such as collections n games that have more than 3 discs to a case. It's not a real setback though.(esp for me). If I get more games or movies such as that, I'm just going to use a dremel tool to cut a bar out and make a single slot into a double.(a 2 minute fix if that). I'll prob spray a bit of black paint over the cuts, even though it's not needed.(that's just how I am) Over all I'm very happy with the product,price, and the service at best buy. I would recommend it to anyone. I'll prob. buy another myself, as my collection grows.

..

35853342 You need to be carefull as it will tip over easy. NOT like an older model.

..

35853342 I bought this tower for my son's games and DVDs because he has them all over his room. The tower keeps falling over even if we place it in a corner. We ended up placing the games and DVDs in a box for storage.

..

35853342 This tower is a decent buy. Just make sure you understand what you are getting. This does NOT fit CD cases at all! I ended up setting a couple of CD sized cases on the top DVD between the posts, but it looks goofy. Also, there is only ONE slot for a wide-case DVD (for special editions and tv show season sets).
The good thing is that it is fairly stable, even on carpet, and it holds a good amount of cases. I don't have a huge collection of movies, so this works great to fit my entire collection and leaves me room for several more.

..

35853342 Ordered online, Fast delivery for holidays, great value.

..

35853342 The description of "52-Disc Nestable CD/DVD Tower " is WRONG. I bought this tower as a Christmas gift to my father to hold his collection of CD's. When he unwrapped it, the cardboard label stapled to the tower, clearly stated "52 DVD's / Blu Rays"; with no mention of being able to hold CD's - which it can't because the slots are too large. He was confused and so was I. I double checked the model number and the product I ordered was the product shipped to me......it's just not the product described on the website. If you need a tower that will hold CD's - DO NOT ORDER THIS MODEL.

This 32GB microSDHC memory card offers plenty of capacity for storing images and videos and features a minimum data transfer rate of 4MB/sec. for fast read and write times.


..

35853342 I've had good luck with Kingston Technology micro SD memory cards. They store data and I have yet to have any corrupt files.

..

35853342 It is amazing that 32 gigabytes can be crammed in such a small space. I can carry lots of music on my phone with this much storage.

..

35853342 I purchased this when I got my new cellphone in March 2013. Early in January 2014, the card stopped working. There was no warning, no notification about it (usually there's a prompt at the top saying how the sd card was removed unexpectedly), nothing. I only realize it happened while playing music and it stopped unexpectedly. I wouldn't recommend this card, but if you do get it/have it, back your data up often.

..

35853342 The purpose of me purchasing this was to increase memory on my cell phone to accommodate the pictures and music I like to store on my device for traveling so that when I am unable to access Wi-Fi, I still can use my device. I am not 100% disappointed but I am not 100% pleased. I still have to delete content to support new images uploaded.

..

35853342 I purchased this SD card mainly because of the price, 32GB for $20, but after having it for almost 6 months it died. i had over three thousand photos and videos of my daughter, now they're all gone :( i had it in my cellphone all the time and today it said that i had removed it when it was still inside, tried it on the computer but still doesn't work...

..

35853342 One of the huge advantages of the Microsoft Surface Pro over other tablets I own is having a micro-SD slot. This product comes with a regular sized SD card-"Jacket," as a way to allow you to use any standard sized SD card reader. Not to mention the price was very reasonable. Excellent product ... Period.

..

35853342 After ordering 2 different types because of "backorder" and shipping errors, I got both and had to go to the store to return one. Other than that, works as described

..

35853342 I couldn't believe a found such a high capacity Micro SD Card for less than $30. It gives me plenty of storage to use on my phone.

..

35853342 the price isnt too high and the amount of storage lets me store alot of files from my phone and my dslr camera

..

35853342 I used this for extra space on my phone to put music on and it works great.

35853342 I wanted a system that I could install Linux on. This was one of the easiest installs I have ever done, and I have done quite a few. First I backed up the Windows 7 the system came with. Then loaded the Linux DVD, selected my options, and away she went. I can now dual boot either Linux or Win 7. I also consider it an advantage that this machine has Win 7 on it, as my opinion of Win 8 is quite low. The system does come with Win 8 disks, if you want to take a step backward.

Equipped with four 3TB hard drives, this Lenovo Iomega ix4 70B89002NA device provides 12TB of network storage space to accommodate your office, work group or advanced home network. The built-in A/V server lets you stream content to media devices.


..

35853342 We take a LOT of pictures. We had nearly filled the drives on p/c and a laptop with pictures, and had multiple copies on other computers around the house as backups for when the inevitable drive failure struck. It was time to organize & better protect our hobby. The only problem I had was with my own firewall security in that the install could not find the device, but once I allowed the Iomega x4 12TD access to my network, the web install found the device, recovered where the install left off, and installed successfully with little intervention.
Ive been able to connect P/Cs & Laptops running on all of these Microsoft platforms: Vista, XP, Windows 2000, XP, Windows 7, and Windows 8. The only challenge is that each operating system connects differently but thats Microsoft, not the Iomega. We have finished moving nearly all of the pictures from all of the p/cs and incredibly have used only 2% of the total storage available. With RAID drives, I sleep better knowing things are safe. I paid more than I would have liked to, but I am completely satisfied with the product. The only downside I can think of is that its a bit noisier than most people would like, but for me its hidden away so its not a problem.

..

35853342 It is my expericence that Lenovo doesn't offer much support in terms of OS updates for their legacy tablets. I own a S2109 which satisfies most of my surf and game playing needs. However, when the S2109 was released last summer Android 4.1 was also out...a significant update by Google which fixes and improves performance by the CPU and GPU (aka Project Butter). I was hopeful that Lenovo would provide an update..nope. Instead when I called customer service I got no answer, long waits or the dumb response that "we have a newer tablet...you need to upgrade and buy that one now"...Wait I just spent my hard earn cash and I get this kind of support. Samsung, ASUS, ACER, and Toshiba all offer typically 1-2 OS updates for their tablets during their lifetimes. If getting future updates are important to you I would skip. Best Buy has a great selection of other tablets...in particular the Nook HD+ which can be updated via CM10 on micro-sd or Nexus 7. Sorry I can't recommend buying Lenovo until they commit to improving their customer support for Tablet owners

..

35853342 This tablet feels as acts like an IPad on Android. Screen is good (not HD great but is fine for most task and video). CPU although not Tegra 3 still is fairly fast. Great to have MicroSD, HDMI and micro-usb ports. Speakers sound good as well.
My biggest compliant is the lack of customer support from Lenovo. If this thing breaks good luck..they hardly carry any spare parts. Plus Lenovo refuses to release OS updates which means you will be stuck on ICS forever (even though Jellybean was available last year when this tablet was released). I've tried emailing and leaving messages on the Lenovo forums regarding the OS update issue but have yet to get a response. Calling Lenovo just puts you on long waits and holds with off-shore support persons who read from scripts and are unable to help.
If I was looking for a bargain Android I would suggest Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (bought my son and he loves it), ASUS or B&N Nook HD/HD+ (with CM10 loaded on sd card).

..

35853342 I picked up this tablet as a birthday present to my wife. I was looking for something running android, I was hoping to spend less than three hundred dollars, and I was looking for something with a bigger display than 7". Luckily I found this tablet on sale elsewhere, and BB was able to price match it, so for what I paid (hundred less than retail) I'd say this tablet is ABSOLUTELY worth it. It's running a very stock version of ICS, so you have all of the functionality you want from android with almost none of the bloatware/silly UI tweaks you don't. One thing to mention as many others have, the default "Go" keyboard is generally not as preferred as the built in ICS keyboard, but one quick settings change and you won't see the Go keyboard again.
Being as it's on an almost completely stock android build, you have full access to the google play store (reasons I was turned off by Kindle and HP products) as well as the amazon app store, so there's no shortage of working titles.
Even though the tablet is using an aging processor instead of the more popular Tegra's that are now becoming mainstream, response time using the tablet is generally very quick, although bigger/heavier flash intensive websites will sometimes give you unexpected pauses/jitters. Using any actual app however, I've not noticed any unusual behavior or slow downs.
Battery life very easily meets my expectations. I can't comment on how well it measures up to the manufacturer claims, but with normal use I haven't ran out or had a need to charge the tablet during use. Plug it in over night, and it's ready to go the whole next day.
As many have mentioned, the sound is quite good for a tablet. This has a quad speaker setup on the rear with SRS support, and can easily fill a small room with sound. Nothing to have you throw out your stereo yet, but very good for the size and compared to other tablets.
In addition to the older processor, there are a few other things to note that Sony scaled back on to keep the cost down which may or may not affect your decision.
While it is a nice large 9.7" display, it's worth noting that it's only a 4:3 aspect ratio at 1024x768 resolution. Personally even at this res, I think everything on the tablet looks just fine, however it is a noticeable difference compared to something running true HD or a retina display. That aside, the colors are crisp and clear, and thanks to the IPS display, there's less glare and wider viewing angles than standard LCD screens. This thing looks good at pretty much ANY angle.
Also, there's only a single, front facing camera which records at a max of 720p. I don't know about you, but I'm not getting a tablet with the expectation of using it for high quality photo shoots, so the fact that it can take photos and videos and works well in video chat such as google or skype is fine by me.
I think that about covers it. For the price I paid, I am exceptionally happy with this tablet. I knew what limitations to expect and that this wasn't a top of the line $600 piece of hardware, but for what it is I have not been underwhelmed at all.

35853342 I don't know if I got a bad one or something but for one the windows button wasn't even put on so that it was flat with the screen it had one side higher. If that would have been the only problem I would have been fine but the one I received after I would lock it and let it sit for 15-20 minutes it would lock up and the touchpad would not work so I couldn't unlock it and would have to restart it every time this happened so I returned it the very next day to buy.com which is a terrible company to return anything to cause it's at least going to be two weeks to get a refund which is just dumb!

..

35853342 We bought this with a gift card we needed to use up, works great for a 32g flash drive. No problems with it at all.

..

35853342 I like these speakers, they produce good sound and when I play music the quality is great.

..

35853342 I enjoy these speakers. Good sound and really enhances my music and your game sounds.

..

35853342 This product is good , it sound very good and is small enough to fit on a night stand without taking up too much space.I use it as an extension speaker for my TV on the wall so as to not to disturbed any person in the other room.It was very easy to set up and my only regret to not giving it 5 stars is because of the cord between the two speakers.I think that another 8 to 12 inches would have been perfect to fit on either side of the night stand of the bed.

..

35853342 For $30 it's a great deal and these speakers play the sound clearly, even if I turn it down or up. I use them with my HP Windows 8.1 computer, with no complaints, The sound is excellent (I don't need to blow my ear drums out to listen to good music, but these speakers can be turned up loud, if you want that.). I believe Logitech to be a reliable brand and these are a pretty good sized speakers for a computer.

..

35853342 I should have ordered something else. Not impressed. I guess you get what you pay for.

..

35853342 These little speakers sound great in my office and take up a very small foot print on my desk.

..

35853342 For under $30 I wasn't expecting earth shattering sound. I don't listen to music on computer a lot, I prefer my stereo. But these speakers are a great improvement over the small speakers in the computer. Good value for the money!

..

35853342 logitech is always the first choice,at least to me.
they make great keyboard, mice and speakers. the sound is not the best, but for this price , its unbeatable. also logitech has awsome warranty and customer service!
decent speaker for decent price!

..

35853342 What can you expect from $30 speakers? Blast your ears if you want to; sound can be way too loud if you like that. Tone adjustment is a nice extra. Long cords provide good placement options. Easy to set up and use either with my old TV for better sound or my Nextbook tablet. The 3.5mm plug (I assume) will work with any audio source that has this output jack. Nice looking black boxes with metal grill. Primary reason I got these is to use with my tablet because its built-in speaker doesn't provide the quality sound I want to listen to classical music and jazz. Am sure you can even better sound if you spend more money but, for me, these are perfect.

..

35853342 I bought these for my grandma, and I might get another set since they are really good and my speakers are going out. They sound quite good, they can get loud, and they have easy to use controls for volume.

..

35853342 I looked for a while to replace my 5.1 Headset. I have my computer in a 10x10 or so room. Although I have a very nice 7.1 Home Theater Setup in my [large] living room, I wasn't looking for anything special for my computer; just something to provide 5.1 sound at decent volume and reasonable sound quality so I could hear my games. I didn't want to put the 2 rear satellites on anything. The rear speakers had to be wall mountable and the setup had to come with its own amplifier. I had hoped to spend about $100 - $150.
I looked at several setups, particularly Creative's Inspire t6160 and t6300 speakers. Such speakers appeared to have decent volume at a reasonable price. However, none of these systems had rear mountable speakers.
I stumbled across the Z906's on the web. At 500 watts and a $300 price tag, these speakers were more than I wanted. However, without spending a whole lot more, I couldn't find any other speakers. I jumped on these speakers and am glad I did. These sound very good and the system has great volume (it's 500 watts, it better...#.
The bass and midrange are pretty good. The bass won't shake the house apart but it's beyond sufficient. The treble maybe a bit weak though. Overall, the sound sounds slightly flat. It's only slightly; I have a really nice sound system in my living room I enjoy listening too and am comparing this unit to. Most people may not notice the sound at all and would consider it great. The 5.1 sound separation on this unit is very good.
The amplifier has DTS and Dolby Digital Decoding built-in and some basic features. It can take stereo input and make it sound almost 5.1 as an example. It has 5 inputs #multiple optical, analog, stereo, etc.# and an aux. What this means is you can hook a TV/Blu-Ray, computer, console and other items up at the same time. One hole in the inputs maybe a lack of HDMI but that's no biggy.
A nice remote comes with the system allowing volume change as well as changing the input source.
The overall build quality of this system is very good as well; everything appears to be well made and gives me the impression it will last a while.
The only complaints I have are relatively minor. One item has to deal with speaker levels. This setup has the ability to adjust volume levels of speakers relative to each other but not all individual speakers. You can adjust the back speakers relative to the other speakers, but you can't adjust each back speaker individually, as an example.
The second complaint comes with the ability to wall mount the speakers. All speakers in this setup are wall mountable, except the subwoofer of course, which is nice. However, no mounting hardware comes with the system. All you get is a center screw hole dead center on the back of each speaker. But what's worse still is the documentation doesn't tell you what size bolts will go inside the holes nor is the weight of the speakers mentioned so you can pick appropriate wall mounts #I think they are 3.3 lbs but not sure). I purchased a set of Pinpoint's AM-30 Universal wall mounts. Luckily, these had a bolt which would fit the Logitech Speakers. However, I was a bit worried as I guessed these mounts would work. Logitech should have provided the specs on the speakers when it comes to mounting them.
Ultimately, this speaker system is a pretty good unit with a decent feature set, well made components, more than ample volume, and good to great but not fantastic sound. These are far better than cheap $100 systems but are still inexpensive enough not to break the bank. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give this unit a 9.

35853342 I used this headset daily to play mmos, watch moives and everyday things you do on the computer. I love the sound and I really enjoy listening to music on these headphones. The mic is a different story, when using the mic sometimes you don't sound clear. Some would describe it like a fish bowl effect when I talk. I know another person who uses the same set I do but she bought hers 6mos before I got mine. Hers works fine for the most part. I have only had mine for about 3 mos. Over all this is a good headset if you are a beginner gamer or need a cheap headset thats going to last 6mons or more.

35853342 I have used it for over 2 weeks now. It has handled being thrown in a back pack and taken to work daily. Battery life has already exceeded my previous mouse by 4 days, and counting. Buttons show no sign of wearing out anytime soon.

..

35853342 Excellent product. We have not experienced any problems with the product. It is well worth the price.

..

35853342 This is my second M310 - the first has a permanent home with my laptop. For ease of installation and use, it's hard to beat. I see no point in having to install ancillary software, and you don't need to here. Plug in the USB gizmo, take out the battery tag and you're done.

..

35853342 Sales person very cooperative. Never tried to sell me something I did not need. Great Geek squad member!

..

35853342 It's a wireless mouse. Plug and play. No issue. Small USB connection.

..

35853342 Great mouse for the price. It's very easy to install the USB blue tooth. Very easy to use

..

35853342 Very nice mouse with a great "feel" and rolling and clicking is very smooth. Would highly recommend.

..

35853342 I like the Mouse in lieu of using my finger to navigate. Have arthritis in my hands and this is just more convenient for me.

..

35853342 It works alright but is a bit too bulky for me but it does the job for now

35853342 My husband and I are helping raise our beautiful grandchildren who are 6, 3 & 2 years of age. We take turns watching them play outside. In today's society we refuse to leave them out alone. This security system is amazing, I wish we would have thought of it sooner. Easy set up, easy instructions and great picture on the monitor. The only drawback is that it only comes with one camera. It was important to me to post this review as I use reviews always before buying products and I find them very helpful. A must have if you have children who like to spend time outside playing.......oh, and I forgot to mention not only can you see them, you can hear them to because it has a built in speaker!! Amazing, now I can be productive in the home while watching the children on the monitor. Very happy!

..

35853342 This is my first home security monitoring system. It works great overall and, for me, was easy to install. The unit came with one camera which I mounted outside under the roof over my deck to monitor my driveway. I ended up purchasing an additional camera and may purchase another. Overall this is a great little security system for the money. The unit comes with a 2Gb SD card for recording and will accept up to a 32Gb SDHD card. However, it did not accept a Kingston SDHD. It did accept a Scandisk. The only real drawback for me is that I would like to have about 20 to 30 feet more with the night vision. It does, however, work fairly well within the advertised range. A easy, simple to install and use home security monitoring entry level system well worth the money.

..

35853342 I bought this setup to monitor my mares when they are close to foaling. It was the easiest to setup, I went and screwed the camera to the wall and plugged it in then went inside and turned the receiver on. The receiver automatically picked up the camera and was good to go. I have not tried the Skype feature yet, but you can hook up the receiver to the tv and have, in our case a 72" picture which is pretty cool. The mare has automatic light timers on and the picture is very clear in the light and in the dark. Camera switches over well. I am not very technologically savvy and this was a breeze. I have read other reviews on the model with the 9" receiver that the cameras are not weatherproof just weather resistant. I have the camera in the barn but when it gets down to -20 degrees, the barn gets pretty cold too. With just putting the cameras up March 5th, I have avoided the cold weather. That will be the true test to see if they hold up to Indiana weather. Other than that, I extremely recommend this system for anyone to use. It is working great for us and I plan on putting more cameras up to monitor the horses.

..

35853342 Fits great with the iPad mini retina. Tried the Targus iPad mini and because my mini is the retina it did not fit the Targus.

..

35853342 Bought this case to help protect my wife's ipad. It does the job.

..

35853342 I bought this for my daughter to replace one her froend broke. So far it has proved to be durable and the iPad fits well.

..

35853342 I like the product and it serves it purpose. It does take some getting used to because the straps that hold the IPad in the case, get in the way of use the iPad in the upper corners ot the Pad, like the back button on the browser. Also, in order for it the automatic shut off with the cover, the cover has to be placed almost perfectly square on top of the pad.

..

35853342 Cover fits well. Nice color would but again. May txt is too short

..

35853342 Needed a case for my mini. This one looked good and works as a stand in horizontal and vertical orientation. Auto on/off feature is great. Also helps keep my screen from getting too "smudgy".

..

35853342 Not that much protection but I still liked it, really easy to manage

..

35853342 Offers good protection. Can read my iPad mini in either portrait
or landscape orientation and prop up at more than one angle.

..

35853342 It's a nice case, but I don't like how the top doesn't secure. It would be nice so that way it doesn't fly open all the time.

..

35853342 This case was for my daughter's ipad mini. Perfect choice as it looks good, functions well, can prop/stand up your ipad for easy viewing and it swivels between portait and landscape. It was a bit more than I wanted to spend but very happy with it.

..

35853342 Picked it up when my co-workers started to get CT and tendinitis from long hours. I'm fingertip user and this prevents me from having a "death grip" on the sides, reducing strain.
It's a bit noisy on the table once the sliders were broken in. Buttons are getting a little warn in.
It is a bit heavy, and I don't feel as quick with it as other mice.
The fabric covered cable is a nice touch.

..

35853342 I had bought this mouse for mmo, video game shooters, etc. It was working fine then all of sudden the mouse cursor would no longer keep tracking. Its as if the optics of the system are faulty and are not registering the mouse movement with the cursor.
I have decided to go back to my default mouse that came with my computer which works way better. do yourself a favor and find a better mouse! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

..

35853342 Great gaming mouse, lots of great pitons for gaming and business use.

..

35853342 RAT 3 works without issue but the RAT 7 scrolls sporadically around the screen at random intervals. Definitely a huge problem. Loved the predecessor.

..

35853342 I got this mouse to use with my Mac Mini. It does work good but some of the buttons are useless on my mac. The mouse feels great and looks even better. I like how the cable is rope like.

..

35853342 Overall this is a well designed product, with one caveat. On the right and left sides there are two metal screws holding parts in place. In dry weather, when there is a lot of static electricity, I have to remember to ground myself before touching the mouse, otherwise my static buildup will transfer into the mouse and it will stop functioning.

..

35853342 I know this is a gaming mouse but I primarily use it for business; drafting and design.

..

35853342 This is an awesome item for anyone that spends the majority of their time on a computer at work either from home or for a company. Especially, if you have repetitive, constant movement while using desktop or laptop.

..

35853342 25-6400 dpi. 3 programable settings + Precision aim mode. 6 programable buttons. Adjust it for the size of your hand. Adjust the weight. Thumb rest & Braided cable.
Had my 1st. one almost 2 yrs 'til the Left, R.A.T. button mechanism gave in & started sticking. THANK GOODNESS FOR BESTBUY EXTENDED WARRANTY

..

35853342 Overall this is a great mouse. The left / right buttons are large and easy to click and the scroll wheel is well placed with a good feel to it. Having large hands it is very hard to find a mouse that fits. I purchased this mouse mainly for its customizable features in hopes for a well fitting mouse. Most adjustable features expand to fit except for the overall length: it could really be lengthened longer for large hands but stops a little short in this area. This should not be a problem for most hands. The side scroll wheel is a very hand feature I use all the time. The thumb button positions are not adjustable and are low for my large thumb, but again this should not be a problem for most hands. The programmable software is easy to use and you can have multiple profiles which is real handy. The sensitivity is adjustable on the fly with a button right behind the main scroll wheel and also in software.
The bottom line is I would buy this mouse again and recommend it to friends.

..

35853342 it connects and then stops working, while my computer still says it's connected. weird...

..

35853342 I bought this keyboard because it was half the price of the Apple keyboard.Unfortunately, you get what you pay for. The keys stick and I have to type pretty hard to get all keys to register. The keyboard takes about 5 seconds to register when I turn my computer on too. It is a $25 keyboard and this is why Apple can charge $60.

METRA 44UA200 High Performance Amplified Antenna


..

35853342 This universal antenna is not at all what you people say it is. The reception with this devise totally sucks! Would not recommend it to anyone especially for what the thing costs! Very disappointed with this thing. Not even heavy enough to use for a paper weight!

..

35853342 I have a Toyota with an amplified rear glass antenna. I always got great reception with my factory stereo, but when I installed an Alpine receiver with HD radio I could not pull hardly any stations in. I installed this antenna above my rear view mirror, and problem solved. Now I get about as good of signal as I would expect and finally can put my HD radio tuner to work. The only problem I had was that the antenna cable was short. Luckily I had an extension, so it all worked out.

Plus, you can wander up to 30 feet away and retain the wireless connection to your computer.


..

35853342 I bought this in November and by January the receiver did not work, which meant we could not use the keyboard or mouse and it could not be reinstalled. It could not be returned, because it was past the 30 day return mark. I bought this one because I thought it would be a good brand that would last. I was not happy at all.

..

35853342 I replaced a similar Logitech mouse/keyboard pair with the Microsoft 3000, and I've been very pleased with the upgrade. The Microsoft pair was less expensive, and I prefer the replacement batteries to Logitech's rechargeable batteries on the mouse. With the totally wireless USB connection (there was an AC adapter for Logitech's USB connection on my PC), the Microsoft setup is far superior in my opinion. The rubber on the mouse wheel and the legs on the keyboard ended up breaking/failing after about 2 years, but I'm actually looking to replace them with the exact same product, so good was my experience with this product, in spite of that shortcoming.

..

35853342 I purchased this set about 18 months ago. I have used it 5-6 days a week since then. I can't recall changing the batteries but once in the keyboard, and maybe a few times in the mouse. I really like this set for the price. I am a little dissapointed that I have to buy another one, the mouse is only working intermitantly, there is a problem with the shutoff switch on the bottom.

..

35853342 So far have not had any major concerns. Battery life has been good.

..

35853342 Opened the box and everything seemed fine. Used it for 2 days and things on both the keyboard and mouse either broke or quit working. The prop leg on the bottom of the keyboard broke off the first time I opened it and the mouse wheel decided to only work when it wanted to.

..

35853342 I run multiple computers sharing a single monitor and always keep at least 2 of these at my desk. Ther are easy a quick to connect and light and easy to move out of the way. I have used other brands and these are the best I have used.

..

35853342 best keyboard mouse i have ever owned and i have had a lot of keyboards some don't last long others don't reach the expectations but this one hit the nail on the head perfect

..

35853342 I bought this to go with a Mac Mini. It took a bit of fiddling to get the Mac functions working, but it was worth the effort. It is a great keyboard and mouse. I am a writer so I need a good keyboard for extensive typing, and this fits the bill.

..

35853342 The key board and mouse look cool and are comfortable to use. It does have a signal issue if you are an iPhone user. If you leave your phone in the proximity of the keyboard and walk way for 1-2 minutes it will drop the signal from your computer and you have to remove a battery for a moment and put it back in to reset. This happens to me multiple times a day. Other than that it works fine.

..

35853342 Installs quick and easy, don't need CD if running Win 7. As stated above great keyboard, good features and hot keys etc... Mouse is lousey, sketchy and bouncy/all over the place rediclous. Fix was to kill mouse and use other BT mouse, and it works fine. For the price both should work...

All you have to do is plug the USB into the computer and you are ready to play. It's a nice controller and I am happy with the purchase.

..

6006839700003 It was so great to find a calculator at a reasonable price that prints out yur calculations. However, it was very difficult loading the paper. Since I could not get it in, I asked a friend who had the same problem but we finally got it in. Ity took about thiry minutes whicxh is WAY too long. Also the paper stand is not that stable and you have to hold the paper on if yoou are going to move the calculator. other than that I was glad to finally get onew that actually works, SO FAR! ;)

Prepare delicious fried foods with this Chef Buddy 82-DF35 3-1/2-liter deep fryer that features 265-375 temperature control to suit a variety of food items and an extra-large frying basket for whipping up plenty of tasty treats.


..

6006839700003 I am overall very please with it. This deep fryer has been a great add-on to my experience as a home chef. I love to cook and this brings more joy to the experience. I would definitely tell anyone out there looking for a deep fryer to buy this one. For the price it is excellent. cleaning is simple, and little maintenance.

Make delicious waffles, panini sandwiches, pizza pockets and more with this Chef Buddy 80-SM15 3-in-1 press that features 3 sets of detachable heating plates for flexible use and dual heating zones for fast cooking.


..

6006839700003 Was extremely disappointed with the poor heating for the waffle attachments. After several minutes, the waffles were not getting crispy. They stayed very soft and did not brown enough. Would not recommend this product.

..

6006839700003 Pros:
Occupies less space as you need just this one to make 3 different things like panini, toast sandwich and waffles.
Well built!
Buffed metal mordern look.
Cons:
Initially I got the unit and within a week the plates in the top compartment were no more holding. It has a clip that clicks when you insert the plate in top and bottom compartment.
I called customer care and they replaced the unit for free. Very satisfied. May be that particular unit was bad. Another one which was replaced works just perfect.
Sometimes I feel it just heats only center part of the plates (particularly sandwich maker plates). So some parts get brown or over toasted as compared to edges, but it is minor thing which I guess can be overlooked considering the price, effeciency of 3 in 1 and great customer support.
The instruction manual says red and green light when heating up and ready. Does not auto shut off when cooked or auto regulate the temperature (I am assuming). I never tried to cook it for longer time and see if burns but based on instruction it looks like it does not have any of such auto feature.
Overall a good product.

..

6006839700003 This panini maker is excellent for lunches, it's very quick and doesn't burn all my food, unless you forget about it.

..

6006839700003 A little slow, the waffles are ready about 7. Minutes ,, I prefered use my old waffle maker . But I like it for the sandwich and panini ..no for waffles

..

6006839700003 Easy to use and clean, and great quality deliveries

Enjoy delicious grilled meats and tasty toasted sandwiches with this Chef Buddy 80-1840 grill and panini press that features dual heating zones for quick, efficient cooking. The nonstick interior makes cleanup easy.


..

6006839700003 This item doesn't really feel heavy duty. It does look like the picture, and it work fine. We only use for breakfast sandwiches and small stuff. Great product for the value, bit if the use is heavier than mine I recommend getting one more heavy duty.

6006839700003 
Make tasty breakfast sandwiches at home with this Chef Buddy 82-Y3496 microwave egg cooker that holds up to 2 eggs and lets you cook an egg patty in as little as 45 seconds. The polypropylene plastic material provides durability.


..

6006839700003 The product is very convenient. Easy to clean and saves time. Simple to prepare scrambled or poached. However the unit is fragile and I am still wondering why it is priced the way it is

..

6006839700003 Not quite what I expected, much smaller on the outside, looks like a cheap product.

..

6006839700003 I love the microwave egg cooker. No mess, unless you don't mix the eggs well, and fluffy when they are finished. We love egg sandwiches and they fit hamburger buns exactly. Clean up is a breeze and they are dishwasher safe.

..

6006839700003 I used to use frying pan to cook the egg every morning. It takes time to warm up the pan and have to use bit oil since the non-stick pan start to stick after a year or two. This microwave egg cooker is so great that it cooks quickly (about one min) and doesn't need any oil. The egg comes out clean and easily. I love it very much. Only complaint is (I think) it is priced bit high for something so simple. But I am still a happy customer.

..

6006839700003 I just spray a little cooking spray in the center and spread it around with a piece of paper towel then break the egg into the cooker and beat it. Close the lid and cook for 50 seconds and it come out perfect for an muffin or a "Breakfast Jack". My oven is only 1000 Watts so if yours is 1100 try a shorter time. Washes clean in seconds with a soapy sponge. I broke the top off of mine right out of the box but it doesn't matter, you can just lay it on top as they don't latch or anything.
If you want to do an egg without scrambling it you still need to scramble the yolk a little and put a small plate on top of the lid because it will pop up a bit when the yolk starts to cook. I love this because I'm too lazy to clean up a pan and a bowl just to get an egg, this way I can have one anytime I want to. In less than 2 minutes the cooking and clean up are done.

Make sure you use the best AA RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES in this camera. Playback video volume is weak to hear from the camera itself.
However, playback on the TV, volume can be adjusted louder.

This classic desk phone features a 1930s European design that captures the sophisticated look of yesterday. A mechanical bell in the base incorporates the original phone's design into today's contemporary model.


..

6006839700003 Twice I have purchased this phone; first from Best Buy; then from Amazon. BOTH TIMES the first product arrived in a defective condition (the first time one could not get a connection at all through the set; the second phone has a defective handset preventing the user from being heard by the party called). The first time, I called and got Crosley to replace the phone, but I had to pay shipping. This time, I have called SEVEN TIMES over more than TWO WEEKS; each time the nice phone receptionists have promised that technical services would call me back within two business days. It hasn't happened once.

6006839700003 My wife wanted an old fashion desk phone and this fit the bill perfectly

..

6006839700003 I love this phone. I needed a new phone for a bedroom and did not want the typical cordless variety. This phone is so retro and looks great next to a four-poster bed. The sound quality is excellent and far exceeds the price of the phone.

..

6006839700003 This Desk Phone looks great in my home office! I love it. I was looking for something that would be a little different than your typical phone and this defintiely fits. It works great, perfect for what I need. I have had no problems with the phone thus far and would reccomend this to anyone looking for a phone and an excellent home decor piece.

..

6006839700003 I have had restored old phones in the past that looked great but had terrible sound quality for both ends of the call. This reproduction phone looks great but you can hear well on it and the push button technology is great. I liked it so much I bought a second in chrome. I am an antique dealer and live in an old house so this phone is the best of both worlds- looks great but has modern technology. Only thing I don't know is if it is durable-have only had it a couple of weeks.

..

6006839700003 Probably a good product, but we specifically wanted the more authentic cloth-type straight "corded" phone as pictured and described on the web site. Phone delivered had the squiggly pig-tail cord, with no provision for retrofitting.
On the plus side, return was easily accomplished in-store.

The PS Vita is the next generation in portable gaming, changing how you connect and play. The 25 in 1 Luxury Kit for the PS Vita from CTA Digital provides all the amenities and protection that no PS Vita owner should be without. This extensive accessory kit comes equipped with all the essential items allowing you to fully enjoy your Vita, and keep it protected while you're traveling.


..

6006839700003 First off, this comes with all the necessary accessories. The charge/data cables with wall/car adapters are nice to have as spares as are the extra screen protectors. The core value resides in the hard case with doubles as a secure way to game on the go. I tend to go with crystal case all the time, but swap it out for the grip case if I'm playing for longer stretches. The crystal case stand is nice but could've been better. It's useless if you use headphones and/or charge cable as they sit the vita off of the stand. The PSP crystal case had a metal bar from near the top of the back so it had more of an incline, which would've supported the plugged in cables.
The added pick stylus's are a nice touch! It laughably comes with a long lanyard for your neck...I have no clue who would think it to be a good idea to strap a vita around your neck. The game cases are good too. You get more than you need in the end, even with the limited crystal case and extra accessories. A must buy forany new Vita owners!

..

6006839700003 There are many keyboards to choose from with more features than this one, but hey! features don't necessarily equal benefits. I've been using this keyboard daily for 3 months and am extremely impressed. When your running and gunning; sneaking and peaking; gimmicks won't help you! This keyboard delivers where it counts: excellent responsive, well spaced, comfortable keys that simply feel and sound right. That's what is fundamentally required in a gaming keyboard, everything else is just flash. The keyboard is solid and stays put. The materials and construction appear to be top flight. What else do you need? How about red adjustable back lighting and an extendable wrist rest? Its there!

..

6006839700003 I have been using this keyboard for months and have been quite satisfied with it. It has excellent built quality. The keys press incredibly soft, and the Backlighting works very well. If you are in the market for a good gaming keyboard that will hold up then this is your best choice.

..

6006839700003 I got this keyboard for BF:BC 2 and the recent realease of SC2 and i am absolutely loving it so far. The backlighting is just bright enough and is not uneven until you get to around the edges. I tested how well this keyboard dealt with ghosting and i could press up to 6 KEYS at once until it couldnt detect any more!!! Overall way better than my keyboard that came with the computer i got.

..

6006839700003 I had to write the review, because I kept buying really lousy and expensive keyboards and they were not comfortable and would break immediately. The keys on this keyboard are very pleasant, and really easy to type on. Even the red light is not annoying, it helps to see the letters better. I was looking for a good keyboard for so long that I owe you guys to let you know that this keyboard might be the one for you too... :)

..

6006839700003 Decisions, decisions, decisions. I wanted an illuminated keyboard. Process of elimination brought the contestants down to Logitech Illuminated keyboard vs. Saitek Cyborg V.5. Eventually we went with the Saitek because of the $30.00 price difference and that the keyboard would not be in a publicly viewed area.
If you are wondering about the performance of the Saitek keyboard, the keys are smooth with gentle stops yet very responsive. It elevates to 1.5" in the back (or can be flush) and with the included palm rest, is almost ergonomic comfortable. The letters can light up with two levels of intensity or be turned off. Compared to the Logitech, the draw-back of this system is; the area under the keys is allowed to be red-lit. That will seem tacky to some, awesome to others.
Having purchased this, I can now say this is a keyboard I want to have rather than a 'make do' board. Logitech's board is pretty, this one is functional. And, if you are into gaming with a keyboard, it is fully customizable. I would strongly urge you to go to www.saitek.com and check out their manuals and profiles. Seems like a really good deal for that type of use.
NOTE*** There is no CD/DVD in the packaging. You have to go to www.saitek.com to download the drivers (but then you always get the most current, no having to run updates).

..

6006839700003 This keyboard features a red LED set up that can be turned off. It has a removeable wrist rest. The numbers and letters are lit in red and provides great night vision. It's legs can be adjusted under neither for high or low. The keys are not hard to push and they aren't loud at all when you type. This keyboard also features a mute key, low volume key, high volume key, and a light adjustment key. The keyboard itself isn't large in width. It's actually pretty small and portable.

..

6006839700003 it lights up red that's cool and helps at night and u can turn the light on and off whenever u want its nice but it could be a little brighter at the bottom tho and i wrote this review with it and the keys on it r really nice there quiet and not cheap feeling

..

6006839700003 I made this Saitek keyboard an addition to my Alienware PC. I figured the name "cyborg" that is branded on it was a good match for my computer. I buy keyboards like women buy shoes. I probably should have waited and purchased a version that has blue lit keys to match the blue lights that illuminate from my Alienware. But, then again, there's nothing wrong with a little contrast.
Yeah, this is the bottom of the line keyboard for Saitek, however, it still gets the job done. Being a hard-core PC gamer, I'm able to program the keys to perform various functions for actions to be performed in my games.
You don't get the drivers with this keyboard. One has to go to Saitek.com to snag them. Drivers are available for all genres of Windows, including Windows 7 (though I'm using Windows XP Pro Media Edition). Sounds like a down fall, but it's not. There's no telling how long a product has sat on the shelves, thus, by being required to download the drivers, pretty much presents the opportunity to download the most current drivers for that item.
I'm also an avid keyboardist, clocking in over 120 wpm. This soft-touch keyboard allows me to fly through documents I create, without having to wonder if I actually hit a particular key with enough pressure.
The design of the keyboard is rather unique as well. It's not your typical rectangular keyboard. If I were to change anything about this keyboard, I would add a better wrist wrest. Also, considering this is a lighted keyboard, I would, as the manufacturer, light up the Cyborg name found on this keyboard as well.

..

6006839700003 I was only looking for a keyboard with backlit keys and this product is just that. The only downside is, the particular keyboard I bought doesn't seem to light up evenly across the entire keyboard( such as the function keys ). The alpha and numeric keys are nice and bright but you can't say that for the rest. I hope that this may just be an issue with my particular keyboard but if that is just how this product is manufactured, it's a bit lacking.

This DENAQ DQ-PA-12-7450 AC adapter charges select Dell laptops by harnessing 65W to deliver a steady stream of power to your device. Smart technology communicates accurate information to your laptop for efficient performance.


..

6006839700003 Try to charge my computer and it did not work. Wrong information listed on details of product.

..

6006839700003 The DENAQ -AC power adapter is replacing the original adapter provided by DELL with my Inspiron 6000

..

6006839700003 Pretty good charger for low price. Very simple to set up. Arrived to my home in about a week.

..

6006839700003 I have had to buy 3 AC adapters in the last 3 years for my laptop because the cords get frayed over time, I don't want to spend very much on them. WIth a Dell you can't use just any old AC Adapter so it's great that I can get one at Best Buy for a fraction of the cost of a Dell AC Adapter. Very happy.

..

6006839700003 Needed an AC adapter to replace missing adapter for Laptop. Thought I'd give it a try and it seemed reasonably priced. Works great and it is a snug fit so I don't have to worry about it pulling out when the cord is stretched a little too far

..

6006839700003 This works in that it is able to give power to my Dell. It does not, however, fit snugly into the socket on the computer like the original does. For the price, and for a backup computer, this fits my need.

..

6006839700003 The cord was initially difficult to push all the way in, but after pushing it back and forth sideways a few times, it wedged itself on in. Guess it was just a tight fit. Once accomplished, it has worked like a charm, and the tight fit will assure it does not come unplugged.

Experience crisp, clear picture quality while watching your favorite movies and television shows with this Elite Screens Spectrum Series ELECTRIC100V 100" motorized projector screen that features black backing for vibrant color reproduction.


..

6006839700003 I am fortunate enough to have the space for this size screen. The image projected are of very good quality and clarity. This is my first projector for home theater and the screen is very good. There are other options available but this is the right one for the home and at a good price.

..

6006839700003 Is excelent to have this for movie theather at home.

..

6006839700003 Well I've got everything installed with it's own outlet but the screen is not functioning at this point. Will get web tech support on the first school day and hopefully we can get things working. Then I'll have a little better review to report

..

6006839700003 This product is great. If you are looking for a motorized screen this is the one. It can be mounted on a wall, or a ceiling. Even though it takes a long time for the screen to come down, it does't make a lot of noise

GE Nickel Cadmium Cordless Phone Battery - Nickel-Cadmium (NiCd) - 700mAh - 3.6V DC


..

6006839700003 My cordless phone/answering machine went "dead", so I knew I needed a new battery. Ordered this one thru Best Buy and received it as promised. Phone works again, everyone's happy! As a matter of fact, I just ordered a second battery for my parents...they have the same cordless phone and I've noticed that their old battery is starting to fade out as well.

Defend your Samsung Galaxy S 4 on the go with this Griffin Technology Reveal GB37801 hard shell case that features a 1-piece polycarbonate shell for optimal protection. The play-through design lets you access your phone's ports and controls.

6006839700003 Overall this is a nice cover. My phone is blue and it shows through the back.

Ridiculously over-engineered? Or the perfect case no matter where you're headed? We think it's a little bit of both. Simply put, Survivor is the most protective case we've ever built. Designed and tested to meet or exceed US Department of Defense Standard 810F, Griffin's Survivor Extreme-Duty Case is built from the inside out to protect your iPhone from extreme conditions ... dirt, sand, rain, shock, vibration and a host of other environmental factors. Survivor is built on a shatter-resistant polycarbonate frame clad in rugged, shock-absorbing silicone. A built-in screen protector seals your Multi-Touch display from the outside environment, while hinged plugs seal the dock connector, headphone port, hold switch and volume controls. A detachable heavy-duty clip secures your iPhone to a belt or bag strap. How well does Survivor perform? You can view videos and test results online at


..

6006839700003 I really like this case because it is very durable and has a built in screen. However as a result it's much heavier and bulkier, harder to fit in a pocket. I must stress that it is not waterproof!

..

6006839700003 Purchased on sale at Best Buy. Offers GREAT protection. I would definitely buy another. Ports and camera are relatively easy to access.

..

6006839700003 Very good product and great value! I especially like that it's waterproof.

..

6006839700003 Was cheap, should have let me know from the start it wasn't for me. When on the belt clip, it leaves the phone screen facing the front. That is a stupid design. Then it makes you sound muffled when you are talking to someone.

..

6006839700003 Good case,but it makes the phone too big to fit in your pocket

..

6006839700003 its durable, keeps phone safe, but hard to use the added features on the iPhone5s with its attached camera cover, the covered thumb-button and hard to open volume control.

..

6006839700003 don't like the moisture that gathers between the zagg shield on my phone and the shield that comes with the case

..

6006839700003 If you don't work in an office and do a lot of walking this is the one for you. Not good in pocket but in its clip it's secure.

..

6006839700003 Great product. Works fantastic. Would purchase again.

..

6006839700003 Great protection for my iPhone. It was very reasonably priced which made it even more appealing. It has a built in screen saver as well. My wife has a LifeProof case but I think this one is almost as good; just a bit bulkier...

..

6006839700003 
Protect your Samsung Galaxy S 4 cell phone from harsh environmental factors with this Griffin Technology Survivor GB37805 case that features a shatter-resistant polycarbonate frame and silicone cladding to prevent damage due to shocks and drops.


..

6006839700003 This is a nice looking case. Quality construction. waterproof. it is so tight you can not hear your phone when the case is on

..

6006839700003 The sizes of cases don't bother me because I love knowing that my phone is protected and if that means a big case then so be it. But even I would say this case is a little big. Its bigger than the Otterbox defender which people complain about because they think that is big. But when it comes to protection this case is amazing. It is very good at keeping your device protected and clean and I love how if it accidentally fell I wouldn't need to worry about it at all. It won't fit in a pocket, but it will fit in a purse or bag and even then you wouldn't need to worry about your keys or anything else scratching it up. The only downside this case has that really bothered me was the sound quality. You will definitely notice the difference. I don't listen to music on my phone so that wasn't the issue but calling or receiving calls was terrible. The person on the other line couldn't hear me at all and i would barely hear them even with the volume all the way up. There is an easy fix to this which is just punching out the black "paper" things covering the ports where your speaker is and everything else. That way it'll all be open and the sound will be just fine but then your case loses the water resistant ability seeing how all the ports would now be open. But if that doesn't bother you then like i said its an easy fix for the sound quality. Your phone fits nice and snug in the case so you wont hear it bouncing around in there and you wont have to worry about it coming out if you were to drop it. I would recommend this case to a friend if they need really good protection and don't mind a big case.

..

6006839700003 Awesome case! Have used this type of case for other electronics and you can't go wrong with it.

Griffin Black Survivor Skin Protective Case for iPhone 5/5s - iPhone - Black


..

6006839700003 This skin is easier to hold than some others that I have tried. Protects my iPod from scratches and dings nicely.

..

6006839700003 Fits and protects well. Good case for the money. Would recommend

..

6006839700003 My daughter poured this out for her new iPod. She loved the color choice and it protects it well.

..

6006839700003 Works great easy to use and comes with a protective shield

..

6006839700003 Really liked this cover. Selected it because my son has gone through three different iTouch covers and the plastic ones black and the gorilla ones are hard to press the surface with my large fingers. This one does the job!

..

6006839700003 I just need something to cover my device. It offers everything I need in a cover for and easily screen cracking device. So far I have sat it in my lap in the car and forgot went to step out and it fell and my device in still in tact.

..

6006839700003 Bought it for my son, it def protects the iPod which I love, however it doesn't fit perfectly.

..

6006839700003 With this I don't have to worry about getting scratches on my iPod - love it!

..

6006839700003 Good product. Easy to install. The color is useful anytime my son misplaces the item.

..

6006839700003 Excellent case for the 5th generation ipod touch! It has a snug fit.

Hamilton Beach 26050 Waffle Maker - Belgian Waffle - 4 x


..

6006839700003 This waffle maker was just what we were looking for. Stylish, easy to use, quick setup. Cooks the waffle as we expected. The easy clean up was just a bonus for us.

..

6006839700003 My kids and I love this waffle maker. We always have delicious waffles staying at hotels and this maker reminds me of just that....It did take a few tries to figure out how to get the waffles to be perfect but now we love it!!

..

6006839700003 Took a little time to get the perfect waffle as this is much different than the other waffle maker I used. I like how easy this one is to clean with the removal plates.

..

6006839700003 This was a gift to my family. They love waffles. And now they can make any time and not have to go to a restaurant to enjoy their favorite breakfast.

..

6006839700003 Easy to setup, store and clean. Makes good waffles. I am used to the irons that make 4 square waffles with little holes. This waffle iron makes big thick waffles and the kids don't enjoy them as much as the old waffle iron. But can't complain about the ease of clean up. With both top and bottom irons popping out and being dishwasher safe... that makes it worth it right there.

..

6006839700003 Great price! Easy to use, easy to clean, easy to store. The waffles are true Belgian waffles thick fluffy and delicious. After making them, I remove the plates, place them in the dishwasher. Easy clean. I ordered the waffle maker on Sunday and received it just a few days later. I am pleased with Best Buy and this quality waffle maker

..

6006839700003 It uses more batter than the hotel waffle irons and makes a light, fluffy waffle with nice crispiness with some brands of mix, and a heavy brick of a waffle with others. I've found that trying to get a consistently thinnish batter helps.
It would be nice if the irons could be reversed for sandwiches. Older models frequently were multi-purposed like that.

..

6006839700003 Anyone can use this product to make a great waffle.

..

6006839700003 easy to use and super easy to clean!! i've never used a waffle iron before and they came out perfect!!

..

6006839700003 I bought this waffle maker for my parents and they really like it. The waffles come out fluffy on the inside but slightly crispy on the outside. Flipping is good and the grids and tray are very easy to clean. We only wish it had an audible tone to tell us when the waffle is done cooking but we can live without that feature.

..

6006839700003 
Featuring bake, broil and toast settings, a bake pan and a broil rack, this Hamilton Beach 31510 toaster oven makes it easy to cook a variety of delicious dishes. The cooking area holds 6 slices of bread, a 6-lb. chicken, a 7-lb. roast or a 9" pizza.


..

6006839700003 Replaced an older Black and Decker Toaster oven. Has the same inside capacity but takes up less counter space

..

6006839700003 As stated I wasn't looking to have the toaster oven do more than toast and use as a small oven for reheats. Kind of a pain for the toast timer. But can live with it.

..

6006839700003 good product for the money. I would reccomend this product to a friend.
overall rating is good

..

6006839700003 my daughter had one and she said I would love it and I do.

..

6006839700003 I took it back to the Hwy 280 store 2 days after delivery because door would not stay closed. Clerk said he could not fix.I was told I could not order another one because no store had it. Only 1 toaster in store was EuroPro $10 less. I did not want It. It does not look nice. It is not stainless like I ordered and I keep having to unplug it because timer knob does not work right. I am unhappy
about both toasters! You just sent this to my email acct and then want my
Email at the bottom? Customer service & sm appliance men very nice!

..

6006839700003 Sizewise, this cannot replace a full-size oven. It will not fit a full pizza, for example. However, its size means it heats up faster than a full-size oven. It's convenient for reheating food but not ideal for baking.
I can't speak for the durability because I haven't used it extensively yet. However, when I first received the oven, the baking pan (included) had been severely scratched and I had to ship the oven back to the manufacturer for a replacement pan.
The one-foot cord is very short for "safety reasons," as stated by the manual, so an extension cord or a nearby outlet is a must.
I got this oven as part of Best Buy's price-match program; otherwise, the price would have been much higher.

..

6006839700003 Great value for a good looking toaster oven. You do need to position the racks more towards the center of the oven if you want the bread to toast evenly.

..

6006839700003 It is great buy except I don't like that is does not have an auto shut off option so I use the timer which I don't feel has a long enough option. I find that I use it a lot more than expected.

..

6006839700003 Great buy, very happy. Wish I had purchased earlier- would've saved so much energy! We cook something everyday now and it takes 1/10th the time. Happy customer:)

..

6006839700003 Been awhile since I had a toaster oven missed the usefulness. I recommend this oven. My only complaint is that when removed from the box it had a small dent on top right edge....and dials were not clean as I would expect of a new product.

Fill these freezer bowls with fresh ingredients, and in minutes, you can serve two delicious homemade treats. It's so easy a child can do it! To get you started, it comes with six simple recipes for ice cream, frozen yogurt, and sorbet.


..

6006839700003 Ordered for my daughter birthday, was very excited, I did freeze bowls overnight, but the mixing part was not moving and the machine is totally dead. Now, After I paid $8 shipping, all the ingredients(another $15) i am more then just disappointed, as of what do I say to the kid????

..

6006839700003 I love the idea of an ice cream maker that makes soft serve quickly and in small batches. Unfortunately, the product relies upon the frozen bowl to freeze the ice cream. If the bowl does not work, then the product is useless. I was very excited to try this product and washed the bowls as instructed and put them in the freezer. I used it once yesterday with good results and then re-washed and re-froze the bowls to use again today. When I went to take the bowls out of the freezer, one of the bowls has a huge crack in the plastic. I contacted the company to see if they will replace the bowl under warranty, but right now I am really disappointed.

Brew a fresh cup of coffee directly into your cup or travel mug with this Hamilton Beach Stay or Go Personal Cup 49990 pod coffeemaker that features a built-in stand to make filling easy. The dishwasher-safe brew basket enables quick cleanup.


..

6006839700003 Great little coffee maker. However I have already upgraded to the flex brew model which allows use with the k cups.

..

6006839700003 I really like this coffeemaker. It is very convenient. My only negative comment is regarding the pods that go with it. They are hard to find. I'm going to by a Keurig as soon as financially possible.

..

6006839700003 This is a great single cup coffee maker. It uses pods that are more environmentally friendly that the K-cups.

Customize the look of your HTC One (M8) cell phone with this HTC Double Dip 63-2823-05-BB case that features interchangeable covers to help you achieve a personalized style. Durable material protects your device from damage.


..

6006839700003 This case fits very loosely onto the phone and doesn't feel secure at all. Once the phone is in the case, you can feel it sliding around in the case as you hold it. The look of the case is great, and if it fit snug and securely, without feeling like it is going to break apart or slip out, it would be a good case. Returning case.

Ensure the safety of your Apple iPhone 5 with this iLuv hard shell case that features durable PC and PVC materials and a rubber texture that helps you keep a firm grip on your phone. The Snoopy Sports Series design offers a fun look.


..

6006839700003 Great cover for my phone especially for someone who loves snoopy.

..

6006839700003 Although I love Snoopy, and was excited to see a Snoopy iPhone cover for my new iPhone, I'm a bit disappointed about the fit of the cover. I purchased 5 Snoopy covers from iLuv, and the first one fit fine. The next one, (the one I currently am using), doesn't 'snap' down quite right. Also, in all the cases, the top ridge is a little awkward, as it sits a little longer than the phone. This makes it a bit difficult to pick up, or while using the sleep button on top of the iPhone. It would have been better product design if iLuv had decided to fully cover the top of the phone and add a clicker over the sleep button. Pop one on and feel for yourself. Other than those two minor details, I Love the Snoopy iLuv case.

Give your Samsung Galaxy S 4 a touch of style with this Incipio DualPro SHINE SA-379 case, which features a brushed-aluminum finish for a sleek look. The 2-layer defense with a hard shell exterior helps shield your device against damage.


..

6006839700003 I was looking for a durable metal case to add protection to the cheap, flimsy Galaxy S4 housing (why so cheap and flimsy, Samsung? Guts are good, but body is garbage!). This case fits fairly well (when lining is affixed first, then metal exterior). The price was very reasonable, compared to similar items. Unfortunately, I lose about a bar of service, which, in my town, can mean losing service completely. Also, though my hands are "medium" for a woman, I have trouble grasping and using the Galaxy S4 with one hand -- even without the extra millimeters added by the case. I end up dropping the phone just a little more frequently now. But that is really a very minor complaint - and would be caused by all but the sleekest (and less protective) of cases, anyway....

Tried, true and tested, the iSkin solo case has become the popular choice of iPhone owners seeking dependable surface protection in a soft, durable yet attractive package.Lifetime WarrantyDurable, Flexible and Form-FittingLong LastingIntegrated Volume and Power Button ProtectionVibrant Translucent Color


..

6006839700003 After being happy with a thermopolymer iSkin case for an iPhone 3GS, I decided to purchase 2 more for a couple iPhone 5's. This case has all the advantages of a silicone case (flexible, holds tight to most surfaces) without the main disadvantage (stretches over time). After 3 years with the 3GS, the case held up perfectly. I have now owned the case for the iPhone 5 for nearly a year and equally happy. The nice feature for someone who keeps a phone in their pocket is that while the phone will stick to glossy surfaces like a desk or dashboard, it slides easily in and out of a pocket. Also, the material seems to provide good damage protection. The company does stand by it's products. When I first received the case for the 5, it was a bit too tall (by about 2mm). They responded to my email within a few minutes, explaining that a replacement was on the way.

The Gorillapod SLR-ZOOM is designed with the serious photographer in mind. Its sturdy prehensile legs help achieve a steady shot with your SLR and zoom lenses. It attaches to any standard SLR cameras, video cameras, or even your own tripod head. The Gorillapod SLR-ZOOM can support a whopping six pounds, while still maintaining its compact size.


..

6006839700003 I bought my Joby Gorillapod tripod last year after after I got into biking in nature. I found it to be perfect for shooting pics in nature, taking creative shots, and taking videos. The legs of this tripod are super flexible and sturdy. You can wrap the tripod legs around bike handles, tree branches, road signs, and poles. You can also use it to take awkward shots or group shots when no one else is around to help take the photo. I've often placed this tripod on the back of a chair to take a group shot, used it as an arm extension to take an timed shot (because I'm short), and also wrapped it around a ceiling fan to take auto-timed birds-eye shots of my friends at a party-- this came out very well. This tripod is easy to clean, although it does get scratched easily. I really like that this product comes with a built-in horizontal level--it helps align a lot of my shots. I wish that it also came with a built-in vertical-level to help align upright shots. There is a separate Gorillapod for iPhone and other camera sizes-- unfortunately the mounts are not switchable for iphone so if you want to get a travel-friendly tripod for your iphone you would have to haul around a separate tripod for that.

The screen protector is also of higher quality than I anticipated and the 8.9 screen well, including a punchout for the camera lens. Overall, I wouldn't hesitate to buy this again or recommend it to others.

This universal folio PU leather case can 360 degree rotating, very convenient and comfortable. The kit includes all the essentials to prepare your tablet convenient to use on the go. 


..

40267336 At first, for how inexpensive it is, the stylus and headphones were a great addition for my new Nexus 7 2nd gen. But I soon found out that the case can not be used as a normal travel case for a tablet. The right side (or bottom) of the case does not have a prong, and the other prongs can't hold the tablet in place without it sliding. This lead to an accident a few days ago where it slid right out the unsecured spot and bounced onto the pavement of my driveway and dented the corner of my five day old tablet, and scratching the entire back of it too (luckily I had a military grade screen protector put on the day before). I learned it would as much as it cost to send the case back for a refund. The only thing that keeps this from being a one star is the nice accessories it comes with......But! Do not buy this product!

Heat water quickly with this DeLonghi kMix kettle that features a 54-oz. capacity and a flip-top lid for easy filling. The Sure Grip handle lets you maintain a secure grip while pouring.


..

41191388 I purchased the DeLonghi Kmix for my daughter. The pink color caught my eye and I'm so glad it did! It's a fantastic kettle with an easy opening lid complete will a cool touch spot on top, a nice handle, a window for water level that's big enough to see and the opening is large enough for easy cleaning. Works great , looks great, LOVE IT !

With a 19-bar high-pressure pump, this DeLonghi Nespresso Lattissima Plus EN520R espresso maker lets you enjoy a rich, bold cup of espresso. Cappuccino, latte macchiato, long coffee and hot milk settings allow you to make a range of delicious beverages.


..

41191388 Nespresso does a really good job creating a wide variety of espresso pods to choose from. Each one actually taste different from one another! You can taste the peppery spices in the Indian coffees, and the fruity wine like flavor in the columbian one. They also release limited edition flavors every once in a while to keep things interesting; I can't wait to try the new Ethiopian one!
All the Nespresso machines pull consistently good espresso, but the Lattissima+ is a step above the rest in that it will froth the milk, pull the shot, and literally make you a cappuccino at the push of a button, a-la The Jetsons.
If you get a chance to stop by a Nespresso boutique you should. First just to experience the over-the-top theatrics of the place (it was so awkward!).... but more importantly to try out some of the flavors before you buy them, and save on shipping too!

..

41191388 The machine seems very efficient and exudes quality workmanship. Quick and easy to use.

..

41191388 Overall, my husband and I love our new espresso machine. We tend to make lattes more often than espresso and by picking the right milk to achieve maximum frothiness (surprisingly Parmalat works really well), this machine delivers exceptional results every time. The settings take a while to get right - the temperature, how much to put in your cup etc; but once you figure that out, this machine is worth the investment.

..

41191388 It was a purchase for my wife at Christmas. We both love it and it's so easy to use. Clean up is quick and easy.

..

41191388 Truly a great product that is accented by its great coffees and their unique vacuumed sealed process. Suggestion: when you buy a machine head over to the Nespresso store in Soho or Mid-town, sit, relax, sample coffees and buy in bulk for greater savings and to insure you'll always have an on hand supply. I recommend the Ciocattino flavor - good stuff. Enjoy!

..

41191388 I love my Nespresso machine. I was never even a coffee drinker until we got this. It's very easy, just push a button and you have a latte, cappuccino, espresso or a regular coffee. I couldn't live without it!

..

41191388 I use to settle for the drip coffee to avoid having to haul out the espresso machine and then deal with the clean up. Now I don't have to. Thanks.

Prepare a beverage in as little as 1 minute with this Keurig K45 Elite 20218 brewer, which allows you to easily make a single 6-oz., 8-oz. or 10-oz. serving of your favorite hot drink. The 48-oz. removable water tank enables simple filling.


..

41191388 Purchased on recommendation of my son. Love that I get specialty coffee at non-speciality coffee shop prices. Easy. Each person gets their own choice of coffee flavors.

..

41191388 This is a great product! Makes lots of cups of individually brewed coffee very quickly--either hot or iced. Also used for wonderful variety of other products such as teas, lemonade, and hot chocolate. Each serving is fresh and delicious. All of the products are readily available, either online or in a large number of different local stores. I am having a great time experimenting with different flavors of coffees and teas. I am thrilled I bought it!

..

41191388 I bought this for my parents as a Mother's Day/Father's Day gift from my little girl and let me tell you I think it was the best gift I have ever bought them! The best part about it is, it is simple enough that they can use it...just fill it with water & push a button! :-) Now for a fun little game, we buy them a different flavor of K cups every chance we get so they know what they're getting but they don't really know. :-)

..

41191388 It was a present for my mother. She loves coffee, and she loved the keurig!

..

41191388 Love being able to make one cup of coffee and the selection of different K-cups that work with it.

..

41191388 The maker is great for those who love coffee. The different flavors offered is also great.

..

41191388 This is one of the best coffee machines I have ever used would recommend it to anyone

..

41191388 I really like the quick cup of coffee or tea with out putting a pot on. If I want only one cup not having to reheat left over or throwing out if I have friends over I can make a few cups in no time and if we all want different flavors or beverages it's not a problem. For someone that owns the home to have water supplied directly to coffee maker like an ice maker would be nice not having to refill reservoir.

..

41191388 Love the fact that it's water proof and runs off blue tooth

..

41191388 Perfect for a quick cup in the morning or whenever.

38538813 So I bought the box for my 2 12" Polk subs. I bought it thinking it was white to go with my white car and it turned out to be a more silver metal looking color. The box is also insanely big, SUV sized box. I drive a 2005 Volvo s60 and the trunks in those are huge, so if you drive a honda civic or similar, it's not going to fit. Besides those points it's a great box and it looks good.
